"Ananda\nBeautiful disasters:\nA crushed flower on the pavement.\nSunshine peeking through the trees and into your eyes.\nBreakfast with one mouthful left.\nHot chocolate before the marshmallows have melted.\nLong silences as we look into each other\u2019s eyes.\nYou:\nPhotographs where you\u2019re blinking.\nSinging at the top of your lungs even though you can\u2019t hold a note.\nLipstick stain on your skin.\nLights being put away on Boxing Day.\nSex after a fight.\nHugs goodbye.\nSpilling glitter on the carpet.\nSnow seeping through your shoes.\nA love song crossed out with pen.\nMe:\nCoffee cake.\nReading the same book for the fifth time.\nDreaming of you and waking up.\nPresents you pretend to like.\nSleeping without you. \u2666"
