Ananda
Beautiful disasters:
A crushed flower on the pavement.
Sunshine peeking through the trees and into your eyes.
Breakfast with one mouthful left.
Hot chocolate before the marshmallows have melted.
Long silences as we look into each other’s eyes.
You:
Photographs where you’re blinking.
Singing at the top of your lungs even though you can’t hold a note.
Lipstick stain on your skin.
Lights being put away on Boxing Day.
Sex after a fight.
Hugs goodbye.
Spilling glitter on the carpet.
Snow seeping through your shoes.
A love song crossed out with pen.
Me:
Coffee cake.
Reading the same book for the fifth time.
Dreaming of you and waking up.
Presents you pretend to like.
Sleeping without you. ♦
