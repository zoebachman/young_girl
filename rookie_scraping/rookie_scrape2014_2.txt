Not a lot of people know that I was homeschooled until I was almost eight years old. In the scheme of things, it’s not a very long time. I only missed about two years of sitting in a classroom seven hours a day. But I think even I forget just how much of an impact those two years made on me.
I learned to read when I was three. My mom always says it’s because I saw my older brother reading books and wanted to do the same—just like how I walked on my own at nine months, apparently out of sheer stubbornness. Our family would spend hours every week at the library, where I was left to my own devices and allowed to choose books for myself. I could walk home with books about everything—poetry, fantasy, science—nestled in my arms.
And I would read it all. I pored over hefty collections of poetry and marked my favorites with sticky notes. I read all my mom’s old Nancy Drew books, and when those ran out we bought more from a tiny used bookstore hidden in our cramped downtown. When I ran out of things to read, I started writing. I discovered I could create my own worlds when authors’ weren’t enough.
When I wasn’t reading or writing, I was out. My parents gave me a bike and some limits on how far away from home I could go—boundaries that I promptly disregarded in favor of finding the easiest route to the library, or my dad’s office, or a coffee shop on the edge of the university campus. I looked at life with childish excitement and determination and not a speck of anxiety or uncertainty.
But! I thought to myself, writing this, Why do I refer to that feeling as “childish” excitement and determination? Why can’t that apply to me as a teenager just as it did as a kid?
In English class today I read this essay by Ben Hewitt on the concept of “unschooling,” which is similar to homeschooling but minimizes the use of an actual curriculum. I finished the piece and, instead of answering the questions my teacher had given us, started drafting this diary entry in my notebook.
It was dawning on me that “unschooling” may have been a much more accurate term for my early childhood. My brother and I spent very little time sitting down to do our “schoolwork,” although I readily tackled my textbooks of my own accord. I have a vivid memory of stealing my brother’s spelling book when I had finished my own and becoming obsessed with the word “appendix.” But it never felt like school to me. If I got bored, I put down the pencil and strapped on my bike helmet.
Maybe that’s why the uncertainty started to kick in. At home, it felt like everything was at my fingertips; it only takes a few moments to pedal down the driveway. But once I started going to public school, I would come home too tired to climb onto my bicycle. My parents began driving me to my new friends’ houses instead of sending me off on my own. And the world felt a lot smaller when it consisted of the same 20 faces every day.
Now I know that the world is much bigger than I ever imagined as a child. But it’s frightening and unattainable. I constantly wish that I could get out more, seek out new experiences even within the limitations of my own town, but I rarely—if ever—do anything about it. And that needs to change.
I want to have things to talk about in these diary entries that aren’t repetitive complaints of how monotonous my life has become. I need to escape that monotony. Even if it’s just letting myself scream out loud at a soccer game on TV, switching up my coffee order on Sunday mornings, or finally walking into the bike shop that I’ve been curious about for months. It’s time to take a stand. ♦

I should’ve known better than to start trying to enrich my life with memorable experiences two weeks before final exams.
It’s not a big deal, I argued with myself. I only need to be doing preliminary studying, and I have to focus on my tests this week rather than the bigger exams next week, anyway. But it’s hard to reason with yourself—or study, for that matter—when you’re exhausted and nauseous all day, like I was this weekend. ’Tis the season.
Now, rather than going out and making something of these last few weeks of the semester, I struggle to find the motivation I need to study, to keep my grades up, to hold out these last days. Tonight my family is decorating for the holidays. I can go home, watch soccer, and allow myself to relax for a final few hours before I buckle down. I am almost free.

At the end of a dark night, dawn broke, and life came back to me. That was the moment my mother arrived to see us. She finally made it. I won’t even try to express how I felt, because there are no words to describe the feeling. What’s important is that my wish had come true: My family was together after I had almost given up on ever seeing my mom again. My sisters and I had struggled and suffered so much after we realized how important my mother was to us. We realized the importance of having her around, and how much she had taken on for us. 
I can’t deny that dealing with her absence has been an exercise in character building and in developing the ability to make our own decisions, but we will never forget all the setbacks we faced because we felt lost and unanchored. We were all nervous wrecks. But all that is OK now, because she’s returned to us.
My sisters, mother, and I stayed at my aunt’s for two days before we started looking for our own place. We found that in the clinic of an expat doctor, which is close to my sister’s school where she is preparing for her government exams and often returns home late at night. The rent, though high, was still cheaper than other places we looked at. We immediately moved in, happy that we were together, ignoring the facts that it’s winter and the clinic is completely devoid of any furniture. My mother bought two blankets. We laid one out on the floor and are using the other to stay warm.
Our first night back with our mother was special. The warmth we had for one another overpowered the scathing cold that filled our little room. I held my mother’s hand and went to bed. We started tugging at the blanket, each of us trying to hog the covers in an attempt to keep warm. We were laughing, almost crying even, and I don’t even know why. Perhaps it was happiness, or perhaps it was us trying to conceal our true feelings. We woke up beaming, with smiles on our faces despite the bellyaches brought about by the cold.
Our happiness did not last for long. A week later, we found ourselves faced with a harsh reality. My mother wasn’t able to pay the rent and the bills and provide for us, because she is now unemployed. The school in the city doesn’t have open positions. How will our poor mother cope with everything? I thought long and hard about it, but I can’t leave my studies, as I need to finish and apply what I’ve learned. I am unable to work and go to school at the same time. I’m truly scared for us, despite my mother’s optimism. I know how worried she is, and she is often distracted. I don’t know how our lives will turn out to be when we live in the capital. It’s not as easy as we thought it would be, and it’s a lifetime away from anything I experienced in my hometown. Here, everyone is busy looking after their own interests, and no one cares about anyone but themselves.
Life is truly strange. Every day you encounter something new, and problems always seem to pop up. Fate made us leave our hometown and our big house to live in this small, simple room. I don’t know what the meaning behind it is. But I often wonder under what law, by whose order, and until when will our right to live with dignity continue to be ignored? ♦

“Do you think you haven’t been running and playing soccer because you’re afraid of reinjuring yourself?” my mom asked the other day.
I told her no—that I haven’t been running simply because my physical therapist told me to avoid it for a while. But then I recounted the conversation to a friend, who said, “Who could blame you if you were? You’ve been playing injured ever since you hurt your hamstring injury a couple of years ago.”
It would  be a decent reason. My hamstring injury went completely undiagnosed, treated only with a 13-year-old’s common sense and as much ice as our freezer could churn out. It still regularly causes me pain, if only at night, when muscle cramps are wont to set in anyway. I’ve been playing soccer for years with the knowledge in the back of my mind that one misstep, one awkward turn, one nasty slide tackle could leave me on the ground—and maybe, this time, I wouldn’t be able to get up.
That scares me more than anything. But in order to overcome this new injury and get back on the field, I need to overcome that mental block. It’s been holding me back for over a month now—a month that wouldn’t have been easy to get through mentally, even with the relief that my sport brings.
It might sound silly, that a person’s life could be so closely intertwined with a sport, but it’s the truth. It’s been incredibly hard to hold myself together for the past six or seven weeks. I’ve never felt more on edge, more unlike myself.
It rained today, just on and off, but enough to drive me back inside anytime I dared to venture out. It wasn’t how I planned to spend my first day of winter break. I wanted to drive out to a hiking trail or a soccer field, anything to get my feet on something other than wooden floors. Instead, I stayed inside and tried to write and failed, over and over, hitting the backspace key on my laptop in increasing frustration.
The faster I recover physically, the faster I will recover mentally and emotionally. I have two months until conditioning starts for spring season, and I swear to myself that I will be ready for it. ♦

I know in some ways it’s silly to think of January 1 as different from any other day of the year. Time and time again, I’ve heard, “You don’t need a new year to create a new you,” and whatnot, but ’tis the season, so although I don’t like calling them “resolutions,” here are some of my goals for 2015…and beyond.

 Rehab my hip, which is, of course, at the forefront of my mind as we go into 2015. As of January 1, it will have been two months since I set foot on a competitive soccer field, and I’ll have less than two months remaining until practices start for the high school season. Yikes.
 On a related note, run more. I forgot how much I love to run until I couldn’t. Over the past week, I’ve been getting back into it as my hip starts to heal. I’m allowing myself light workouts on the treadmill to try to get my stamina back. But that’s not enough—I want to run 5Ks; 10Ks; I want to run around my town as slowly as I need to in order to see everything in detail. Treadmills aren’t very satisfying, seeing as you never actually get anywhere.
 Stay organized. I start every semester ready and raring to go, armed with way too many binders and folders that are way too complicated to use for more than a week. I want to figure out some simple method that I can stick to for the rest of the school year. Anything to stress less.
  Go somewhere new whenever I can. Whether it’s the Women’s World Cup in Canada (starting June 6!) or summer camp in Washington or simply biking to a new coffee shop to study, I want to expand my perspective. My trip to Ireland this past summer only left me wanting more.
 Record said experiences. This might be by keeping a daily journal, or forcing myself to stick to a blog, or turning my new video camera on myself for once.
 Learn to paddleboard. This one seems pretty random, but I’ve wanted to do it every time I’ve been in Florida for the past two or three years and I’ve never actually done it. I’M GOING TO DO IT.

Here’s to 2015. ♦

It’s finally over.
It’s hard to believe it’s only been a matter of months. It seems like I’ve spent years with these girls: so many practices, so many games. It seems like it was ages ago that I was that timid girl who, at the beginning of the season, allowed herself to be shunted into a position

I had my first day at the prostheses institution where I now attend university. For a special session, a professor asked us to observe the amputation of a leg—that is, those who could bear the sight of it. I was among those who volunteered to watch the amputation. I don’t know what drove me to do this. Maybe it was an act of rashness or rebellion? Or was it out of curiosity and the love of knowledge? I don’t know. The time came for the amputation, and the doctor positioned the leg before us. My hands and legs were shaking and my heart was beating too fast. I blacked out, although I looked awake. The whole procedure happened, but it’s as though I didn’t see any of it—I don’t remember how it was done, although I was standing right there with my eyes open. 
My body was there, but my mind and senses were far away, like the scattered body parts and blood in my war-torn town. I suddenly remembered my friend who disappeared, and my father, whose limbs were scattered, and the many disabled people in my hometown. They all came before my eyes, shielding what was happening in front of me. Despite my desperate need to reveal my pain, I held back. I wished I could cry and shout, but I chose to remain silent. I couldn’t tell anyone how I felt. I went home to my bed, where I’m used to drowning myself with tears of hurt and anger. I left my hometown hoping to forget all the injustices and horrors I went through, but it seems impossible to let go. I always remember the past. Although I always try to ignore my memories of home, both sweet and bitter, I always fail. 
The funny yet sad part of the story is that the other students revered me for witnessing the amputation. They started asking me questions about it, but I was blank. I thought and thought, and I still don’t have a logical explanation for what happened. To stare at something without seeing it at all: Maybe it was because I forced my eyes to see something they refused to see, so my brain blocked my vision. I really am astonished. I truly hope I can forget. 
The doctor praised me for hanging in there and not stepping back, too. He told me that, with time, I will get used to it. But the truth is, I don’t want to ever get used to it. I fear that I might have chosen the wrong field of study, because it requires a strong and healthy heart. But my heart is full of probably untreatable pain, so will I be able to go on? I don’t know. Am I brave, or a coward? Sick, or normal? I don’t know. I just know that I want to live in peace. ♦

I’ve entered that brief period of the year where the sky is gray all the time and the days all blur together. The cold has finally set in; it snowed today, enough to leave traces of white all over trees and bushes and grass, like a taste of what’s to come. I love the style of winter clothes, but I’ve never felt comfortable in them myself. I prefer sunlight on bare legs and arms to the biting wind that is so characteristic of where I live. This is not my favorite time of year. The autumn gales gnaw at my bones and make my skin crawl. 
This time of year, I have to constantly remind myself to be productive. It’s too easy to sit around in sweatpants, drink tea, stare out the window, and play music that’s as dismal and colorless as the weather outside. But I can’t let my daily life degenerate into something that dull—not when there are books to read and rooms to clean and tests to study for and workouts to finish. If I have to chase out this feeling of unconquerable monotony with running shoes and textbooks and vacuum cleaners, so be it. Anything to finish the day feeling like I’ve accomplished something. Anything at all.

I am writing this immediately after the Ferguson decision, and the announcement that Darren Wilson is to go free. In this moment I’ll admit: I am numb. I am uncertain. I know where I stand on the matter, but not what I, a young white girl, can do to make a difference.
I’ve always struggled with that. I spend so much time worrying about homework and soccer practice and even things as superficial as my appearance day after day after day that I allow myself to forget the bigger picture that I live in. When I am pulled harshly out of my bubble by incidents like this, I feel just as helpless as I would if I were still stuck in my own self-centered routine. I stayed up all night last year for Wendy Davis’ Senate filibuster, my heart in my throat, feeling more powerless than I ever had before. Tonight is the same kind of night.
In moments like these, I think, What could I do to help? I’m 16, introverted, and rooted to the ground in my hometown. And I’m scared. And I’m trying to be honest here. Right now, all I can do, at 10 PM, with school tomorrow, is curl up in bed with To Kill A Mockingbird and try to allow myself a few hours of quiet.

I am finally home after my first soccer tournament, and I cannot remember the last time I was this exhausted. That’s not surprising, considering I played four games in 40 hours. I have dozens of bruises and scrapes and sore muscles that somehow made it through all the stress I’ve put them under in the past three days or so. Now, I finally have the time to fully rest and recover.
Our first game of the four was played on artificial turf. Fake grass has its pros and cons. Lots of players, especially on the high school and club levels, are overjoyed to be playing on a completely smooth surface. But for me, the cons far outweigh the advantages. When I run on artificial turf, it feels like the impact of each step bounces right back into my legs. The ball bounces weirdly when you’re least expecting it. If you hit the ground for any reason, the blades of “grass” slice your legs like a million tiny paper cuts.
Worst of all, some types of man-made turf produce more friction than natural grass does, leading to a higher risk of injury. We didn’t only lose our first game, we also lost two players to potentially season-ending injuries: a fractured wrist and a possibly broken ankle. It’s for reasons like this that I wonder how professional players ever play on turf.
Our next two games were on natural grass, but that didn’t stop us from losing two more players to injuries! Our fourth match was this morning, while all of us were still exhausted and stiff. Making matters worse, when our coach called us together after our warmup, he announced, “It looks like we’re playing with 10.”
Soccer is usually played with 11 active players per team. We had only 10 available to put on the field, while the other team had 18: 11 for the field and seven substitutes. I could feel all our hearts sink in unison. We were tired and sore and demoralized by our losses earlier in the tournament, and I think we all just wanted it to be over.
We took the field anyway and, miraculously, scored the first goal. That was an accomplishment in itself. Goals are generally few and far between in a soccer match. The other team then evened the score and got two more goals on top of that, but we made them fight tooth and nail for every inch they advanced down the field. It didn’t matter that they could bring on seven pairs of fresh legs every few minutes. We took their misplaced elbows and well-timed sprints and refused to back down. We may have lost, but it was the strongest we’ve looked all season—without breaks, without any loss of intensity, and without a full team to boot.
I learned something about my team and myself today. In the face of adversity, when it feels like we can’t go on, we can pull ourselves together and fight until the final whistle blows. I have never been more proud. ♦

A reminder to myself: Time is relentless.
When my legs are dragging and I feel like I can’t take another step, the clock still ticks. While I fidget in the last class of the day, thinking of all the homework I’ll have when I get home, time goes on. When I toss and turn in bed, unable to sleep, or when I’m anxious and I lean against a wall to feel its solidity, I must remind myself that every single moment will pass.
In moments of anxiety or pain or despair, it’s not easy to think clearly. It feels like I can’t think loud enough to drown out everything else in my head. I don’t need to be told to “take deep breaths,” or “just calm down.” I’m already telling myself that, shouting it to myself in my mind, desperate to be heard above the commotion. All I need to know in moments like that is that those moments will end. I can keep good ones in my memories and find solace in the fact that the bad ones will fade eventually.
Life goes on. ♦

Not long ago, I was shrouded in darkness. Then I saw a light at the end of the tunnel: I passed my government exams and graduated from high school. This was the moment I had always dreamed of and had fought hard for. My heart skipped a beat, my emotions ran wild, I felt like my joy was too great to be contained by the world itself. I had a new lease on life!
Now, I embark on a new journey: I have left al-Ghouta, my war-besieged hometown, and enrolled at a university in Damascus, our capitol, to continue my education. I feel more mature and aware. That might sound silly, but I truly feel like earning my high school degree has changed me. I feel like a new person, on the threshold of a new life, after having weathered so much suffering. I will open the door to this next phase with strong arms and a steady heart. I will try my best to live up to this dream that for so long seemed impossible to attain. In spite of the rigid educational system here, which dictates what you can and can’t study according to your grades, I will find a way to study a subject I love. I am well aware that this is but the beginning, but I am certain of the importance of this first step.
I called my mother in al-Ghouta to tell her the news. Her trembling voice revealed her happiness as she congratulated me. She asked me to share the story of my success with my two sisters. They had left al-Ghouta a month earlier and moved in with our great-uncle in al-Tal, an area far from the capital. My mother stayed behind, as leaving the city requires a lot of money and even more paperwork, neither of which she has finished putting together. I heeded my mother’s advice and went to pay my sisters a visit, crossing many checkpoints on the way. We spent a happy, joyous evening together—the kind of night I haven’t had in way too long.
But it seems all our fun had angered the fates, because the next morning al-Tal was hit by heavy shelling. The city went on lockdown; no one was allowed to leave. I spent two days locked up in my great-uncle’s house, filled with a terror that has become all too familiar to me. It’s unbelievable how this quiet city turned into a battleground the moment I arrived! 
I wonder why we are denied joy. Will I never be allowed to feel real happiness again? I don’t know what happened or what will happen, but I know that I am stronger than I used to be, and I will overcome all obstacles to live in a new world—one I will create for myself. ♦

I remember my father every day. I miss him and I wish he were still here. I wish he could share my joy at finally going to college. I decided to enroll at the pharmacology institution in Damascus, which was a dream he always had for me. Today I made his wish come true, and he is not around to bless my success.
I will study here for two years, then I will do two more years at a specialized pharmacology college. After I finish, I plan to open a medical laboratory of my own. My classes start next week. I’m so happy about this new phase of my life that I am starting to see a glimpse of hope; I feel that a whole different life is ahead of me. I don’t know how the future will work out, but I’m looking forward to living it. 
Life is vast with open doors, but my mind always tempers my joy with a fear of disappointment and frustration. At my age, you might imagine that I’d be an adventurous, wild teenager with some handsome guy in my life, but I’m not like that. The pain of war forced me to get over all that. It turned me into a very serious girl. I realize that fear is my weakness: fear of the unknown future, of fate. I don’t trust fate anymore; it keeps taking happiness away from me. I have reached a point when my motto has become: After the rain, there is always a flood, and after the calmness of the sea, there is always a storm of waves. 
I’m not weak. I know my goals and I’m going after them, but I’m a human being, not a stone. And I question where my place is in all of this. Am I going to be worthy of the future? The answer will be revealed the coming days. ♦

Something happened to me that may have changed the course of my life. I saw a little child with one leg, walking and leaning on a stick, and then he suddenly fell to the ground and smashed his nose. Although his father was next to him, I ran to him and held his hand to help him up. His father told me that they came from one of the damaged areas in my country. The child had lost his leg as a result of being hit by missile fragments, and they came here to Damascus to seek treatment for his condition, after a lot of paperwork and bitter struggles. I came back home with so many thoughts troubling my mind. I started picturing the disabled children and young people in every street in my hometown. I felt their pain and suffering, and then there was this weird feeling of missing my town and its people. I miss it and long for it, even after I went through all the trouble to run away from it. I still can’t figure my soul out. Sometimes I feel my soul seeking its ambition, and sometimes I feel very weak and vulnerable, worn out by pain and devoid of feelings toward those I love…that’s if I still can feel love!
And for the first time I’ve started asking myself: What have I done to my town, to my people? What is my duty now that I have become aware of and responsible for my country?
I spent the whole night sleepless, and I kept seeing those images in al-Ghouta, like a constant film of suffering repeated over and over again, and then a crazy new idea that I had never thought of before hit me. The idea was to leave my field of study and move from pharmacology to learning about prosthetic limbs and physical treatment, because my country and its people are in extreme need for people working in this field.
I told my mother, and she encouraged me to quit pharmacology, as she knows I only went for it to fulfill my father’s wish. She supports my choices. I wish I could study prosthetics abroad—it would enable me to fulfill my duty to my people. Maybe if I do this, my soul will be at peace, and it may calm the restless chaos and constant worries inside me. Is it a right or wrong decision? ♦

When I was in elementary school, all I really cared about was books—books I was reading and books I was writing. I saw the world through the filter of how I could write about it: how to describe a scene, how to relay everything I saw, sensed, and felt to someone reading my words. I definitely appreciated visual art and still do, but I have always struggled to express myself with pencils or paint. Words come easier to me.
If I were to go back and read the stuff I was writing back then, I’m sure I would wince at my tortured metaphors and pretentious turns of phrase. But back then I wasn’t afraid of my writing; in fact, I was eager to share it. My friends and I started a small writing club, and I looked forward to our after-school meetings, where we took turns reading our stuff out loud, assuming ridiculous voices for different characters and steadfastly refusing to describe our kissing scenes. (We were third-graders. I’m surprised any of us wrote about kissing at all.)
After a year of weekly writing club meetings, I decided to enter my elementary school’s writing competition. Each year, five winners were selected and got to skip a day of school for our school district’s young authors’ conference, where they could take part in writing workshops and meet young-adult authors. One of the five would then get a chance to attend the state conference in a city two hours away.
I sent in a fantasy piece about a book with dragons sleeping inside it and a girl who wakes them up. It was short and full of the elaborate descriptions and ornate imagery that were my hallmark as a writer. I won the school competition, then the district-wide one, and then I was sent off to the state conference, cheered on by the other members of the writing club.
The next year, I wrote a story about a boy who is a distant descendant of a race of mythical beings and who discovers that he is next in line for their throne. I won again. It felt good to be acknowledged for the thing I loved to do.
I stopped writing early in middle school, and I’m not entirely sure why. I still read almost as much as I used to, but the words that used to fill so many notebooks have stopped flowing from my brain. Maybe it’s because I’ve been too busy trying to juggle being a soccer jock and a queer lady and a math nerd to maintain another interest, but you’d think those things would feed my writing, not hinder it!
I’m going to write more. I’m choosing a busy time of year to start, but I know I can make the time for it. Whether it’s diary entries like I write here, creative snippets, finally cranking out some pieces of the novel I’ve had in my head for years…I don’t care. I miss writing. This can be a fresh start. ♦

My soccer team won our first game of the season tonight, 1–0. Half an hour later, our second game ended on a 1–1 draw.
It was not only my first match with my new team, but also my first time playing center back. There were definitely some tense moments where our opponents nearly scored, and I had to cover for my mistakes with raw speed, outsprinting the other team as they closed in on the goal. It felt good and also terrifying and also like I was venturing into the unknown.
Now that my thoughts have settled a little, I’m finally able to look ahead. Of course I made mistakes—any rookie in a brand new position would. But while I started the week feeling lost and uncertain about my place on the team, now I can see the path ahead. I have a starting point. From here I can only improve.
I’m home now and have showered off the sweat and the stiffness in my muscles, but my heart is still racing. Tomorrow I will wear my bruises like battle scars. ♦

I didn’t have any soccer games this weekend. After the thrill of last week, when my team won our first game of the season, this week felt like a letdown. I ended up dragging my parents out to a local field, where I ran drills until I couldn’t anymore. I spent close to an hour on one single drill that focused on one of my weak points, repeating it over and over until I got it.
It amazes me how athletes can find hidden reserves of strength in crucial moments. When it feels like they can’t do any more, they keep going. It amazes me when I find this strength in myself. After an hour-plus of solo drills out on the field, I could feel myself slowing down, starting to scramble, making simple mistakes. I got angry at myself for slacking. I got angry at the field for making the ball bounce to weird heights and at the goal for being smaller than the goals I’m used to. But I channeled all of that fury into that one drill, and finally saw an improvement.
As an athlete, I often have to play through pain. If I get a calf cramp or roll an ankle or pull a hamstring, I have to power through, at least until my coach can put someone else on the field in my place. What’s important to remember in these moments is that mental strength is way more important than physical strength—my body will stop when I allow it to.
Of course, I know when I absolutely have to stop playing. I hear way too many scary stories about sports injuries to feel otherwise. It’s important to know your limit so that you can play all the way to that limit but never try to surpass it. When I find myself struggling to finish a workout or debating whether or not to spring that last hill or crank out that last pushup, I think about those horror stories and remind myself how lucky I am to have the ability to keep going. I am so grateful to be able to play the sport that I love.
I know that there are athletes who read Rookie. Given the realities of sports, some of you are currently injured and recovering. If that’s you, I know you’re probably freaked out about your diminished physical strength. But don’t worry so much about that—that’ll come back. Focus instead on your mental strength, because that’s just as important right now, if not more so, as it is will be when you’re back the thick of the action. Stay strong. ♦

I’ve spent the past few weeks trying to keep up with my sports and academics commitments—endless fitness classes and steadily growing mountains of homework. I’ve pounded out miles on the track at school, swearing under my breath at the dull pain of each step. I’ve stayed up later than I should finishing assignments and essays. None of these problems is unique to me—any high school athlete is going through the same thing. But knowing that doesn’t make it any easier. I’m starting to crumble under all the stress.
Everything else got put on hold for my soccer club’s games today. We lost the first one but won the second by a landslide, and I haven’t felt this confident since playing for my high school team last spring. My speed, my movement on the field, my footwork on the ball—everything felt so natural again! I’m playing a new position—center back—and while it’s still not my favorite, I’m coming to accept that, on this team at least, it’s where I belong. 
I still have a mountain of homework to do tonight, but the high from that second game is making me feel like I can handle anything. ♦

When I was in elementary school, all I really cared about was books—books I was reading and books I was writing. I saw the world through the filter of how I could write about it: how to describe a scene, how to relay everything I saw, sensed, and felt to someone reading my words. I definitely appreciated visual art and still do, but I have always struggled to express myself with pencils or paint. Words come easier to me.
If I were to go back and read the stuff I was writing back then, I’m sure I would wince at my tortured metaphors and pretentious turns of phrase. But back then I wasn’t afraid of my writing; in fact, I was eager to share it.

Last week the days were just flying by; now they’re in free fall.
Club soccer starts next week. That’s a program that lets girls in my district play in the fall and winter, before the official season starts in the spring. I’ve ordered my uniforms and found the perfect pair of cleats (highlighter yellow, and the most lightweight I’ve ever worn). I’ll be hurrying to break them in before our first tournament, which could come as soon as the end of this month. I’m pretty nervous: Club teams are harder to get onto than high school teams, since girls from all over the district try out for them, so the level of competition is much higher. But a couple of other girls from my school will be on my team, so at least I’ll know someone there. 
School starts a week after that. I’m crossing my fingers that I haven’t taken on more than I can handle. I was given the option to skip pre-calculus and go straight into actual calculus, and I took it; I’ve also added two elective science classes to my workload. But those are all classes I’m excited for—some that I’ve wanted to take for years, but had to wait till I’d completed a bunch of prerequisites. 
I’m spending the last few weeks of summer kind of coasting, focusing on simple pleasures in the moment and trying not to think about the road ahead. Early Friday morning, I ran to the park near our old house and sat on top of the climbing wall for a while, silently reliving childhood memories. I baked misshapen cookies and the best scones I’ve ever tasted. I went to see a local band play an outdoor show, and laughed as the crowd danced on the concrete under the smoke and sky. Not much has really happened lately, which is exactly what I wanted.
One more week. I’m hoping it’s just as relaxing. ♦

Though the two cities are less than half an hour apart by car, life in Damascus, the capital of Syria, and life in al-Ghouta, my hometown, are as different as heaven and hell. Al-Ghouta felt like a backward country; Damascus, where I’ve been going to school for the past month or so, is like a fully developed European nation, with food, clothes, gas, and electricity all available at normal prices. Sometimes the electricity goes out for a few hours, and people complain about the heat. I want to tell them that this is nothing compared with the outages in al-Ghouta, which can last several days! The lights that flood houses and roads at night are so bright that that I had to wear sunglasses my first few nights here!
The schools in Damascus still have teachers. There are people working in the public parks, restaurants, playgrounds, and clubs. The markets are full. Shelling and military checkpoints are rare. Boys walk around in nice clothes, flirting with girls. They still have desires beyond food and life. 
I can’t deny that I’m enjoying the luxuries here—such as ice cream, which I hadn’t tasted for more than a year.
But not everything is normal. This is still a city in the middle of a war. Damascus is filled with life in the daytime, but most of it stops at night. People are afraid of being out at night.
Eastern Ghouta, where I’m from, is controlled by the opposition, which many people in Damascus blame for the current turmoil in Syria. I tell them that we ate cattle feed regularly to stay alive, but they don’t believe me. I tell them prices for everything in Ghouta are incredibly high, that food is being stolen, but they don’t care. They think we live in luxury because the United Nations sent aid, in the form of food and medical supplies, to our city last spring. They don’t seem to understand that that stuff was not enough for more than one percent of our population.
My mother insists on staying in al-Ghouta. She is a teacher, and she says the local children need her there. I hope she decides to move to the capital, where life is easier and more comfortable. I don’t want her to go through another winter in al-Ghouta. I can’t bear the thought of any of us going through that suffering and pain again. ♦

We got our schedules for the upcoming school year in the mail back in May. I opened the envelope and frowned.
“They gave me computer programming instead of chemistry,” I told my parents. Then I added: “And I’m going to fix that.”
We’re allowed to change our schedules to a certain extent, but you have to get your request in early. I went to see my counselor the next day and successfully argued for the changes I wanted: an advanced chemistry class, to switch to the PE class my friends are in, and one free period. I came home relieved and happy, clutching the printout of my new schedule like I was afraid someone would snatch it away.
Fast-forward to last week, when an new copy of my schedule arrived in the mail. Imagine my horror upon discovering that all the changes I had made had been reversed! Within minutes, I had composed a hopeful message to the school administration, hit send, and waited.
After several days with no response, I reread the letter that came with my schedule. It said they wouldn’t respond to emails about schedule changes.
“I didn’t do anything wrong,” I moaned to my parents. “I did everything they asked us to. There’s no way they could have re-created my original schedule after the changes I made.”
“It sounds like your counselor didn’t save the changes he made,” said my mom.
I emailed my counselor to ask what had happened. Later that very same day, I got a call from a teacher who told me that there had indeed been a computer glitch, and that they would do their best to switch everything back. There was one problem, though: The chemistry class I wanted was already full. 
I wasn’t ready to give up. This is my junior year: the year of standardized tests and rigorous workloads and getting to show colleges what you can do. The year when everything counts. Luckily, that chem class is being taught by the guy I had for science last year. I wrote one last, desperate email:
“I’ve been pulled out of your chemistry class,” I explained. I asked if there was any way he could squeeze in one more student. “If that’s impossible,” I wrote, “do you have any recommendations for reputable online chemistry courses?” 
The response came within minutes. He promised to speak to the school counselors about the issue, and the next day a PDF was sitting in my inbox. It was my schedule for the fall semester, exactly how I had wanted it.
I know this may seem like the most banal story ever: There was a problem, I notified someone, the problem was fixed. But the moral of the story is important to me: Don’t give up. I wouldn’t have gotten the classes I wanted if I hadn’t kept emailing everyone. I often talk myself out of chasing things like this. This experience was a useful reminder that persistence really works. ♦

The other night, my soccer coach announced that we’d be practicing against an older girls’ team. I was pumped for the challenge, and looked forward to testing out my skills and confidence against more-experienced players. Then he called out our names and what positions we’d be playing. When he got to me, my heart sank: “Lilly: center back.”
OK. A little exposition: I have always played forward. A forward’s job is to score goals. If I can’t do it myself, I get the ball to a teammate who can. I have spent hours upon hours training to play aggressively and offensively, always looking for a way to put the ball into the net. Center back, on the other hand, is almost exactly the opposite of the position I play. It’s the last line of defense before the goalkeeper, and mainly concerned with making sure that the other team’s forwards don’t score. Telling me to play center back is like telling a trumpeter to play the tuba.
I was nervous as I ran onto the field. My first big test came when one of the other team’s forwards broke away with the ball, closing down on our goalkeeper. I caught up to her and got goalside (a spot between the ball and the goal I was defending). Because of my experience as a forward, I knew exactly what she was thinking and could anticipate her moves. And that’s how I was able to stop her, wrangling the ball away as soon as she tried to get it past me.
“I’ve never played defense before,” I told the coach afterwards. He laughed and said I did fine. 
Since then, I’ve gotten better. To the point where I might actually become my team’s official center back this season. It’s an intimidating prospect, but I like to think I’m up for the challenge. I’m not saying tuba is an easy instrument, but this trumpeter just might be able to learn. ♦

I lie still in the wet grass, panting, sweat rolling down my brow in beads. I’m on a roll—more than twice as many as last week, I tell myself, referring to the set of push-ups I just did.
It’s not quite seven o’clock in the morning, and the air around me is thick and humid and rapidly approaching 80 degrees. One of my dad’s friends, a soccer referee and cyclist, is watching me from the bench where we do triceps dips. Three times a week, he arrives at our doorstep at 6 AM sharp to put me through whatever intense workout he’s chosen for the day. It’s always killer. 
Later that day, my mother says, “Sometimes I hear you laughing outside and wonder what he could possibly be putting you through.” I tell her everything we did that morning and she shakes her head. “At least you’ll be ready for club season in the fall,” she says.
For years, playing soccer for a statewide team/club seemed like an unattainable dream. Those teams were for the really talented girls who entered the program long before their teenage years. But now here I am, despite that fact that my years of “training” took place in totally recreational, noncompetitive contexts—the most official “coach” I ever had was my dad. I had little hope when I tried out for the team, but I tried out anyway, and I made it. And for the first time, I feel like I deserve it. 
Whenever I start doubting myself, I think about Ella Massar. My family used to go to see her play for the University of Illinois back when I was still too young to focus on the game for more than a few minutes at a time. I was lucky enough to meet Ella last year at a soccer clinic she held in my town, where I learned that she didn’t start playing club soccer until she was 15, the same age I am now. Not long after that, she joined the Illinois team, and now she’s playing professionally for the Houston Dash. The night before a tough practice, I often write Ella’s number, 30, on the back of my hand.
When I walk into the kitchen after my next workout, my mom says, “I think you live and breathe soccer more than any of your teammates do.”
I say, “I try.” ♦

When I don’t leave the house all day, I become a danger to myself. Cursed as I am with a Netflix subscription, it’s too easy to reach for a bag of popcorn and hit play on yet another John Hughes movie. I cleaned my room today to make myself feel better, but even organized bookshelves and a pristine floor can’t distract me from the fact that my summer is whittling itself away.
“Let’s go to the park tonight,” I said to my dad. I texted my best friend to let her know we were heading there, and a little while later my parents and I were on our bikes on the way to a city park that boasts a large grassy field and the best kind of old wooden playground.
As we walked out onto the field, my dad asked, “Who wants to fly first?”
I was first to volunteer: “I will!”
Fly as in kites. My dad collects them—specifically, he collects foil kites, lightweight contraptions, often wider than I am tall, controlled by two strings. The first one we launched in the park is huge—about 32 square feet—and has dragged every member of my family across countless fields and beaches. In tonight’s light wind, it was easy to control as long as I kept the straps wrapped around my wrists and my feet firmly planted. It feels like having a living, breathing animal at the other end of the strings as the kite pulls you this way and that, whistling through the air on every pass and forcing you to hold tight just to keep your footing. Then the wind drops and the lines suddenly go slack and you go reeling backwards. It’s fantastic.
Just as I was regaining my feel for the beast, crossing and uncrossing the strings, sending it on lazy loop-the-loops, then sending it into a nosedive to see how close I could get it to the ground before bringing it back up unscathed, my friend arrived with her family. They’d brought their own foil kite, which had yet to make its inaugural flight. Once theirs was successfully airborne, I handed our kite’s lines to my dad and headed for the playground with my friend and her little brother.
Playing tag on playgrounds is harder than it was when I was little. I kept hitting my head on overhangs and parallel bars. But the fun we had, and how hard we laughed, made the bruises totally worth it.
I realized something important today: No matter how much I talk about wanting to do things and experience stuff, nothing is going to happen unless I make it so. Every box on my bucket list—surfing, building bikes, running trails through forests—will only be checked off if I take the initiative to find those experiences.
I just want to have a summer worth remembering. And I still have plenty of time. ♦

I came to Damascus to take my baccalaureate exams, and decided to stay and continue my education here. I am overwhelmed with classes and homework, trying hard to be the best student in school. But, although I am staying with relatives, I don’t know them very well, I feel very alone here. I long for my mother, my siblings, my friends, my city. How strange that it took my getting the things I craved back home, like abundant food and electricity, for me to appreciate what I had there that I don’t have here: the warmth and security of family. Without my family, I feel like a withering plant that was cut off from its roots.
Life is weird. It is a strict teacher that makes you overcome its difficulties so you can learn from your experiences. I’m learning more and more in the classroom here, but the outside world is teaching me harsher lessons.
A lot of the time here, I don’t know what to say. I really don’t. I am adjusting to this new life. Maybe I need my mother’s help. If I had more money, I would make my mother come live here with me. And my younger sister could join us, and she could finally enjoy round-the-clock electricity too.
I am suddenly unsure of myself. Will I achieve my dream and go to college? Or will I end up drifting off to wherever circumstance takes me? I don’t know where my destiny will lead. ♦

I’ve spent the past four days at a soccer camp that has made my life simple and scheduled. We’ve spent six or seven hours on the field each day, split into two practice sessions, followed by a full-length match. Between sessions, we retreated to our dormitories to stretch and complain about our bruises. Our breaks were usually only an hour or so, which meant that anyone who dared fall asleep was going to wake up groggy and not so ready to play.
On one of the days, we wore heart rate monitors: small, innocuous-looking pods that we strapped tightly around our ribs. After that evening’s practice session, my coach showed me the data my little machine had collected: “You stayed in your target heart rate zone longer than anyone else,” she said. “That’s what I call a good work ethic.”
I played my final game this morning, with cramping calves and blistered heels. When it was over, we all stumbled back to the dorms for the last time to empty our rooms and hug our new friends goodbye. High school girls from all over come to this camp. I befriended a pair on my floor that I might not see again unless our teams play against each other.
As we were walking off the field, one of my friends said, “I know we’ve all been complaining about the schedule, but I don’t really want to leave.” None of us did. I’ll probably wake up at 6:30 sharp tomorrow morning, half-expecting to be called down for 8 AM practice. I’ll tape up my remaining injuries and stretch out sore muscles that are finally getting a break. I’ll miss warming up and playing with my friends every day—cramps, blisters, and all. ♦

He is a handsome man in his 50s, with a white face, green eyes, and a gray stripe through his hair. He is well educated. He has never been married. He is an old friend of my late father. He even resembles him, inside and out. He lives far away, in Sweden. We call him Uncle Amjad.
He offered to send money to help my family. I said if he tried, I’d just send it back. He praised my mother for the way she’s raising us. He said my father was lucky to have had her as a wife.
Then he asked me to marry him. He told me I’d be his spoiled princess. He said he’d make all my dreams come true. 
I’m seriously considering it. Why not? He could be my savior, the man who could put me on a magic carpet and carry me from a land of despair to a world where wishes and ambitions stand a chance of being fulfilled. I would move to Sweden, where I could study and have a good life, and Uncle Amjad would take care of me and treat me like a princess. It sounds so much better than staying in Syria, a country that is falling apart.
I told my mother about it. She was furious. She yelled at me for a long time. And then she calmed down and started explaining to me how dangerous it would be for me to accept his offer.
“He is 30 years older than you,” she said. “You won’t be able to understand him. He won’t understand you, either. This is not right for you—try to find your own way. You’re still young. Please, don’t waste yourself like that. You’ll regret it. Marriage is not about relying on someone else completely; it is about sharing. Such a relationship will never be balanced. He would just be like a financier for your ambitions, instead of being a life partner.”
I always trust my mother, no matter what. So for now, my notions of Uncle Amjad have been dashed. But would it really be so bad to marry him? How much worse could that life, as Uncle Amjad’s wife, be than what I’m going through now? It seems like it would be much a more peaceful existence, with no problems and no pain. Is that too much to ask? Is it wrong of me to want it? I need your advice, please. ♦

Last night I said to my mom, “I feel like all of my interests are conflicting with one another.”
She explained that while I’m into a lot of different things, they aren’t necessarily conflicting—it’s just that my stronger passions take precedence over the more “minor” ones.
A part of me knows she’s right, but, obstinate teenager that I am, I refuse to accept that there’s anything “minor” about any of my passions. My mom doesn’t think I should worry about any of this, but I worry about the future. I love science and feminism and sports, but eventually I’ll have to pick one, right? It would be awfully hard to double-major in astrophysics and gender studies, plus play on a Division I soccer team.
I’m in 10th grade, and sometimes I feel like, I still have two whole years of high school left! But other times, I’m like, I only have two years of high school left?! The latter thought hit me hard this spring. I was playing soccer and trying to keep my grades up and attempting to find time for everything else that I wanted to do. Once the school year ended, though, I switched from only to still. All these seemingly endless summer-vacation days give me time to give all my pastimes my full attentions. I come home from the library with stacks of books about feminism and extraterrestrial life (two topics which rarely intersect, alas), then I run and kick things until every muscle in my body is sore. I have time to make being 15 last a little longer. 
And time to write—for example, right now, right here. So hello, Rookie readers! I’m Lilly, and I’m super excited to be sharing my life with you in this diary starting today. Get ready for some geeking out about science and soccer and math. ♦

Editor’s note: Marah is still in Damascus, but her editors at Syria Deeply just sent us this entry, which she wrote before she left.
Tomorrow my dreams will come true. I will bid my family farewell, leave my hometown, and head to Damascus, the capital of Syria, to sit for my high school final exams.
I’m happy and scared at the same time. The fear is overwhelming! I will have to go through two checkpoints, where I will be searched and asked for my identification papers. Supposing I’m able to pass safely through the checkpoints, the next step will be to go to the home of some of my relatives, with whom I’ll be staying. How will life be with them? I don’t know them super well, and this will be my first time staying at their house. Will I feel comfortable? 
I’m currently studying as much as I can. But the harsh living conditions here and regular power outages don’t always allow me to study well. 
I often wonder if I will be able to fulfill my bigger dreams, and whether I am worthy of them. My mother’s happiness hinges on my success. She has worked herself to the bone to get me to where I am today. She smiles at me, but I know she’s even more confused and scared than I am. She tries to reassure me, but I know that she’s worried. I can tell she’s heartbroken to see me leave home. I will miss hearing her voice.
What if I don’t make it back? What I never see my siblings—two sisters and a little brother—again? I am not ready to face the possibility of losing them. I’m a bundle of nerves. I always blamed my mother for not letting me continue my studies in our hometown, but right now, I am wishing she would stop me from getting on the road to Damascus. 
I wonder what fate has in store for me. Will it smile at me? For the first time in the two months since I started this diary, I’m writing it with a shaky hand and teary eyes. ♦

Marah
Editor’s note: Marah has been staying with family in Damascus for the past few weeks, where she went to take her baccalaureate. Before she left, her editors at Syria Deeply banked some diary entries to run during her absence; this is one of those entries. We look forward to her return to this space and we assure you that she is safe and sound!
Everything in this new world is unfamiliar. So many of the people I have known and loved are now gone, and now I’m alone, struggling to find my way. My father, my grandfather, and my grandmother were snatched away. I remember my favorite uncle—I looked forward so fervently to his visits. He was hit by a mortar shell and died. I miss him.
My extended family used to gather at our house. That was before the war. I don’t see them anymore. Everyone’s gone; our city looks like a ghost town. Both of my aunts fled as soon as the bombing started—one now lives in Egypt, the other in Turkey. Most of my uncles managed to make their way to Libya. Another one went to Lebanon. The last one is still here. We were once a family, but we’ve been splintered into so many fragments that it would be impossible to reassemble us into a whole. 
I grew up in a different neighborhood than where we live now. I used to play with our neighbors’ kids. Those kids are gone now too. Sometimes I miss them so much that I find myself walking down our old street, only to return home sobbing. 
I miss everyone. I often call my cousin, who used to be my confidante, and my friend Hanin. I’m attached to the phone—it is my salvation from the darkness that shrouds my city. But hearing people’s voices doesn’t satisfy my yearning to see them in front of me. And the phone can’t put me in touch with those who are gone forever. 
Those who have stuck around here are permanently scarred. My uncle is present, but distant. My friends are so consumed with their own sadness that it’s hard to reach them anymore—we’ve lost our closeness. I am terribly lonely. I fluctuate between love for everyone and hatred for the ones who left to lead better lives elsewhere. It hurts to think about the latter group—they remind me of my past, the grand life that I loved, that I still love, but that is painful to remember. The present is only darkness and a relentless, unforgiving unfamiliarity. ♦

Marah
I had my first encounter with love at the age of 15. I was walking to school when I suddenly got the sense that I was being followed. I turned around and saw a boy who used to live near my house. He was tall, dark, and handsome, with big eyes. He was dressed beautifully. He wasn’t like any of the other guys I had seen around.
It took him a while to gather the courage to approach me, but one day he came up to me at school and asked if he might have five minutes of my time. He told me he liked me and wanted to be friends. I wanted to get to know him, too, but in that moment I got shy and said no. He looked crestfallen, but accepted my answer.
That night, in bed, I couldn’t believe what I’d done. Why did I say that? Why did my shyness make me act so absurdly? I wondered if I’d lost my chance forever, or if he’d try to talk to me again. Next time I wouldn’t be so nervous. If he asked for my friendship, I would give it. 
The very next day, that boy called me on my cell. I’m not sure who gave him my number, but I was glad they did, because we talked for over an hour. That’s when our friendship began. After that, we talked on the phone often, but in school, we ignored each other. We didn’t want people to realize what we were beginning to: that our friendship was becoming our first love.
When Syria’s war began three years ago, the boy decided to fight with the opposition. Before he left our city, he asked me to meet him at the library. There, he told me he’d be gone for two months of training. I cried a lot. His hand reached for my face and settled on my cheek. Our first physical contact! I blushed.
I didn’t hear from him for two months. I was a teenager in love in a time of conflict; I was scared for him and yearned for him. Then he returned and we met once again at the library. We ran to each other and grabbed hands. He wanted to hug me, but I refused—I am from a conservative family and was brought up with strong religious values that prevented me from being physically affectionate with him in public.
We sat in the library for a long time, talking about our present and our future. He said he was going to fight on the front lines in the morning. I begged him not to go, but he had made up his mind. 
I got the news the next day that he had been killed. At first, I couldn’t believe it. I cried so much I thought I would die. My mother, who knew nothing of our romance, could tell something was wrong. I finally told her the whole story, regardless of how she would react. (She was not angry with me.) I couldn’t forgive myself for refusing to hug him the day before. I wished a thousand times that I had hugged him. I really did! My sadness was unbearable. That night I had a dream that he and I were together, walking in the rain.
It’s now been two years since my first love died. Don’t mock me, but my broken heart tells me that I will meet him again. ♦

Lilly
Last night I said to my mom, “I feel like all of my interests are conflicting with one another.”
She explained that while I’m into a lot of different things, they aren’t necessarily conflicting—it’s just that my stronger passions take precedence over the more “minor” ones.
A part of me knows she’s right, but, obstinate teenager that I am, I refuse to accept that there’s anything “minor” about any of my passions. My mom doesn’t think I should worry about any of this, but I worry about the future. I love science and feminism and sports, but eventually I’ll have to pick one, right? It would be awfully hard to double-major in astrophysics and gender studies, plus play on a Division I soccer team.
I’m in 10th grade, and sometimes I feel like, I still have two whole years of high school left! But other times, I’m like, I only have two years of high school left?! The latter thought hit me hard this spring. I was playing soccer and trying to keep my grades up and attempting to find time for everything else that I wanted to do. Once the school year ended, though, I switched from only to still. All these seemingly endless summer-vacation days give me time to give all my pastimes my full attentions.

In my city, guys and girls have undergone a radical change. Since the start of the uprisings, everything has changed: their opinions, their aspirations, the way they talk, their expressions and even the way they look.
We used to have great conversations. We loved music from the West as well as local stuff, and we would race to listen to the newest albums. We loved movies of all kinds, in all languages, especially comedies. We were interested in fashion and design. We were attracted to anything new. We lived a wonderful life. We made adolescent mistakes.
Now we have turned into old women and men. All we can talk about is food, electricity, water, firewood. There is no cellphone coverage and no television. We are deprived of our teenage pastimes.
Shopping used to be one of my favorite things to do. I loved going window-shopping with my friends after school and getting excited about a bright-colored purse or a shiny pair of shoes. Now we display that same level of excitement over rare treats like a piece of fruit. Can you believe it? We never expected this to happen.
We used to see the boys around school, carrying flowers and wrapped presents for their beloveds, wearing their nicest clothes. Their eyes were filled with love, happiness, hope. Now, the streets around the school are empty, and all the guys are out fighting on the front lines. When we happen to see them, their hair is shaggy and their shoes are dirty. Now they carry rifles instead of roses. If you look at their faces, all you see is worry and frustration.
Everything has turned upside down. Everyone is depressed. Sometimes we laugh and cry at the same time. How did this happen to us?
I feel sorry for myself and for all my fellow Syrian youth. I hope that our situation changes soon, so that our souls and dreams might reawaken. I’m afraid we will regret living through our teenage years without the normal teenage rites of passage. This is not how youth is meant to be lived. Will this war damage us for the rest of our lives? How will we make up for what we’ve lost? ♦

I write at least part of a poem every single day, and it’s made me feel as though I have regained a significant part of my soul. I see the world differently when I’m actively writing poetry; my brain feels more alive.
My poems are like a diary of my brain—they reflect whatever I’ve been thinking about that day. Lately I’ve been thinking about the Beat Generation and about Patti Smith; my recent poems are about Laura Palmer’s secret diary and drug addicts wandering through old New York City and people who have passed through my life.
I don’t know how I went so long without writing poetry, but I have new hope for the future. I feel like a writer again, and it’s one of the best feelings in the multiverse. 
Summer is close; I can feel the heat on my skin when my gym class goes outside to play football on the Astroturf. For once in my life, I feel kind of sad about school ending, but I also look forward to summer, to making it matter for once. I’m hoping to take a trip to San Diego with one of my best friends over the break. I cannot take another three consecutive months of New York.
But all is well. In fact, everything is really good. I feel weird saying that for some reason, but it is the truth. ♦
Marah
Family is a big word with a great meaning. Family, for me, used to mean grandparents, parents, uncles, aunts and siblings. Now my family is smaller. I only have my mom, my two sisters, and my little brother. Everyone else is far away.
I love to talk about my siblings. I’ll start with my sister Maya. She is one year younger than I am. We are very different, and we always fight. She’s studious and loves to read. She always has a book in her hand—at home, at school, even walking down the street. I think reading must be her escape from reality. Our circumstances haven’t stopped her from excelling at school. She’s up late every night, reading and studying by candlelight or with a flashlight. My mom asks her to take it easy because she fears for Maya’s eyesight.
Maya dreams of becoming a cardiologist, and I think that fits her, because she’s quiet and studious. But sometimes she speaks out. The day after our father was killed, she wrote a story about him that made everyone at school cry.
My youngest sister is very delicate. She resembles my mother in looks and personality. The conflict has affected her significantly. She is not doing well at school, and when our mom asks her to study, she cries and says that she can’t comprehend her lessons. She lives in her own world. Maybe it’s the world we had before the war. Our old, happy world. She’s very secretive and doesn’t like to open up. Even as a little girl, she refused to share her pain with anyone else. 
She is too attached to my mother. When Mom gets sick, my littlest sister sleeps next to her, holding her hand and crying. My sister is scared of losing her mother. Shedoes not ask Mom for anything, because she is fully aware of the stress our mother is under, but Mom never forgets about her little girl, and the extra love and compassion she shows her doesn’t annoy the rest of us, because we know that her childhood was stolen by the crisis. Mom never pressures her about school or grades—I think she empathizes with her daughter. This sister dreams of working in an orphanage or a nursing home, because she’s got a deep affection and tenderness for others.
Then there’s my brother, the youngest member of our family and the only boy. He received a tremendous amount of love and attention from our father, who could never say no to him. Mom says that our father spoiled him. When Dad was alive, my brother was an innocent, energetic child who did nothing but play all day long. Now he has to fill the water tank, chop wood for the fireplace, and run errands. He has taken on the burden of responsibility too early in his life.
Mom tries to encourage my brother to study, but he does not care to do so. He takes out a lot of his anger and frustration chopping wood. He is always outside. My mom can’t keep him inside the house because there is nothing to distract or entertain him—no TV, no internet. We all love my brother and care for him because, like us, he has lost everything—especially his male role model. He is only 12 years old. It’s too much for someone so young to bear.
We gather sometimes just to talk, laugh, and cry together. My mom supports us and tries to help us forget reality, but this conflict has changed us. It has also brought us closer together. We love each other now, and we will love each other forever. ♦

One of the best feelings in the world is finding out that someone that you have really, really liked for months feels the same way about you. One of my best friends and I are going out now, and even though it has only been a few days, I don’t think I’ve ever been happier. Her being in my life is literally the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I just want to hang out with her and give her mix CDs and crumple up all of the poems that I wrote during worse times. My life has become euphoric because of her existence in a space formerly occupied by final essays and exams and half-made plans for summer. I feel like I’m growing up, and, oddly enough, it isn’t terrifying.
There is so much I want to say about all of this that I don’t know how to take the time to express any of it eloquently—I just write everything that comes to mind. But I’m content at the moment just sharing everything. ♦

When I was around 10, I wrote in my diary that I’d never weigh more than my mom. She was skinny and narrow-shouldered and short, with bony elbows and prominent cheekbones. She ate gluten-free and exercised a lot and would often complain about her weight or her looks, and I would reassure her that she looked great.
I settled on a number, and I made a promise to myself, in writing, that my weight would never surpass it. But I was just a kid in middle school when I made that promise. I hadn’t hit puberty yet and I didn’t know that one day I’d grow tall and broad-shouldered and thick.
Between the ages of 12 and 13 I had bulimia, but I hid it so well that nobody knew. After a year of throwing up, I realized it wasn’t making me any skinnier, so I stopped. Then we moved to the States and food was everywhere, and I started gaining weight.
Candy was really what did it, and the CVS right around the corner that supplied it to me. My friend Owen and I would go and buy tons of candy and eat it day after day, and it wasn’t long before I hit my self-imposed maximum weight.
On and off, I stopped eating. I exercised compulsively even though I didn’t really know how to exercise. My “workout” consisted of stuff we did in gym class: jumping jacks, running up and down the stairs. I counted calories obsessively. I self-harmed when I thought I’d eaten too much.
I was diagnosed with EDNOS: Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. I thought that was what they called you when you weren’t skinny enough to be anorexic. I kept binging and starving and not talking to anyone about it. I wasn’t throwing up anymore, and I wasn’t losing weight. In fact, I kept getting bigger and bigger, until I couldn’t fit into my mom’s jeans anymore. I was heavy, bloated like a corpse, and covered in scars.
I hated my body for betraying me. Punishment was the only form of control that I felt I had over my it. 
I’ve never opened up about this as much as I am right now.
This week I had a psychotic or spiritual experience, I’m not sure which. I became unstuck from time, and I was a little child, and I was with my mother, and I was a chubby baby and she loved me anyway. And then I was old and unattractive, married to Peter, and we were still very much in love. That all lasted years, but in reality I was gone only 15 minutes. 
When I came back to the present, I realized that my life and my existence were even bigger than the seemingly huge numbers that I had let define me. I realized that the people who love me do so without taking my body into consideration. 
I understand now that my parents didn’t raise a body, and a body is not what Peter fell in love with. My body is a spaceship that my mind travels the universe in. My body is an avatar.
These epiphanies came all at once, and they did what no amount of therapy or hospitalization or pills could ever do. They made me truly accept myself, all at once, just like that. ♦

It’s foggy and starting to get warm. I’m craving caffeine; my hands are shaking slightly. They remind me of a girl I met once whose problems were much greater than mine. I travel in time and she is sitting beside me, and her hands are the ones in front of me, trembling.
“Look,” she says. “Look what they’re doing to me by keeping me here.” She was 16 and an alcoholic. She was also a heavy smoker, but they didn’t let her smoke, and they wouldn’t give her the patch. I met her when she was just starting to get withdrawal symptoms from the alcoholism.
I travel forward in time and realize that she is probably still out there somewhere. She probably made it—most do. I wonder if her hands still shake like that.
Peter is out west, visiting the college he’s almost certainly going to attend in the fall. I try not to miss him, because a few days is nothing compared to what it will be like when it’s months at a time.
I shake at the thought.
I’m already feeling withdrawal symptoms. ♦

Boxy hospital clothes.
“Why did you take the Advil?”
“Cramps.”
It smells like hand sanitizer. The generic hospital kind.
I think about David, the homeless man with all the cross necklaces around his neck, the same clothes and white hair every day, the limp and the twitch, the leathery hands that hand me what he thinks is the $2.47 in change to buy a large iced coffee with chocolate, caramel, mocha, and coconut shots, cream, and two sugars. 
He doesn’t hand me quite enough. I reach into my pocket and add what I find to the fistful of nickels. 
My co-workers hate him because he’s mentally unstable. They think he’s dangerous. But he’s never hurt anyone as far as any of us know. He comes in, says please and thank you, asks if he’s allowed to sit inside, and doesn’t bother anybody.
I get blood drawn a couple times and feel a little dizzy. I pee in a cup. Stickers are stuck all over my chest and legs and attached to wires that make a machine beep behind me. A blood pressure thing is put around my arm at least five times.
David doesn’t want to hurt anyone. He wants me to teach him about DDPerks and how to use a computer.
I just had some abdominal cramps. ♦

“In Webster’s terms, nirvana means freedom from pain, suffering and the external world, and that’s pretty close to my definition of punk rock.” —Kurt Cobain
Sunday was my first time in a moshpit. It was at a punk rock show, with band after band until 9 PM. I have never been part of something so expressive, so violent, so full of emotion, and I loved every second of it. The rawness was more than I had ever expected; every thrash and yell and fist breaking the air felt so primal. People were flinging themselves off the stage and the amplifiers. There was endless kicking and punching. The crowd was an amoeba, charged with motion. Being thrown around every few seconds and punched and drenched in flying drinks made me remember something that I had read once: Punk doesn’t discriminate.
I felt like my body was turning my emotions into energy. To an observer, it may have looked like a series of random acts of violence, but I could feel the meaning behind everything. It was a response to the music; it was a release.
Britney
I stare at the broken pieces of my Walkman in my hand, the small wires running into the indents of my palms. It was one of the few things I found pleasure in, that gave my time some kind of purpose, and I didn’t know until it was gone and a piece of me left with it. This is what becomes of almost everything in my life, material or otherwise.
The things I want are simple, but I can never have them for very long. I cannot ultimately live up to the unspoken standards of those I love. Things I love are always destroyed. And yet, masochistic as I know it is, I keep thinking that this new thing will last and guarding every spark of happiness, hoping it will grow before it’s snuffed out.
There are 10 more weeks of school. This should matter to me, I know it should, but I can’t find it in myself to care. I’m a prisoner in my jail cell of a body, awaiting a verdict from some unknown court. 
I don’t want to hurt anyone. All of the anger I’ve ever had has been sown by the outside world. I just want to write, and make music, and watch and listen to everything and everyone that I hold close to me. ♦

I settled on a number, and I made a promise to myself, in writing, that my weight would never surpass it. But I was just a kid in middle school when I made that promise. I hadn’t hit puberty yet and I didn’t know that one day I’d grow tall and broad-shouldered and thick.
Between the ages of 12 and 13 I had bulimia, but I hid it so well that nobody knew. After a year of throwing up, I realized it wasn’t making me any skinnier, so I stopped. Then we moved to the States and food was everywhere, and I started gaining weight.
Candy was really what did it, and the CVS right around the corner that supplied it to me. My friend Owen and I would go and buy tons of candy and eat it day after day, and it wasn’t long before I hit my self-imposed maximum weight.
On and off, I stopped eating. I exercised compulsively even though I didn’t really know how to exercise. My “workout” consisted of stuff we did in gym class: jumping jacks, running up and down the stairs. I counted calories obsessively. I self-harmed when I thought I’d eaten too much.
I was diagnosed with EDNOS: Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. I thought that was what they called you when you weren’t skinny enough to be anorexic. I kept binging and starving and not talking to anyone about it. I wasn’t throwing up anymore, and I wasn’t losing weight. In fact, I kept getting bigger and bigger, until I couldn’t fit into my mom’s jeans anymore. I was heavy, bloated like a corpse, and covered in scars.
I hated my body for betraying me. Punishment was the only form of control that I felt I had over my it. 
I’ve never opened up about this as much as I am right now.
This week I had a psychotic or spiritual experience, I’m not sure which. I became unstuck from time, and I was a little child, and I was with my mother, and I was a chubby baby and she loved me anyway. And then I was old and unattractive, married to Peter, and we were still very much in love. That all lasted years, but in reality I was gone only 15 minutes. 
When I came back to the present, I realized that my life and my existence were even bigger than the seemingly huge numbers that I had let define me. I realized that the people who love me do so without taking my body into consideration. 
I understand now that my parents didn’t raise a body, and a body is not what Peter fell in love with. My body is a spaceship that my mind travels the universe in. My body is an avatar.
These epiphanies came all at once, and they did what no amount of therapy or hospitalization or pills could ever do. They made me truly accept myself, all at once, just like that. ♦

It’s foggy and starting to get warm. I’m craving caffeine; my hands are shaking slightly. They remind me of a girl I met once whose problems were much greater than mine. I travel in time and she is sitting beside me, and her hands are the ones in front of me, trembling.
“Look,” she says. “Look what they’re doing to me by keeping me here.” She was 16 and an alcoholic. She was also a heavy smoker, but they didn’t let her smoke, and they wouldn’t give her the patch. I met her when she was just starting to get withdrawal symptoms from the alcoholism.
I travel forward in time and realize that she is probably still out there somewhere. She probably made it—most do. I wonder if her hands still shake like that.
Peter is out west, visiting the college he’s almost certainly going to attend in the fall. I try not to miss him, because a few days is nothing compared to what it will be like when it’s months at a time.
I shake at the thought.
I’m already feeling withdrawal symptoms. ♦

Boxy hospital clothes.
“Why did you take the Advil?”
“Cramps.”
It smells like hand sanitizer. The generic hospital kind.
I think about David, the homeless man with all the cross necklaces around his neck, the same clothes and white hair every day, the limp and the twitch, the leathery hands that hand me what he thinks is the $2.47 in change to buy a large iced coffee with chocolate, caramel, mocha, and coconut shots, cream, and two sugars. 
He doesn’t hand me quite enough. I reach into my pocket and add what I find to the fistful of nickels. 
My co-workers hate him because he’s mentally unstable. They think he’s dangerous. But he’s never hurt anyone as far as any of us know. He comes in, says please and thank you, asks if he’s allowed to sit inside, and doesn’t bother anybody.
I get blood drawn a couple times and feel a little dizzy. I pee in a cup. Stickers are stuck all over my chest and legs and attached to wires that make a machine beep behind me. A blood pressure thing is put around my arm at least five times.
David doesn’t want to hurt anyone. He wants me to teach him about DDPerks and how to use a computer.
I just had some abdominal cramps. ♦

“In Webster’s terms, nirvana means freedom from pain, suffering and the external world, and that’s pretty close to my definition of punk rock.” —Kurt Cobain
Sunday was my first time in a moshpit. It was at a punk rock show, with band after band until 9 PM. I have never been part of something so expressive, so violent, so full of emotion, and I loved every second of it. The rawness was more than I had ever expected; every thrash and yell and fist breaking the air felt so primal. People were flinging themselves off the stage and the amplifiers. There was endless kicking and punching. The crowd was an amoeba, charged with motion. Being thrown around every few seconds and punched and drenched in flying drinks made me remember something that I had read once: Punk doesn’t discriminate.
I felt like my body was turning my emotions into energy. To an observer, it may have looked like a series of random acts of violence, but I could feel the meaning behind everything. It was a response to the music; it was a release.

I stare at the broken pieces of my Walkman in my hand, the small wires running into the indents of my palms. It was one of the few things I found pleasure in, that gave my time some kind of purpose, and I didn’t know until it was gone and a piece of me left with it. This is what becomes of almost everything in my life, material or otherwise.
The things I want are simple, but I can never have them for very long. I cannot ultimately live up to the unspoken standards of those I love. Things I love are always destroyed. And yet, masochistic as I know it is, I keep thinking that this new thing will last and guarding every spark of happiness, hoping it will grow before it’s snuffed out.
There are 10 more weeks of school. This should matter to me, I know it should, but I can’t find it in myself to care. I’m a prisoner in my jail cell of a body, awaiting a verdict from some unknown court. 
I don’t want to hurt anyone. All of the anger I’ve ever had has been sown by the outside world. I just want to write, and make music, and watch and listen to everything and everyone that I hold close to me. ♦

Everything feels dull. I’m obligated to do so many things that I don’t want to do. I feel like I’m whining right now and I hate that but there is no other way to put it. I don’t want to be in this city right now; I am constantly stifled by the concrete, the mess, the guilt of having so many opportunities and wasting them.
The one thing I miss the most, the one thing that might help—even if only slightly—is writing. I write these diaries and I write for school. But I don’t write for myself anymore. I went from short stories to poems about myself to poems about others to nothing. I don’t even know where to start. I could write about myself again, but for some reason that feels selfish now, and I’ve forgotten how to craft lives of other people. 
I can’t tell if all of this is because I feel too much or because there is oblivion where so many of my emotions used to reside. I tell myself that it’s both, and I call it a day. ♦

But now that I’m older
My heart’s colder
And I can see that it’s a lie.
I’m in this weird place where Arcade Fire knows me better than anybody. Even though I’m 16, just a few months ago I would carefully arrange all my stuffed animals on my bed so as not to hurt any of their feelings. I still think of them by their names and have a sense of their distinct personalities.
When I walked home the other night, I pretended I was from a different planet, or a different time. I was full of fake wonder.
Real wonder is no longer part of my life. I’m not a child anymore. In a way, this is something I’ve always wanted, but now that I know I’m grown up, it’s sad. It happened too fast. I’m old and bitter.
At 16 I understand death better than I hoped I ever would. I understand grief and pain more than I wish I did. I did months ago, too, but only now has the last bit of innocence managed to escape. The world looks almost completely dark.
Our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up.
I’ve gained weight and don’t have the body of a child anymore. I was skinny and boyish-looking less than a year ago.
My heart is darker now. For years it’s been hardening and now it’s finished. ♦

I was in a paper village. Its citizens were all paper, but of diverse origins: construction , wide-ruled, college-ruled, watercolor, printer. The trees were paper too, and, ironically, people cut them down to make paper on which they drew pictures of trees. Everything in the village was white. The buildings were flimsy and thin; you could see silhouettes through their walls of people moving slowly and deliberately, careful not to disturb anything.
I realized I had a lighter in my hand. It was red, not white—sure to signal danger to the villagers. I had no pockets or anywhere else to hide the lighter, so I used my fingernails to tear a gaping hole in my chest and shoved the lighter inside. I was in more pain than I could have ever imagined.
But then my wound started gushing red blood, and the villagers saw and recognized the danger. It wasn’t fire, but it dripped on the white paper and made everything all wrong.
No other dream has ever affected me like this. I doubt one ever will. I don’t even know why. I can’t stop thinking about it. I doubt I ever will. ♦

I pulled my visor over my head and tied my hair into a high ponytail. I glanced in the little mirror in the car and got out, dusting off my apron. I was ready for my first day at my first job ever (besides Rookie, of course), working the register at Dunkin’ Donuts.
I was introduced to three girls in their early 20s. One of them, a skinny redhead, told me she would be my trainer.
“My boyfriend’s over there,” she said. “His name is James.” I would hear a whole lot about James.
“So, what do you do for fun?” said another girl. She didn’t look particularly interested in hearing my answer; she was probably told by the manager to make me feel welcome or something.
“Um, I like music a lot. And I play Dungeons & Dragons.”
“Oh wow, tell me more.” 
Not picking up on her sarcasm, I started to tell her about my character: Cora, Elvin Vampire, Level 6 Rogue. I saw her eyes glaze over and, suddenly realizing my mistake, walked away as quickly as I could.
There was a lot of sitting around. The girls made themselves fancy flavored coffees and ate sandwiches and doughnuts and sat in the back room talking about their boyfriends. A girl came in, handed the redhead a stack of Avon magazines and a bag of samples, and scurried out the door.
“The manager sells Mary Kay, so we’re not allowed to buy Avon or look at the catalogs at work,” the redhead explained. “But she’s not here, so it’s whatever.”
The girl training me gave me a tour and was showing me how to use the cash register when a blond girl walked up to the counter.
“You’re going to have to spend some extra time on this one,” my trainer said. “She seems slow.” 
“Make every drink in front of me one time, without explaining it, and then put me in front on the busiest hour,” I told the redhead. She did as instructed.
And I totally owned. Soon I was slinging caramel lattes and Coolattas like a total pro. It felt sort of pathetic to find joy in working minimum wage at a fast food joint, but I like to be good at things, and if I’m good at this, I’ll enjoy it. ♦

I lay on my bed, black with new white sheets, and surveyed my half-clean room. I’d tried to change the theme to white, let some light in for once, hang lace from the windows. I hadn’t finished, though, and now I was on my back, staring up at the Nick Cave poster on my ceiling. We were wearing matching shirts—i hate every cop in this town! they read. He wore his because he hated cops; I wore mine because I loved him. Murder Ballads, the best album, was playing on the little CD player next to my bed.
And I kissed her goodbye
Said, “All beauty must die”
And I leant down and planted
a rose ’tween her teeth
This song was playing during one of the first days I spent with Peter. We were in a park, lying on the grass, and eventually I was lying on top of him as we talked and laughed and the mosquitoes landed on my back. The sun slowly fell behind the horizon and the sky was indigo. We went back to his car and I shoved the Nick Cave mix CD I made for him into the slot, and it began.
They call me the wild rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it, I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day
I stared at the poster and my eyes glazed over a little as they lost focus. Peter was in Vermont. I couldn’t let that be hard. Soon he’d be in New Mexico, learning about philosophy and literature and beauty. Soon I’d go months without seeing him. Days was nothing.
He would be my first man
And with a careful hand
He wiped at the tears
That run down my face
Maybe this would be easier if I had friends? But loneliness is, like… my thing. My forté. The only emotion I’m able to handle like a human being. But maybe I can’t anymore. I got too comfortable with having friends and then they were gone and soon he will be, too.
From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one
She stared in my eyes and smiled
For her lips were the color of the roses
That grew down the river, all bloody and wild
I went to our favorite coffee shop, ordered a vanilla chai, like every day. The only free spot was at a big table with a man and a woman.
“Do you mind if I sit here?” I said, putting my headphones down.
“Not at all,” said the man, who was drinking black coffee. He was probably 25. The woman had a round face and a tiny nose and dark hair. She was very pretty, and she stood up to go to the bathroom.
The man stared after her, and then at where she was sitting beside him.
After some quick small talk, he told me about her. She was about to leave town, he said, and they’d agreed to break up before she left—long-distance, they’d decided, would be too hard. “I’m in love with her,” he said. “She’s such a beautiful person.” He held his mug to his lips and downed the rest of the coffee like it was liquor.
“I’m in love with someone who’s leaving, too,” I said.
“Our lives suck, don’t they?”
“Yeah, I guess.”
“But at least we have them for now, right? That’s lucky.”
The woman came back and squeezed the man’s shoulder with a smile before she sat down. His face lit up so he was barely the same person. I could see how completely he’d thrown himself into her existence and how in his eyes, this woman was more important that anything else.
On the third day he took me to the river
He showed me the roses and we kissed
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word
As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist  ♦

We take videos of ourselves, preparing for the future. When we are in a beautiful place, the camera’s eye remembers it, and we speak to our future selves. 
I love you, even if we’re not together when you see this tape. 
I love you too, always.

I’m in Florida, on the beach, writing a short story about a cowardly knight and his fearless squire. There’s a blizzard at home that my friends are living in, and I’m drinking water that tastes like chlorine.
Two boys come up to me. 
“What are you reading?” they ask. I put on my best English accent.
“A Clockwork Orange.”
“Is it good?”
“It’s pretty fucked up. But yeah, it’s good.”
“What’s your name?”
“Viola,” I say. “I live in the mountains of Sapa, Vietnam.”
I tell them about my pet cobra and other lies. I tell them that nobody in my family is English, but that my parents faked the accent until I was seven so I’d pick it up.
I had control, and I was changing the worlds of these three teenagers. In their world, the girl on the beach with blue hair was Viola from Vietnam, with hundreds of adventures to tell.
I wasn’t Ruby, a girl on lots of medications who couldn’t handle public school, who’d lost most of her friends, who was bad at riding a bike, who had gained a lot of weight this year, who’d spent much more time in hospitals than in Sapa, Vietnam.
A weight was lifted. Lying is a beautiful art. It is acting and control and writing. It is more than saying you’re someone else. It is becoming whatever you wish to become. ♦

I woke up with a new idea.
I am bitter about my unhappiness. I am cynical and sarcastic and a little mean. I’m not evil, but I’m not a nice person. I don’t care about animals really, I don’t smile at strangers, I’m constantly irritable.
I jump from the couch. My friend L has been having panic attacks and a hard time in general at school, and sometimes he sneaks off to the public library to see me during the school day. So I write little notes—Have a great day, L! I love you! or I know this is tough, but be strong, you can do it!—and put cute little stickers on them, and stick them all throughout his books where he’ll find them.
That feels good.
It’s my friend’s birthday. I’ll make him a card. In fact, I’ll make everyone an unbirthday card about how great they are and how much I appreciate them. Handwritten and decorated cards, bursting with puns, have been passed around.
That feels really good.
I buy flowers and give them to strangers on the street, to my tutor, to my therapist, to the librarian.
I make biscuits from scratch as a thank-you for my boyfriend’s mother because she always lets me stay for dinner or stick around at night when I know how much she values family time. I write her a letter, too. I love your family. Thank you for giving me a home away from home.
I smile at people and listen to people talk. I try not to be as overbearing as I usually am, and be a good listener.
I make and decorate little cards that say things like You have a great smile, pass this on to someone else who has a great smile! In fact, I make about 30 variations, and pass them around. An endless cycle of pre-made compliments.
All of this feels so wholesome and I am beginning to love myself.
I love this.
I’ve found a key to happiness. Feeding off of that of others, like the most benevolent parasite. ♦

I just sent an email to my advisor asking for the code I need to register for a January class. Most students take the month off, but the school is still officially open, and you can elect go back early to make up some credits or work on an individual project. I want to go back early to avoid being home, even if it means I have to take a random course and read Ayn Rand or some other torture.
Being home has been nice in a lot of ways. I got to hang out with my brother and our baby cousin (the only acceptable baby in the world). I’ve gone to the movies, driven my car around, taken advantage of having food around 24/7, and watched a lot of TV. But I need to leave. Here’s why.
1. My mom is treating me like a child/idiot. I went out to dinner with her one of the first nights I was here, and when we were done eating and I started to ask the waitress for a box for the rest of my food, my mom cut me off and asked for one on my behalf. Then she smiled at me and said, super condescendingly, “I know that’s hard for you.” O. M. G. Like, I know she’s trying to be sensitive to the fact that I hate being in public, but I haven’t had significant difficulty talking to restaurant staff since like 2008. Yes, sometimes I panic and want help doing stuff like that, but I usually ask for it when I need it. Plus, if she truly cared about my fear of interacting with strangers, she would have ordered for me at the beginning of the meal, right? There’s an episode of Sex and the City where Carrie brings Miranda bagels to be “a good friend,” but she forgets the cream cheese. Miranda calls her out on this, because it’s evident that Carrie just wanted to come over to talk about her own recent breakup, or else she would have remembered the cream cheese. My mom wanted to be helpful, but it seems like she really just wanted to demonstrate that she “understands” me, without actually doing the work of understanding me.
2. The way my mom is treating me reminds me of how angry she’d get whenever I wanted to stay home from Sunday school or social gatherings. She used to talk about how sin and doubt were signs of the devil’s influence. 
I remember all of the things my family and friends took it upon themselves to diagnose me with: anxiety, depression, Asperger’s, ADD. It made me feel defective, like I was born spoiled the way food can be spoiled in the making. I imagined a black tumor rapidly growing inside me, representing whatever made me feel afraid of and distant from others.
I used to picture myself at the bottom of a series of dark, labyrinthine subterranean tunnels that glowed red and emitted red flames. I imagined that God had left me there, and that the only ways out were to be morally pure and to socialize, or to reject God and his “plan” for me outright, whereupon I could find happiness in this life but would be condemned to spend my afterlife in hell, which terrified me. I thought that I might one day write about all of this, and that the second option would make for better writing.
I think I came up with the labyrinth in fourth grade. My friend and I got into a series of books called Daughters of the Moon. It was about teenage girls who had magic powers because they were secretly goddesses. We copied the moon-shaped necklaces they wore with yarn and tinfoil, called each other Serena and Vanessa after two of the main characters, and pretended to be them at recess. When we wrote down the names of these books for a class reading competition, our teacher was alarmed. When she learned that they included witchcraft and—worse—sex, she contacted our parents.
I remember crying as my mom yelled at me that night. I remember not knowing what about those books she was so afraid of but figuring it out later. At the end of our talk, she held up the second book, Into Cold Fire, and asked me what color it was. The cover was red. “Do you know what that is?” she asked. I didn’t answer. “It’s the color of the Devil. This girl”—she pointed to the girl on the cover, who happened to be Serena, the character I pretended to be—“is the devil.”
This incident is really, really, really funny to me now because it’s really, really, realllllyyy funny, but it was horrifying to me then because it confirmed all of my fears about myself: that I was unfit for society and also morally bad, condemned to hell. It also set the template for how I would think about sex once I found out what it was: as a dark ritual that your soul would be punished for engaging in. It’s taken years for me to release my self-image from the grip of these ideas. They made me so miserable for so long.
I know that I have some social anxiety and a disposition that favors observation over participation, but I also have the ability to work through my anxieties and confidence so that it’s possible for me to be with other people, because there is no tumorous mass of evil within me. Being home makes me remember how I used to feel. Being at school means I can continue progressing.
3. The mundane here is worse than the mundane there. Saturday night at dinner my mom recounted a hilarious story that a woman from my grandmother’s nursing home had told her at the home’s Christmas party. The woman listed everything she’d made for Christmas breakfast the year before. She’d made a bunch of really good food, but when she sat down to eat, she realized she’d forgotten to make eggs. My mom repeated the “zinger” (SHE FORGOT TO MAKE THE EGGS) and laughed, and my dad laughed his fake laugh. 
At school, there is much that is mundane and plenty of false laughter, but I would rather listen to an infinite number of people talking about studying than hear this kind of story again. If I’m going to be frustrated and bored in any capacity, I would rather do it there, where there are people I like and where even the boring things at least have a point. ♦

I was sick last week, but my family couldn’t tell. To them I acted the way I always do: sleeping often, keeping odd hours, and never leaving the house. I wanted to protest, to show them that is not who I am anymore, but moving around made me dizzy and my whole body felt heavy and ached. Except my hands. My hands felt OK.
The walls of my room seemed to sag and look sick. My bookcase looked troubled. My clothes slouched and draped around the room, looking sickly, their folds protruding like wrinkles in the flaccid skin of a corpse. I wanted to throw everything out. 
I woke up to a text from Mimi asking me if I would like to come over to her apartment for a sleepover. She said we’d have comfort food and watch the new episode of Downton Abbey. Did I want to come over? Duh.
By then I was feeling better, like I could pick up living the new me (ugh lol) where I left off. (The new me is the one who leaves the house frequently.) Mimi and I had soup and grilled cheese with wine and talked to my baby cousin over Mimi’s iPad. My cousin was eating dinner; she put berries on her fork, thrust it toward us, and waited to see if we’d accept her offer. She spends a lot of time eating an orange slice and laughing a lot. She says “I see you” and “Thank you, Mama.”
Outside, the weather was apocalyptic. The sky was red, cut through with wind and snow. Inside, it felt warm and glamorous. Mimi has a quality I have trouble describing, but it’s nice to be around. She thanked me for hanging out and told me she gets lonely, so she tries to stay distracted. 
I’m staying home instead of going to school this month, so I’m trying to stay distracted too. It’s not bad. We have fancy cable now and my dad really wants to see movies with me and I really want to hang out with my dad. We like to punch each other’s shoulders a lot. I missed that. ♦
Katherine
Hanging out with people more frequently means getting outside of my head and focusing on other people’s concerns, and realizing that “we’re all in this together” is true, and escaping the UGH of Big Life Questions (all good things), but it also increases my anxiety a million times over, and when the Big Life Questions come back (as they always do) they hit me extra hard. School is about to start again. I think my strategy this semester is to aim for Cs and to finish all my work. I don’t think I’ve ever finished all my school work since like 2010, and I think I can do it this year if I just aim low. ♦
Editor’s note: Katherine just turned 20, which means she no longer qualifies for the job of “teen diarist.” Don’t fret, though—she’s not leaving us! She’ll be writing other kinds of things for us from now on.

“Can you give me a kiss, Brisen?”
My baby cousin obliged, leaning forward and surprising me with a huge wet kiss on the mouth. A few days later I had a fever. I reassumed the habits of my younger self, the one who spent summers and breaks alone in my room like a sickly shut-in, although I was perfectly healthy. Now that I was genuinely ill, I was afraid people wouldn’t believe me, but I didn’t have the energy to perform my sickness as proof. I felt dizzy and weak. I had to remind myself that I’m not always like this. I am not what my parents (and I) think I am.
My grandmother and I recently took a road trip together to Florida. On our second day of driving, we stopped at a Texaco station. I stepped out of the car to stretch and was paralyzed by the hot humidity, the first real warmth I’d felt since September. A heron appeared in front of me like a figure from a dream, as if he had summoned his own existence in the flash of an eye. He looked dirty and cheap. In the gas-station-snack world he would be those barbecued pork rinds that are actually Styrofoam peanuts with powder on them. I was staring at him when my grandmother, not for the first time, said, “I want to teach you how to live dangerously.”
“Please do,” I said, but I wasn’t sure what she had in mind. Did she think I should be going out more? For the past few days I had accompanied her to everything she asked me to, and I always had fun. I asked her to do stuff with me, too, and I made sure I talked about the kinds of things I do at school. I felt like it was clear that I’m decently active, but I guess not?
She repeated her exhortation Sunday morning at brunch. I told her I didn’t know what more I could be doing. Did it have to do with parties and alcohol? I invited told her to visit me at Smith next year—she could hang out with me and my friends and see how we are. (This is the best fantasy life I’ve ever created.) She could “live dangerously” with us, I said, insinuating that there are stories I just can’t tell her, the way she has stories of nights out that she won’t go into detail about, even when I ask. There are definitely things I won’t tell Mimi, but they’re not the kinds of stories she’s looking for.
“I’ve been the wild card in certain groups,” I said.
“I just want to see you live more dangerously!” she said again, but, in her typical fashion, refused to go into detail.
Maybe she meant dating? I just turned 20, and I have never dated anyone. I have neither kissed nor been kissed. I have expressed interest in no one (and vice versa). I have flirted with very few people (and vice versa). I feel mutual attraction with very few people. I’ve had potentially delusional inklings that some of my friends’ parents have been attracted to my energy, and sometimes that feeling, real or imagined, was mutual. Having a boyfriend would help my case, but that’s not something that’s currently available to me. I wasn’t about to try to pick someone up on a weeklong trip to Florida with my grandmother—that would probably be too dangerous for her.
Should I have told her about my crushes? I hate talking about that stuff. It makes me feel like some large part of me is being ripped out of my body. “I have a crush on every boy,” I falsely moaned to my friends at sleepovers in middle school and early high school, to make them laugh and to get them to stop asking me about crushes. So I can’t tell Mimi about my crushes. Crushes are a safe space, a private space, and there’s something about them that makes me melancholy.
Should I have told her how once, in a darkened pizza parlor in Arizona, sated with pizza and drunk on the feeling of deep bonding that one can feel only after a week of camping, doing construction work, talking about God around campfires, and not showering, a boy turned to me when no one was looking, caught me wiping tomato sauce off my face, and said, “God, you’re so pretty. Like…gorgeous?” When I didn’t respond immediately, his expression dimmed and he said, “Did you know that?” And then I continued to not respond. I did not move or change my expression or make a noise. I just sat there and stared at him for a minute, then I stood up, walked slowly to the bathroom, and bent over the toilet to vomit. I didn’t end up puking, but I stayed in there for a long time, sure that I would.
I didn’t tell her this story, because although it might convey the kind of devil-may-care attitude she seems to be looking for, it would also show her that I am incapable of interacting with people, and therefore incapable of actually “living dangerously.”
My parents would probably agree with her. They think I’m a shut-in. And I am sometimes, but not always, not even most of the time, and on the whole it is not as pitiable and boring as they suggest, nor as tragic and final as I sometimes feel it is. It’s so many different things at different times.
This diary doesn’t help my case with my parents. But I determine what I write about here, so it’s my fault, really. This is the persona I so often choose to show the world. I hold it up and turn it this way and that in front of my peers like I’m on QVC showing off a gaudy ring. Depending on how the light catches it, it can look elegant, tragic, funny, inconsequential, pitiful, embarrassing, brilliant, dignified, dull. When I look at it in the privacy of my room, I can see how much of it is me and how much is a lie.
I think I live pretty dangerously now. I accept every invitation to hang out. I get out of my dorm room as much as possible. And since I read Charlotte Brontë’s novel Villette, I’ve been trying to avoid ending up like the main character, Lucy Snowe, a woman who finds herself stuck in isolating circumstances and habits.
God, Lucy Snowe! Has looking in a mirror ever made me feel as much like I would vomit everything in my body—all the food, viscera, bones, and deeper layers of skin, until I am paper-flaked to pieces—as this book did? Lucy’s story aligned with my reality in many ways, which scared me enough to convince me that I should change the way I live and how I experience, consider, and choose isolation. Lucy takes pride in being emotionally removed from things as they are happening, but she is uncomfortable being alone. I am trying to lessen the distance between myself and things that are happening around me. Lucy dresses in dark, plain clothing and suppresses her personality; I want to dress more distinctly and to be more social in general. Lucy tries to avoid interacting with people who are mean or thoughtless or who strongly disagree with her philosophies about life. I would like to be more open to getting to know all kinds of people, instead of giving up immediately when something doesn’t instantly click.
Mimi wants me to experience more danger, but I’ve always felt it everywhere. I’ve faced danger and acted despite it many times. I’ve tried out for plays and dance shows in high school. I go out a lot even though it’s often, if not emotionally grueling, at least incredibly distracting.
There have been times when I’ve lived less dangerously, and those have had their own rewards. Every day I’ve spent hiding has been as rich with drama as every day I have tried to connect with someone.
There was the drama of the dark and necromantic world I lived in when I was younger. The moral confusion and the fire-filled labyrinth I imagined as its metaphor.
The drama at the start of each new friendship, and at the end. My friendship with Chloe, my first friend at my new school, and still the one I am with most often. The drama of our difficulties, and the way friendship morphs into new good shapes and new bad shapes.
The drama of starting to have a close relationship with my brother. Of helping each other out.
The drama of deciding whether or not everything you feel is based on something you’ve imagined. Having my first crush at Smith in my French class and being unable to feel even the despairing kind of hope I generally use to torture myself, because that kind of hope hinges on possibility, and I thought she had a boyfriend. Feeling instead a different kind of hope that is a fevered knowledge of impossibility.
Discovering later that what she had was an ex-girlfriend, recently anointed. Getting lunch and overhearing her friend ask her how she felt about the breakup. Hearing her respond that she felt bad, but wouldn’t after this weekend. Feeling unsure if she looked at me when she said it or if her friend grinned slightly and knowingly when she noticed me watching them. Being unable to read her body language because her movements were too slight to be certain. Experiencing a sublime feeling akin to being taken over by a fever when she tapped my ankle three times under the table when we were studying together later that day, because I think the second and third tap maybe lingered. Changing my position to check. Being unable to concentrate all afternoon and for days after, feeling feverish while reanalyzing our interactions and wishing I had risked embarrassment and said something, lived more dangerously. Beating myself up for everything I had said around her, and for everything I hadn’t said. For missing chances to ask her the questions I wanted to ask. For missing the opportunity to have any connection with this person. Later, I recited to myself: “I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed / And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane. / (I think I made you up inside my head.)” 
I think I made you up inside my head. There are so many experiences that I might have only imagined. So many aspects of my friendship with Chloe, so many looks from people, so much of many things. There’s a madness that comes with being often isolated and struggling to connect with others while also being incredibly naïve and exceptionally inexperienced.
I remember a scene from the French movie Fat Girl where, in sight of her sister and the dude her sister is flirting with, Anaïs swims back and forth between a pole holding up the diving platform at a pool and the pool’s ladder. When she reaches each one, she holds it and talks to it and kisses it like it’s her lover. What she tells these inanimate suitors is intelligent but naïve: “Women aren’t like bars of soap, you know. They don’t wear away. On the contrary, each lover brings them more, and you get all the benefit.” Then: “You make me sick. How can you disgust me and attract me so much?”
When I go to bed, I feel myself expand into the surrounding darkness and feel myself walking, moving, touching surfaces as I move about with people I love. Talking to them and using my hands to touch the words we’ve spoken.
I’m in Florida with Mimi, and I realize how much I love her. A great side effect of getting older has been being able to talk to her and having her share more with me. I have my brother. I have my dad. I have school and people I like there. 
I feel fine. I’m not bitter or overly tragic or any of the other things my family says I am after reading these entries. I’m just in limbo, swimming back and forth between my own two poles. I have, if not an early life lived dangerously, one in which I have keenly felt everything. In fact, I have had hundreds of real experiences. I’ll have more. ♦

I am happy. I’ve been happy before, but it’s never lasted this long. I’ve been happy for moments when someone’s sent me a message telling me they liked my writing, or while reading a happy book, or while huddling with my friends under a soft blanket. I’ve been happy for days when the leaves were crunchy and the world smelled like fire and earth.
But right now I am in love with another person who is also in love with me, and I am completely sure of that, and I want everyone in the world to know.
I want it to be announced to the world that he sings to the noisy instrumental parts of Sonic Youth and traces shapes on my arms when we’re next to each other. I want everyone to feel the way I do when I kiss him on the cheek and he smiles and it’s the most beautiful thing in the world. I want everyone to watch us singing “Space Oddity” in his car, and him catching me when I slip on the ice he made me walk on with him.
I trust him more than anything, and I don’t trust anyone easily. Why? 
He wears the reindeer sweater I gave him while I sit across from him at the coffee shop we always go to.
We pretend to be adults, a young married couple, and go to Cardi’s. We look at couches.
These things have transformed me. I am wearing colors. My hair is short. I am happy. ♦
