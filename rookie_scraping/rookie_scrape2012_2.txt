You guys. YOU GUYS. This weekend I made HISTORY (or herstory, LOL). Last week I was in a perpetual barf zone because I did none of the work I told myself I was going to do over Thanksgiving break. It piled up like the trash in that Shel Silverstein poem where that girl never takes out the trash, because she hates it, and the trash EATS HER or something. I mean, I think she just had to leave her house, but in my memory, the trash comes alive and has her for a snack.
Basically, my work this week ate me like I was a tube of Go-Gurt, slurping up my soul until none of it was left. I was running on little sleep, so when one teacher asked me a question during a presentation I was giving, I slipped and replied, “IDK.” QUELLE HORREUR! So, this weekend, even though all that is left of me is an empty yogurt container, I got to work. Friday night, instead of getting a burrito and watching the Christian Slater skateboard film I’ve been dying to see, I wrote a draft of a paper and caught up on reading. Fun! Saturday, instead of sleeping in and lounging about all day, I did some research at the library, finished my paper, and got some more homework done. If I’m not the coolest teen on the internet, WHO IS?!?!?
Don’t be fooled, I still spent a lot of time dancing to “Only Girl in the World” and lip-synching to “Crazy in Love,” but I basically denied myself fun in order to get work done. Also, don’t be fooled again: I still think I might puke because of final essays and exams, but with Beyoncé by my side and a newfound work ethic, I’m feeling a little more confident. Now excuse me while I go do some A+ work (read: curl up in a ball and cry). ♦

Saturday night my roommate invited me to dinner with her and her friends, and I was like yeah sure whatever and was totally chill. We ended up going to the school cafeteria (becuz muny) and ran into two of their other friends, whom we’ll call Stoner Dudes 1 and 2, waiting in line for their sandwiches. Stoner Dude 1 was saying, “Man, I was so baked last night. Like I was tripping. It was so crazy. We watched The Dark Side of Oz. It changed everything.” Then Stoner Dude 2 was like, “It totally changed my perception of that album! I thought it was just these jaded dudes, but it’s so much more playful.” They talked for a while longer, mostly repeating SD2’s insight about The Dark Side of the Moon being playful.
We got to the front of the line, and I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato. One of my roommate’s friends turned to me and squinted and pursed her lips like she was contemplating a weighty matter. “Uhhh, hey,” she said. “Do you, uh, smoke?” She said smoke like sm-OH-kuh and winked. 
“Like, smoke-smoke?” I asked before being all, “Yeahsuretotally.” 
“Cool” she said, nodding approvingly. 
So dinner was whatever and totally besides the point. (Not besides the point is that SD1 came up with the idea to heat up some brownies and smother them with ice cream.) We went back to the dorms and hung out in this one girl’s room for a long time. My roomie and her friends talked about getting weed and somewhere along the way I accidentally revealed that I thought that weed was super expensive, which I could immediately tell from their incredulous faces is probably not true. It was super awkward in light of the fact that we all now knew I had lied back at the cafeteria. Also terrible was when they talked about getting a handle and I was like, “A handle?” (I have since learned that it’s a half-gallon of alcohol.) Every time I open my mouth I announce to the world that I haven’t lived the quintessential “teenage experience.” Though I guess by “teenage experience” I just mean dating and weed and I’m pretty mad at myself for caring anyway.
I can’t help noticing that every time someone mentions drugs, alcohol, or sex in my presence, they apologize to me. Every single time. Even if they know me well enough to be aware that my attitude about all of that stuff is pretty relaxed. Do I just have an inherently prudish and judgmental face? Do I reek of innocence? Someone tell me, because I have no idea what’s going on.
Sometimes I wonder if my having gotten to this point in life without any experiences with dating or drugs means there’s something wrong with me. Like, if I had been capable of having any meaningful relationships in high school, I would’ve gotten high at least once by now, and I’d have a first-kiss story too, right? Ugh. I feel like I’m stuck being a Shoshanna, but I know there’s a Jessa in me waiting to get out and just be totally chill. 
I will never, ever be chill. ♦

When I was young, truths were absolute, and there were angels above my bed. I knew I had angels watching over me because my mom’s friend had made a cross-stitch with a poem about how there were four angels above every child’s bed, and the picture showed a little bear-angel on each side. (Since my bed was pushed up against the wall, I thought that I only had three angels watching over me. It made me sort of sad.) Anyway, now it takes more than a cross-stitch to make me feel like I’m in good company.
A lot of girls in my hall at college watch Disney movies. I know because I can hear Aladdin or The Aristocats or Mulan through the walls. This was a big thing in high school, too. Kids would go through the hallways singing “A Whole New World” all the time. Friends went through a phase where they’d have Disney movie marathons at sleepovers. It always bugged me. I don’t feel the same magic when I watch The Swan Princess as I did when I truly wanted to be Odette. I don’t want to be watching the same things I did when I was a child. I want to feel grown up. 
Sometimes I have these moments—they’re hard to describe, but it’s like suddenly there’s a yellow light around everyone, and for a moment I truly see how real everything is, and I panic. The yellow light disappears in an instant, and with it my awareness of total reality. I used to be able to forget about these flashes and move on, but then one day I wrote down what had happened, what I had seen and felt, right afterward, so I wouldn’t forget. I think maybe I usually live in a state of part reality, part illusion, and these moments are glimpses into a higher state of awareness. Maybe someday I will transition into that state permanently. Maybe then I will be able to understand everything better. Maybe it will drive me crazy, like Rimbaud’s drunken boat after it’s been out at sea for forever. I’d still want it. It seems unlikely, though. ♦

Christmas is simultaneously sort of OK and the absolute worst. It’s OK because there are presents and food and a few people I like but don’t get to see the rest of the 365 (I c u bro and cool aunt and uncle and bb cuz). Also, my mom hooked me up with some pine-scented potpourri, so that’s nice. It’s the worst because I’m confronted with all my greatest social anxieties—like going to the mall and talking to people.
I went to the mall the other day to do all of my Christmas shopping. That doesn’t stress me out, because I always wait until the last minute, but ohmygod the mall you guys. Young children ran rampant, screaming and crying or just being brats while waiting in line to see the mall Santa. And I wasn’t in a hurry or anything, but people at the mall do this thing where they walk muuccchh slower than they would anywhere else. Or maybe slow walkers like the mall? Idk but it’s kind of stressful because you start to feel like you’re following people. And that’s creepy. At the Gap, I knocked over (and broke) a display. I helped clean it up before running out as fast as I could. At another store, some Grinch-butt yelled at me for taking too much time paying at the cash register, and at yet another, I set off the alarms because a censor was still attached to something I had bought. This things aren’t actually stressful or bad in and of themselves, but they made the stress I normally feel going out in public that much worse.
Thank goddess that is over, but now I face three back-to-back days of constant socialization. Some of it will be chill—going to my grandmother’s house on Christmas Eve is consistently the best—but the rest makes me nervous and grumpy. And when I’m grumpy, it’s hard for me to talk to people, which makes me nervous, which makes me very unpleasant to be around, which in turn makes me even grumpier. It’s a vicious circle—a vicious wreath, if you will.
I don’t know how I’m going to make it through all that. Maybe I can make a cardboard cut-out of myself that says things like “My grades are passing” or “That new Christmas sweater is really working for you” and send it to all these events in my place. (It will likely have better conversational skills than I.) Or maybe I can fake an eggnog-induced coma on Christmas day. But if anyone asks, you know nothing of this. ♦

There’s this episode of SpongeBob where Squidward uses a time machine, presumably to escape SpongeBob’s and Patrick’s antics. I don’t remember the episode very well, but somehow he ends up in some sort of parallel universe where he is surrounded by white nothingness. Every time he says something, a little speech bubble forms and floats into the air. Squidward interacts with this strange universe for a little bit before losing his mind and stomping his way out.
It’s truly horrifying. Also freaky! A lot of people have posted reverse or sped-up versions of it on YouTube, which I acknowledge isn’t legitimately frightening, but I will still probably fall asleep with my flashlight tonight. I’m legally an adult and am afraid of the dark and SpongeBob.
Squidward’s world of nothingness is how college feels to me right now. Like a white void. I’m not tied to much here. No dramas are unfolding, and I can’t list all of my classmates and give a description of each kid. Most of my interaction with people involves sitting at my computer or using my phone. 
Basically, if my life were a film right now, it would consist of me quietly going about my business—in my dorm studying or watching Netflix. Someone once told me it was good to be that way, because in being cut off from the world, you figure out who you are: your likes, dislikes, interests, etc. But that’s not true. You figure out those things when you’re exposed to other people’s shit and have to interact with a world that you don’t and can’t control. Because that challenges you. It makes you think critically about things. I mean, in high school that was mostly just talking to kids about the Kardashians or dubstep. But at least it pulled me out of the little world inside my head. (JK, high school sucked major balls.)
I guess I just feel weird this week because I feel like I don’t really have a clear sense of identity right now. I am like a cartoon character without the black borders. Maybe I’m used to relying on other people’s perceptions of me to define who I am. But also, maybe I’m sick of this void and need to stomp my way out and get back to Bikini Bottom, which is anywhere but my dorm room. ♦

I was in my dorm room, about to go out, when my mom called. I quickly put a few things in my backpack and drove to my house. My parents acted like it was really weird that I wanted to go to the hospital with them. They kept telling me that I could stay at school if I wanted. Mom said that my grandmother was supposed to die first, and that he was supposed to die on a sailboat. I couldn’t look into her eyes for long.
In the hospital, a nurse told us that my grandfather had had a massive stroke and that his eyes weren’t responding to light. His senses didn’t work; his mind was gone and it was just his body there, in bed, mouth open. The nurse said to keep talking to him anyway. She said you just don’t know. His legs kept jumping, throwing off the sheets; each time, the nurse and my aunt would cover them again. 
I was in the hallway of the ER and a nurse wheeled out a woman with the whitest hair. We stared at each other for a really long time. I went into the X-ray room to be alone. They moved my grandfather’s twitching body to a regular hospital room, where my mom and my grandmother answered all these questions about him and signed off on the form that said it was OK to not try to save him anymore. My aunt left and came back with a bag of peppermints. I didn’t want one, but I took one when she offered.
Then I was in the car with my father going back to my grandparents’ house. We were going to sleep for a few hours and then go back, but my mom came into the bedroom early in the morning, bent down, and hugged my father. I asked what time he had gone, and my father said 4:30 AM. I went back to sleep. I feel guilty about that. When I got up and walked into the living room, everyone was sitting around, saying nothing. My grandmother was there, looking very lost. She said they had been having such a nice day before it happened, and I said “I know,” because I did know, because she had been saying it all night.
Then I was back at school and I cried in front of a teacher and skipped some classes. My brother came back and we both were all “you’re real” because I guess it’s been since August since we’ve seen each other. 
Then I was at the visitation on Saturday and was hugging all these people I didn’t really know and talked to my cousins whom I hadn’t seen in a long time. One of our younger cousins eats bacon for every meal.
Then we were all in the church. My grandmother placed a rose on top of the box of his ashes when she went to take communion, and we walked out as everyone sang “Lift High the Cross.”
Now I’m at school. And I keep on thinking about how, in the hospital room, my grandmother had been asking where his glasses were and the nurse kept telling her that he didn’t need them anymore but she kept on asking until my mom held up the bag that held his things. And my grandfather was there but he already looked like a ghost. ♦
Katherine
I feel guilty right now, because my mom is really sad and I still have self-absorbed thoughts. Like whether or not the two kids from my old school that I bumped into Saturday night think I’m boring.
It’s weird that bad things happen, but there are furniture advertisements featuring a shirtless dude lying on a table with a slogan that says “We only put the best wood on our tables.” People have bad things happen to them and beautiful things happen to them, and there is still that video with two girls and a cup. People throw up. Isn’t that weird? There’s stuff all around us that doesn’t dignify humans or death or beauty. Nineties fashion was super tacky, but it was still called fashion. (Disclaimer: I have no sense of style, so the ’90s were just fine.)
At the same time, I like it this way, because I like cars and modern medicine and going to the movies in cars after I’ve taken Advil for my headache. I like microwaves and computers, and I like exploring the internet while I eat Bagel Bites. I think Bagel Bites are so delicious, but there is something off-putting about the freezer aisle in grocery stores.
I don’t know why I see the modern world this way. It’s gray and bleak and lit with fluorescent light. And somehow I find that undignified. I guess it’s just not what I want to give to my friends and family. They deserve something less clumsy, and that doesn’t smell like sewage and gasoline, even though I love the smell of gasoline. But people are clumsy and weird, and people like people. People like butts, even though butts poop and fart. And I like the modern world with all of its frozen-food aisles and dumb advertisements. And I find beauty there—even in the smell of gasoline—but sometimes it doesn’t feel right. Sometimes it doesn’t fit. ♦

I feel the worst I’ve felt in a while—like my innards have turned to sludge—and it’s not because of the massive amounts of junk food I eat (though that’s probably not helping). It’s because of school.
I hate my school so much that I wanna puke 24/7. It’s basically the same bullshit and atmosphere as my high school, except here I don’t even like my classes. I’m thinking of dropping out when this semester’s over. Seriously. I feel like if I stay here any longer, my soul will shrivel up into a raisin-like glob and I will hate everything forever. I know I said I was going to get a job a while ago and never did, but this week I typed up my résumé and made a list of places where I want to apply. Because if and when I drop out of college, I don’t want it to be some big tragedy. I want it to be empowering. I want to feel like I’m taking total advantage of the future that’s in front of me.
But I guess I have doubts about it still. It’s like in that Baudelaire poem where he goes, “This life is a hospital in which every patient is possessed with a desire to change his bed”—we’re always convinced that suffering over there would be so much better. I totally realize that dropping out and getting a job isn’t some incredible, glamorous alternative to suffering at MISERY UNIVERSITY. I’d have to move back in with my parents and work some hostess or retail job while many of my peers are off in different cities, living on their own, getting educated. 
But I do feel like I’m suffering in the wrong bed. This one is right by the window, which might be great for those who enjoy sunlight and don’t have sensitive skin, but I’m getting a harsh sunburn over here. That other bed over there, the one I’ve been eyeing, is too short for me, and my feet hang off the edge, but it’s far from the window and closer to the door. I feel like moving there would give me time to let my burns heal. 
Which bed I choose will determine what 2013 looks like for me. Meanwhile, I’ve registered for spring classes here and filled out the paperwork to stay, just in case. ♦

I’m doing this wrong, I think. I repeatedly put on my eyeliner and smudge some of it off, depending on what I think I’m doing wrong each time. Too thick. Too thin. Too dark. Too light. I look over at my roommate, also putting on her makeup. Her hair is slicked back into the most perfect bun ever, and she’s wearing red lipstick like a pro. When I wear red lipstick, I look like I just made out with a plate of spaghetti or drank a bunch of Kool-Aid. Even though my roommate is super sweet, I feel like she’s watching me and judging. She knows that I have no idea how to put on makeup. She has to know.
I walk to the cafeteria. My friend’s mom once told me that it was weird that my arms didn’t swing when I walked. Whenever I remember that, I try to make them swing more, but I feel like I overdo it. I see a big group of people approaching. Instead of stepping aside or just continuing to walk, letting them naturally make way for me, I take a deep breath and blitz through the center of the group, dodging people as necessary. I get a few weird looks. I definitely did that wrong.
In the cafeteria, I think about the writing club meeting I’m missing as I eat my grilled cheese. I stopped going because I was doing it all wrong. I was misunderstanding the prompts or ignoring them altogether or just writing down words that sounded cool together and that was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
The next day, I won’t speak in class because I read a Baudelaire poem as being super sexual, and the teacher didn’t read it that way. I was therefore wrong. When I get back to my dorm, I will try to begin a paper for my lit class, but I probably read Plath’s poems wrong, because I can’t read Baudelaire right. So I stare at my screen and panic so much that I have to take a walk around campus while listening to music to calm myself down. On the walk, I think about how I’m doing college all wrong. I don’t have plans for the weekend or for fall break or for anything, really. I’m supposed to be getting wasted all the time! Instead, I’m just doing random shit—going to shows, going to the downtown library to read in the courtyard, getting french fries late at night and driving nowhere in particular. I’m still in the city I grew up in, and that is a clear sign that I am doing this all wrong.
My life is all wrong. Everything I do is wrong and OH MY GOD GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD, KATHERINE. ♦

I had written about a page of my in-class essay before I drew an X through it all and ripped it out of my notebook. I was in my freshman seminar class, and all I had to do was write a couple of paragraphs on what had resonated with me from a speech I had attended the week before. A guy had written a book that we were all required to read, and he spoke about football and the state of politics. I had listened attentively and had plenty of thoughts about it. But I just couldn’t figure out what I wanted to say.
I was the last one in the classroom, trying to get something down about whether citizens have the power to discourage things like hateful political ads that appeal to emotions rather than reason. I was just finishing up when the professor started to say, “Katherine, I know—” I interrupted her by apologizing and trying to explain that I was almost done. I started to write faster. She said that it wasn’t about that. I stopped writing.
She told me that I hardly ever spoke in class, but she wished that I would. She said she knew I had something to say—that she could see it in my eyes or something. She used the word “mischievous” at least once. Then she said, “You don’t think like they do.” 
I agree with a lot of things my classmates say, and I disagree sometimes too, but the only three times I’ve spoken up I talked about Riot Grrrl, a Billy Collins poem, and the brick wall/waterfall chant. But my teacher’s analysis made me uneasy. I might see one or two things differently, but I don’t have some alien way of thinking that will shock the world. 
After talking with her a few days later, I realize that she means I’m much more liberal than many of my classmates, and that she thought class discussion could be more interesting if someone offered a different viewpoint every once in a while. Her last statement made me worry that there was a great divide between me and the other students. I don’t want to feel this way.
This has happened before. In my senior year of high school, I had to take a religion class. The course was called Christian Dynamics, and discussion tended to be about students’ personal feelings about their faith, or about applying faith to real-world issues. I never spoke in class until my teacher approached me about it and told me that participation was part of the grade. So I started talking, often disagreeing with something we had read. This led to other kids trying to pick fights with me. One kid made it his mission to convert me. He asked me, multiple times, to get coffee with him to discuss God, and when I refused, he called me a bitch. Class became a place where I didn’t feel safe, and I don’t want to feel that way again.
So now I’m afraid, even more so because I’m in a new place, and there’s a fragility that comes with that. It’s wrong to be quiet because you want to be agreeable. I think I’ll talk in class more next time, but I’m still scared. I think this will be an issue for me for a long time. ♦

I just wanted to get my laundry. I slumped out to the elevator at 1:30 AM and waited in front of a group of people hanging out in the chairs in the lobby on my floor. The doors of the elevator opened to reveal three people sitting on a cart. Two girls, one guy. All completely slap-happy. They talked some nonsense that went like, “OMG COLLEGE WE’RE UP LATE ON A SCHOOLNIGHT.” They laughed and laughed and laughed. We’re loud. Ha ha. We’re so crazy ha ha ha ha ha ha. Two of them proclaimed themselves king and queen of the elevator, the third a princess. I was their servant. “PUSH THE BUTTON FOR THE FIFTH FLOOR, PEASANT,” they yelled at me before I got out. Ha.
I gathered up my clean clothes in the sauna that my dorm has tried to disguise as a laundry room and went back to the elevator. I paused. Hearing the maniacal laughter of their majesties, I turned tail and took the stairs.
It was six flights up to my floor, and by the time I got to the top, I was exhausted and wheezing. I made eye contact with a guy sitting by the elevator, who must’ve been a witness to my torment. He smiled. Getting it, I laughed. “She took the stairs,” he said, giggling. I shrugged and said sorry before hurrying back to my room. 
I didn’t dislike the kids who tormented me in the elevator. I don’t even know them. But sometimes you just want some peace.
Friday night I finally got that. I packed up all my shit and headed over to my house—by which I mean my parents’ house. Getting home took about 10 minutes because I got stuck at every traffic light and passed road work. My parents were gone until Saturday, so I would be queen of my own castle for the night. I don’t want to brag, but I do staying at home right. I blared music and lip-synced like my life depended on it and sat on the floor eating pizza and cookies that I made. I covered my face with glitter and tried to figure out how to get the channel that was showing a program called The Dark Side of Dolphins. I drank milk straight from the carton. Being home alone is what I do best. And yet, I felt like an intruder the whole time. I felt weird, like the walls were whispering to me to tell me that I didn’t belong there anymore. I tried to fight them by occupying every room at some point and by generally making a mess, but nothing worked.
Later that night, I went up to my bedroom for the first time since I left for college. I thought that would feel right, but it felt empty and alien. I got in bed and cried until I fell asleep. I dreamed that I was back at my old school again, and woke up more upset than before. It was like every emotion I ever experienced in high school was attacking me all at once. I felt like shit and didn’t know how to stop it.
This is stupid, but I dug up this old throw pillow my mom gave me when I was little and had sleep anxiety. She told me it would absorb all of my nightmares, like a dream-catcher. I sat on my bed and clutched the pillow until I felt better. I tried to let it soak up all of my anxieties. It doesn’t really work anymore. ♦

The party is over. The balloons have long since popped, and there are no more Cheetos left in the decorative bowls. I’m lying on the floor, surrounded by streamers and eating candy from one of the leftover gift bags. The furniture is looking a little worse for the wear: there’s a giant punch stain on the carpet and a broken vase in the corner. I’m contemplating cleaning up, but I’m going to remain on the floor eating the candy a little while longer, because cleaning is difficult and the party was a TOTAL RAGER. 
I’m talking about my PITY PARTY, which has been going on for several weeks now. I mean, it’s been going on for the past 18 years, but it’s just recently started serving alcohol and blaring house music. I’m stopping this now, because it is unhealthy and gross. 
Since my workload this semester isn’t crippling, and since I’m dying of boredom, I’m going to try to find something to do. It’s going to be kind of a challenge. In high school, I had theater, dance, and school newspaper. At college, those things are mostly for the people who major in them (except the newspaper, which is just lame). 
Challenges are good, though. I’m going to keep on casually asking upperclassmen what there is to do here, but I’m also going to look outside of my school. If I don’t like it here, then the most logical thing to do is to find something not related to it whatsoever. I’m going to a job fair with a girl from one of my music classes, and I am currently searching Craigslist for jobs or internships.
Being in a rut is exhausting. I’m tired of being a completely self-involved brat who whines all the time. I’m going to clean myself off and step into the sunshine.

I’m always telling myself to stop talking. You’re an idiot, I think. You don’t know the basic principles of Marxism. You have a poor grasp of history. You haven’t read enough classic literature and you can’t pronounce half of the words you’ve read. I tell myself this, and yet I’m talking here more than I usually talk. It’s making me very frustrated and very uncomfortable.
I’m talking way too much in class. I should probably tell you that this means I talk about once a day, but that is way too much for me. Every time I speak I die a little inside, because I say something stupid or incoherent, or am unable to respond to a teacher’s follow-up question.
I was a blubbering idiot in French class the other day. Our teacher brought up Disney movies and told us to discuss how the patriarchy influenced the main characters, and I couldn’t stop arguing with this one girl. My grammar was poor and I kept throwing in English words because I didn’t have the vocabulary to say what I wanted to say, but I could not stop talking. I hated myself for that. 
The day before, our English class was discussing The Great Gatsby. As people made their points, the professor was writing them on the board. I raised my hand and opened my mouth, but all the ideas that were so clear in my head and my notes came out as an incoherent mess. After I was done, the teacher didn’t write anything on the board. I swore I’d never speak again.
I’m still not talking in my first-year seminar class—the one where my teacher told me I needed to speak up more. But I can’t—I’m too nervous. If I spoke, my teacher would know I’m an inarticulate fool and be disappointed.
I don’t want to feel nervous about speaking in class anymore. I’m trying to use each time I speak as an opportunity for growth, but usually I just beat myself up afterward and feel like I’ll never be able to do it again. 
This entry reads a little bit peculiarly to me. I feel weird. I feel dark and lonely and large and melancholy and very nervous. I’m having trouble saying what I want to say here the same way I have trouble expressing myself in my classes. I don’t want to feel this way anymore. I want to feel clear-headed and be articulate, but I think it’s going to take me a long time to get there. It’s going to take more writing and a lot more speaking and generally more living to get there. ♦

The first of September felt like a new month ought to feel. I sensed a renewal when I rose from bed, I moved around the house with a different air, and I knew, from having reflected in my bedroom in the days before, that something had to be done. My room had began to feel stuffy, like it was storing all of my spring and summer memories when I was suddenly ready to leave those behind. It’s the week I finally begin my new school, after all. I began with my bedroom wall:

My wall is a collection I started years ago, and I’ve added and taken away from it, but it was beginning to feel stale. I was too used to it. There were leftovers from a bad winter three years ago when I only listened to the Beatles, and my brother bought me an Abbey Road poster, an Australian flag, and a Lykke Li poster that he had stolen for me. There were postcards and mementos from old holidays, and a bad photo of me and my friend Claire dressed up, 1940s-style. I love all these things and more, but I needed a fresh wall to reflect the seasonal change (and my change).

Panic attack!!! But seriously, I felt like my whole life could fit on my bed:

I suppose I started my wall out of comfort, and taking it down was a bit like abandoning a safety blanket. It’s been there for such a long time, and my bedroom is such an Eden for me that any change at all can be disconcerting. But I completely deconstructed it, and peeling off those symbols of different parts of my personality and life felt cleansing. 

Now it is a work in progress. My Bruce poster was the first to go up again, obviously, as well as various postcards from visits to galleries, plus Mo Farah, who was my hero after the Olympics. But I also have room for it to grow all over again. September feels fresher than the new year. ♦

Everything could be all right, maybe.
Last week I was freaking out because I didn’t know who Proust was, and I missed a whole day of classes. Every time I tried to sleep, every single stupid thing I’d said to any single person came back to me and made me cringe. I wondered endlessly what the people I had said those things to thought of me. I filled page after page of my diary with letters to Christopher Owens and listened to “Vomit” on repeat. Because that is what I do when I feel isolated and dumb. 
I’m so fucking glad to be rid of that week. Everything is getting better. The literature class that I was worried about is my favorite class now. Discussions are laid back and easy to participate in, and the works we’re reading are interesting. Without this class, I’d die of boredom. It would slowly infect my mind and cause me to drool and write things like “live, laugh, love” all over my notebooks. In one of my classes, our homework for each night is to do things like give a definition of simile and metaphor or read one or two poems for the next class. Seriously? I got out of high school ready to take on the world—and now I’m defining simile for a class?! When does college start?
I’ve realized that I’m going to do just fine in my classes. In fact, I’m sure of that. What I’m not sure of is myself, and my ability to not make an ass out of myself to everyone I talk to. I’ll probably always be hard on myself. On one hand, it helps me learn. On the other, it makes me feel like a walking heap of dung.
Also, I joined a writing club. I was going to do school newspaper instead, but they mostly just write articles about student drug busts and how kids these days are scum who download music illegally. The club meets in a basement classroom in the building right next to mine. You get there by walking through an alley and going in a back door that was hard for me to find the first time I went. I like to pretend that it’s like the Room of Requirement or the headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix and I’m going to a DA meeting or something. The group is really small and eclectic. There’s a bro and a philosophy professor and a girl who’s really intimidating and no-nonsense. We use a prompt (just a random idea to get you writing) and write for 45 minutes. After that, you can share what you wrote. I haven’t shared yet. I usually misunderstand the prompt and write something strange. Then, I write something that’s actually a response, which, of course, I end up hating. Then I write something totally off topic. And then I’m too scared to read it. 
It might be a week or so before I can share my writing. I’ve already gotten over my fears of eating in the cafeteria alone, of just sitting next to someone instead of on the opposite side of the room, and of speaking up in class. It took every ounce of strength for me to even go to the first writing-club meeting. I stood, hand on my door handle and completely ready to go, for at least 15 minutes before actually heading out. I told myself that I was sick, that I should have left a few minutes before and certainly couldn’t go now. 
I got to the meeting five minutes late. I said something stupid and banal when I introduced myself. I misunderstood the first prompt they gave us.
The bro wrote something brilliant about Kennedy and the carpet of our room. A kid from my lit class recognized me and talked to me. I had fun sitting there and scribbling in my notebook, listening to others do the same. I’m going back for the third time this week.
So I have something I like, my classes aren’t terrible, and I’m becoming more self-assured. I’m going to be OK. I don’t have clean underwear for tomorrow, but that’s all right, too. Not in a ceramic-plate-someone’s-mom-has-that-says-“Every little thing is going to be all right” kind of way, but in an I’m-going-to-do-my-laundry-tomorrow kind of way. ♦

Adults are weird and illogical. They wear fanny packs and ask you what you’re eating even when it’s really evident that you’re eating crackers or a grilled cheese sandwich. They always want to know if you’re dating anyone, and they act surprised when they got caught in rush hour traffic even if they’ve been driving for over half their lives. They think 2 AM is really late and say “you’re welcome” when you thank them for a compliment. They even iron their clothes!
They also tell you things like, “Someday, the things you’re worried about now will seem so silly.” The first time I remember being told that was in sixth grade. I was at the mall with my mom to shop for school clothes. As we were walking past the makeup counters, I asked my mom if she thought that kids would like me if I wore lip gloss. “I don’t know,” she said. Later that afternoon, she told me that the things that felt like a big deal now wouldn’t feel like a big deal later. 
The lip gloss turned out to not be a big deal. I never wore makeup that year and was just fine. I spent my weeks studying and my weekends with my friends. We had giant sleepovers where we would eat Cheetos and ice cream for dinner and do karaoke to Hannah Montana songs, even though we always talked about how much we hated her at school.
Still, I don’t think that worrying about lip gloss at the mall was silly or stupid. I was always wondering how my life would be different if I looked like the pretty girls. They wore Nike Shocks, white thermal shirts under baby blue polos, ribbons in their hair, and lip gloss. They made a point to twist and turn their legs so that their calves caught the light just right. Nike Shocks were too expensive for me, and I never put a ribbon in my hair because I needed it to cover my hideous face, which at one point that year had fungus on it from ringworm. Like every other person ever, I felt like shit about how I looked and compared myself endlessly with these other girls. I felt that I was somehow less valuable than they were. Less special. It made me timid. It wasn’t the end of the world, but it didn’t feel good.
I felt like shit about every other thing about myself. I was too ugly, too stupid, too incompetent at theater and sports and math. I hated myself for never speaking in class, and hated myself if I spoke in class. I fought with my brother all the time and felt like shit about that, too. I thought my parents hated me. I sat in my room crying and reading all of the time.
Some of those things aren’t a big deal to me anymore. I’m glad I didn’t wear lip gloss, and I’m glad I wore my favorite chunky orange sweater every day instead of something that I wore just because the pretty girls did. And I know now that some of my concerns were extremely shallow. Many of them do seem silly now, but they weren’t to me then. And here’s the thing: I had to worry about them then in order to not care about them now. Having to overcome these things in order to learn and progress, and the incredible difficulty involved in overcoming them, makes those things a really big deal.
I keep on telling myself that everything that’s getting me down now will seem stupid in the future. But that thought doesn’t reassure or encourage me. I usually end up telling myself, This is going to seem stupid in a year, and yet you can’t get over it. You are stupid and worthless and incapable. And the fact that you think that means you are shallow, too, because the problems you have aren’t even that big.
Instead I’m gonna try to tell myself the truth: Everything feels like it has this incredible weight right now, and it does. If you’re going to get over any of it, you’re going to have to work very hard, or else get very lucky and have others help you. Everything you do right now is important, even if it seems dumb later. Getting to “dumb” is hard work. ♦

On Thursday I went to a concert that Thee Oh Sees and Ty Segall were headlining. It was in this bike shop, and it lasted seven hours. For the first hour, I felt like the girl who went to the prom alone. In between acts, I’d move from place to place in order to get out of someone’s way and avoid looking weird. I was observing. I observed the mom-ish looking figure sitting in the corner, and the people roaming around wearing denim jackets with patches that said “Rat Patrol.” They walked around like they owned the place. You were aware of their presence the whole time, like when you look in a mirror and all you see is the really red zit. I chose to watch them for most of the night. I had to know who they were.
I was standing in a miasma of smoke, and the place was cloaked in this amber light. It made me feel like everything around me was really beautiful, even though I felt out of place. After the first act, two guys told me I looked lonely and offered to buy me beer. “Cool, sure,” I said, brushing some of my hair back. Seeing the x’s on my hands, one of them said, “Ohhh, you’re a baybeeeee. Baby x’s on your baby hands.” They walked away. I spat on my palms and started scrubbing. I had three missions: look less out of place, talk to someone, and learn more about Rat Patrol.
A few minutes later, a girl came up to me and told me she liked my eyeliner. I made a comment about one of the opening bands. She laughed and said something about wanting to know what Rat Patrol was. She offered me a cigarette. At this point, I had accomplished two of my missions. Cigarettes are stupid and will kill you and have zero ability to make you cool or whatever, but having one gives you the ability to socialize and roam about more freely. They’re magic wands of camaraderie. 
We hung out some more, and I found out that she and this guy she was with went to my school. We swapped numbers. She told me that I should hang out with them Friday night: “Ohmygod. You have to meet my friend Kate. He’s, like, not even a real person. I’m going to text you, and you’re going to hang with us tomorrow night. I can’t believe I met you here. This is, like, destiny.” She then yelled “destiny” to the sky.
We stayed together for the rest of the night. In between acts, we smoked outside and talked about music, bad TV, and our school. And just because we were there and had a lighter, people would come talk to us.
She left before the last act, so I went and sat outside next to a bonfire. I looked around and saw those kids with the denim jackets. One of them said goodbye to his friends before riding away on a mutant bicycle that was twice his height. It must have felt like flying.
The people I met never texted me, but I don’t really care, because they didn’t owe me anything. I had a good time and figured out how not to be a mopey loser when I go out solo. It temporarily pulled me out of the funk I was in. Yeah, going alone was lame, but I think it’s good to just do things so you don’t drown in a pathetic pool of self-pity. And if I had the confidence to do this, maybe I have the courage to talk to the kids in my lit class whom I think are cool. ♦

I love the Olympics. It’s like a two-week Christmas that comes around only once every four years. It’s something to eat breakfast in front of, to watch while lacing up shoes and right before bed. 
The furthest back I can remember is Sydney 2000—I was young, but I remember how much I loved watching Ian Thorpe swimming (I still love Ian Thorpe). My family watched Matthew Pinsent win his fourth gold medal on a tiny TV in a Scottish B&B in 2004. In 2008, I was getting over jet lag after coming back from America and watched a ridiculous amount of Olympics coverage while trying to recover—that was when I really fell in love with the Games. It amazes me how much I’ve grown in the four years hence, and how much has changed for me. But this time it’s special (and surreal) because it’s at HOME.
Because this year’s Olympics are in Britain, it’s the first time I have felt an obligation to watch the opening ceremony from start to finish. I knew it would be great the minute I heard that Danny Boyle would be directing. But I didn’t know the Queen would say “Good evening, Mr. Bond” and my heart would leap over itself. I didn’t know I’d get so excited by lit-up trampoline beds spelling out NHS to celebrate our national health service—one of the things I am most proud of. I didn’t know I would swell with pride at our amazing music history and amazing music now—Dizzee Rascal and the Arctic Monkeys were such good live choices, while Paul McCartney actually managed to direct a whole Olympic stadium sing-song of “Hey Jude.” I didn’t know I’d get genuinely emotional when the Great Britain athletes trouped out last to the tune of David Bowie’s “Heroes.” Gosh, there are so many other things I could say I loved about it. It was British; it wasn’t too serious, it wasn’t trying to live up to Beijing’s spectacle, it did manage to reflect some of the best bits of this country, and it did involve the most amazing volunteers—normal people, who fitted in just as well as Shakespeare and Brunel and the Queen. 
Britain is my home. We have lived here, in my home, for four Olympics now. But next time we won’t be here. Dad will have most likely retired, and we’ll move out of the house that the church he works for owns. My brother will have finished university. Who knows where I’ll be the next time round. This has been on my mind lately. In four years’ time, I would like to be out of Birmingham. I would like to maybe be out of Britain. I could be anywhere, and the Olympics could be a touchstone for my nostalgia, and my support of Team GB may be my way to nurse homesickness. 
For now though, I am here. I can waste two weeks on the sofa. I can spend all my time watching crazy sports I’d never usually watch and having a novel patriotism play as constant background noise. I’ll be thinking about now and the future. This house and this country. I wish this house, this home, could always be here to come back to for the rest of my life. It won’t be, of course. But at least the Olympics will come back every four years, like clockwork. ♦

Mum and I had taken the car into town. It was busy and we had to go up and up the stacked car park to find a space. Once I’d slammed the door, I noticed we were high enough to see a snatch of the steely train tracks that lie below. A bright red Virgin train passed, sounding its horn―you know it’s such a sad sound. It evoked a lot more: I could also smell the train’s interior—a smell of magazines, of other people’s bitter coffee and bacon sandwiches. I could hear the pulsing of the tracks, feel that strange hunger from very early mornings when excitement and nerves make it hard to eat. 
Almost every year my family and I would take that train through green hills and rough towns, graffiti-covered walls and cold train stations up to Scotland―it would carry us halfway through our journey, just up to Glasgow, on our way to a remote island called Iona, in the same cluster of islands as the Mitford family island and the island where George Orwell wrote 1984 in complete solitude.
To feel that far away from everything, but still so utterly at home, is something I miss. That island was part of our routine; I knew it well, and yet every year it held new people and new experiences. My family is older now, and my brother and I have spun out in our own directions—so family holidays aren’t quite the same. Young families, out of necessity, become so tightly bound they become an entity, especially when traveling. I miss those times, and those journeys.
And it was the journey that made it. To take a plane and just arrive there—to not comprehend how far you’ve come, from Birmingham to Glasgow to Oban by train, to sea crossings and coach rides and a small boat and eventually to a spot on the white-sand beach where you could look out and there would be nothing until America—wouldn’t be the same. 
I stood there in the car park and let myself remember. There was a deep pang of something or other that resolved in pain and then faded to a strange comfort. It was comforting to know that that red train still existed. Those tracks still led somewhere, and that train still rode those tracks cutting through the country, not only in my imagination but right now. And on some unspecified day I would be on it again.

I don’t worry so much about Dad, because I think of him as the bravest in our family. He has a steely veneer, but also a humility he has arrived at by working in the church. Everybody asks for a piece of his attention, an airing of their worries, perhaps unaware that they are not the only one. Dad is the least selfish person I know. He’s had a lot of trouble with his eyes lately. Been to hospital countless times. He’s been home more than ever―having to position himself sideways on the sofa to keep an air bubble in his eye in the right place. We haven’t been able to relax into the summer—only into the sofa. Even if we had booked a holiday, we wouldn’t have been able to go. And so me and Dad sit in our places, in our house.

On one particularly bad day last year that I can only differentiate as the day I tried to meditate, I wrote Gandhi’s 10 fundamentals for changing the world in felt-tip pen on the end of my bed. I used to stare at the red “WITHOUT ACTION YOU AREN’T GOING ANYWHERE” in utter frustration. It mocked me when I was stuck―unable to go out, unable to eat, unable to sleep. The colours are fading now, and there has been action―good action―but I still don’t feel I am going anywhere. ♦

The end of summer is coming. I knew this would happen, and I am really feeling the Tame Impala song where “nothing ever changes,” but “everything is changing.” 
It’s the end of summer, of carelessness, when the exam results come out. Yet it’s also the beginning—the beginning of the next phase. I didn’t like my old school, so I left and did my own studies at home. I only went back to sit for the actual exams, and on the 16th, I’ll have to return for the last time to collect those results. The last LAST time. I want some kind of ceremony, someone to throw confetti over me as I leave, and a banner saying “Well Done for Surviving.” I am pretty sure, though, there will be no ceremony or celebration for me personally. No party invites, no big ideas, no huge sense of achievement. And that’s OK. I always feel like I haven’t achieved anything. But I have.
Now I am sort of “moving on” to a new place for my last year before university, a new building of education (otherwise known as school, but I don’t like that word). I’ll have to make big decisions about where to go next and whether I even want to go anywhere, decisions that I’ve been able to delay for a year. I feel like an elastic band stretched far, far away from all of that, but slowly moving back towards it. When the first day of the new term arrives, I feel I’ll be snapped right back into place. It might hurt.
I am glad I don’t have to go back to my old school. But how do I explain this gap to new people? I guess I could say “it was an early gap year” or “I hated my old school” or “they kicked me out.” I’ve already said these in my head, looking for a sentence to silence anyone who asks why I am a year older than everybody, rather than explain my whole complicated history. But then, they’d only have to read my Rookie diaries to know this.
So I am in an awkward position. I am waiting, I am in anticipation, I want to know my exam results right now. But I am pushing all of that away, too. I want more time. To do what, I don’t exactly know. But I always want more time. ♦

I woke up early―easily. Mum was taking Dad to the eye hospital again. She would be back soon, leaving Dad for his checkup. There were university-related Facebook updates―I didn’t take much notice. I turned on the news while I got ready―but I can’t remember one piece of news that day. I gathered my things, got my bike, put David Bowie on; I was as ready as I could be. I just needed to get to school, on my bike, for the first time ever, for the last time ever. On my own. 
I was taking ownership of the whole situation. I could roll in there, and roll out. I just wanted my results, though I still couldn’t comprehend that I’d taken my exams. Not until I was handed my sheet of paper. It felt great. 
I was the freest I’ve ever been―it took going back to school, this place that used to feel so scary to me, to realise that. This time, it was just a building. No one hated me; no one conspired against me. I wasn’t invested in what any person thought. I’d changed.
I was lucky enough to see the people I cared about most, and they were satisfied too. Especially Kathleen, my best friend, who’d gotten into her top-choice university with an A*. I stuck out my middle fingers to the big hall where we’d taken our exams, we tightly hugged, and she waited with me to see my results. Then she told me she was proud of me, and I believed her.
I rode my bike home part of the way with one of my oldest friends, Claire. It was something I’d wished I could do after school every day, but “after school” didn’t exist for me like that. When I was in school, I had often left early or was driven home. Then I just wasn’t there at all. But I did it for this last time.
There were things about not going to school like a regular girl that made me feel wistful, things I had missed out on, but they didn’t matter now. It was all finally over. All being that whole school experience. I rode downhill towards home with the wind shaking all those regrets out of my hair. It was done. 
In the front drive I rang my bell so Mum could see me―smiling on my bike. I shouted “A B C!” when she opened the door. Our hug was the warmest I’ve felt all summer.
So that’s that. That was when I realised how free I can be. ♦

Last week I got my exam results, and I’ll start going to my new school next week. I feel actual excitement at the prospect of this new blank slate, a brand-new timetable, fresh faces, smooth classroom tables, blank notebooks. 
I’d be lying if I didn’t admit to an accompanying spike of nausea and nerves—but this time I’m able to override them. I feel as though I was pulled toward this new term at this new school—I took to the idea of it so easily, after years of stiff awkwardness at my old school. I could have so easily not gone to that open house back in February, but I followed through on that slight tug that I felt. 
I’ve wanted my life to always feel this natural, this smooth. But lately I’ve been re-reading Sylvia Plath’s diaries and discovering E.M. Forster through A Room With a View, and one thing that I have learnt from both of them is this: it’s OK to embrace the awkwardness of life too, not just the smooth. The rough and clunky doesn’t need to be avoided. As Forster writes, “Life is easy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice.” Not much is more relevant to me than that. 
Forster writes such excruciatingly real people—not just characters with “faults” (like a pretty girl who can’t find a man because she is just soooo clumsy!!!) that lesser writers come up with when they’re trying to make someone “three-dimensional.” Forster’s characters have contradictions and confusing traits that make them difficult to pin down. Just like people are. (Though I’ve often wished that people could stay in one box so I wouldn’t have to question how I genuinely feel for them.)
In Plath’s diaries she talks about the strangeness of coming home late when you’ve been out on your own: “I snip off the thread of aloneness and enter into the ritual and rooms that are the family, are the home.” I have had that feeling. But for some reason I didn’t think I should feel it—I thought that I should be able to swiftly move from place to place without any trouble, with no inner adjustments to be made and no threads tying me to anything. I’ve ignored that feeling, while Plath wrote beautifully about it. 
I am glad I am not the only one constantly questioning feelings that don’t sit neatly within me. These two writers make me feel like it is actually all right to write about those feelings instead of ignoring them. Like I might not have to smooth over the cracks in my bewildering life. ♦

At some point in the last few years, I decided to stop needlessly hating on things. I began to think that hating is a waste of time and energy. So, rather than be mean or insensitive toward whatever model or actress is being lambasted or slut-shamed in the media this month, I’d rather think about the reasons why this is happening, why women are so often vilified by the general public, and I’d rather stick up for her.
The same goes for music—I used to be a bit of a music snob. When I was younger, my music collection consisted of the Spice Girls, S Club 7, and compilations of the year’s best-selling songs. I found it hard to relate to people who talked of their superb music taste as a youngster—yeah, I listened to Abbey Road, but I skipped all the songs till “Maxwell’s Silver Hammer” came on. But what happened next is like what happens after your “pink phase,” when you can’t stand the sight of pink and you hate on it as much as possible. I hated whatever Next Big Thing everyone was listening to. 
Now I think: if there is enjoyment to be gained from a catchy song that you can’t get out of your head, is there really any point in denying it? Why not just give in and, in my opinion, live a happier life? 
I was recently in a conversation where the talents of Led Zeppelin and Nicki Minaj were compared and debated. To me, that is akin to comparing a football (soccer) game to a tennis match. Or an apple to an orange. Different skills are involved, different flavours are tasted. Does that make one greater than the other? Not really. Why would I want to be denied the various fruits of life? People sometimes say songs like “Starships” have no great meaning or purpose. Well, maybe that’s true. But personally, I like songs I can sing and dance to and that are simply there to be enjoyed.
It all feels so obvious to me now, but how hard is it to agree that Nicki Minaj and Led Zeppelin are both valid? How hard is it for people to enjoy art without limitations? I’d like to be able to enjoy Shakespeare AND The Hunger Games. I’d like to be a moody, thoughtful teenager AND a massive football (soccer) fan. Mainly, I’d like to listen to Led Zeppelin AND Nicki Minaj. Variety makes life so much more beautiful and less boring. ♦

Wimbledon is over for yet another year. Life always feels a little empty after these two weeks have come and gone. Like any major sporting event, it fills the gaps in your day, giving you something to do before you know what to do with your time, or engrossing you to the point that you dare not leave the room to go to the toilet.
I think “sports” get a bad rap. So does the excitement of “sports fans,” which sometimes seems pointless, boring, or just plain crazy. But I love the connected feeling that you get from watching big events on TV. Sometimes it feels like everybody is watching. I like the relationship between spectacle and spectators, how the crowd becomes a single entity, willing athletes to succeed. I’ve always been a casual enthusiast, but it’s only recently that I’ve realized how much I have grown to love sport of almost any kind. 
There has always been a part of me that is aching to learn about anything. I want to understand as much as possible, and be open to every joy and pleasure. And so sometimes I find myself transfixed by athletes who have been playing a sport for as long as I have been alive and therefore know it with such an intimacy and intensity that it becomes second nature. I love to memorize the jargon, or practice identifying talent and skill—including the slight variations that make the difference between winning and losing. I don’t mind asking my dad a lot of questions. There is still a lot to learn.
Every year, I feel like I understand more, and with understanding comes appreciation. And now suddenly I’m nostalgic about tournaments like Wimbledon, and major sporting events have become an integral part of my life; there is comfort in knowing that the same things always happen at the same time every year. When I was still in school, I’d come home, grab an ice lolly from the freezer and turn on the tennis; the green courts and players kitted out in white were always the first indicator of summer. How strange to think I’ll probably feel this way for the rest of my life. ♦

I am having a problem with happiness. It is a tricky emotion. I think I am happy, and then it eludes me again. Is it to be chased after, or should you wait for it?
Sometimes I am preoccupied by the idea that everything is in my head; my whole life is in my head. It is either a perception of the world now, memories of the past, or what I want for my future. But what I imagine is always cleaner and soft around the edges, and it seems distant. When I come close to it, I can see the hard edges once again, and maybe it’s anxiety, but it feels like I am able to see all the bad things that exist. Then bad thoughts pile up and up. 
Would all my dreams of happiness be better kept in my head? Should I even bother trying to make them a reality? Maybe it is a case of overthinking. Not much works out the way I think it will. Often, the times when I feel fulfilled seem to spring from the ground on their own like a green shoot ready to flower. Suddenly my mind is open and can perceive possibilities, every path rolling out in every direction. I can begin to see the flowers bloom. But the preoccupations of life mean it doesn’t take long for me to forget their colours and scents. 
I have a difficult mind–it takes me a long time to collect a sense of my moods. It’s only when I look back and wonder why I didn’t appreciate that day more, or that summer, or that time that I realize I had happiness. But memories are blurry and not to be trusted entirely. It is easy to smooth over any cracks, to forget the fuzz of discomfort, and how intricate and overlapping emotions really are.
I feel happy writing this right now. I zoned out and am experiencing a comforting tunnel vision. I feel happy writing songs. I feel happy writing anything. It’s similar to the memory feeling, or the dreaming-of-the-future feeling, because thoughts are calm, and bad things don’t intrude. Perhaps reality doesn’t intrude. 
I feel happy when it is dusk and I can look out my bedroom windows to the horizon. Blue to purple to pink clouds gather, and distant trees are haloed by the setting sun. Like right now. It is so quiet. It is the first day I can remember that it is not raining, and I can finally see the texture of the sky. The horizon is like a faded memory, or a future one. It is there, you can see it, but it is far away and has no end. I often have a strong urge to follow the sunset. To try and reach something so pure. ♦

I know who I am when I am on my own. But when I am just another person in a sea of strange faces, it’s like I lose my sense of individuality. I am not myself. 
It feels dangerous to only be sure of my personality and confidence when I am in the comfort of my own home or with my closest friends—among the people who know me the best. Part of me wants to meet new people and craves new experiences but as soon as I am confronted with large numbers of people, I feel lost. I am hyper-aware of my face, my arms—I feel every muscle, every twitch. Everybody else seems calm and normal, while all I can feel is the stress rising in my chest. It’s tiring. Sometimes I can’t tell if other people make me sad, or if I make me sad. 
Sometimes at dusk I sit in my garden and wonder where I would like to go. But these days I think the nicest place must be where I am—in my garden in the summer. Because that is where I am relaxed and at peace.
I hope it won’t always be like this. I want to feel relaxed everywhere and embrace places and people. I want to be able to dance everywhere as freely as I can when I’m alone in my bedroom. I want to feel as free as I do when I’ve got my headphones on and I’m walking through my neighborhood listening to my favorite songs. I want to be able to summon the strength that I know I have. Although I think a lot about escaping, exploring other countries, wanting to be some place else, I am still too scared to set out on my own. And I hate that reality. ♦

During the peak of last week’s heat wave, I went to the farm to see my friend Kathleen. We walked through the hot, empty fields down to the stream, and then through the woods to a plank of wood perched over the water. We talked a lot about feminism, about human beings and ideas. I got frustrated and sad. In the serenity of the woods, the picture of life that our words formed intruded like a dull headache. 
It’s tough to realise that some people don’t want basic reproductive rights for women, or that there are those who think that the way women are sexualised in the media isn’t a problem. I looked up at the sun coming through the trees and reflecting off the water, and wondered how nature can coexist with humanity. Social justice is so important to me, but I felt like if I had the choice right then, I would erase my conscience and lie down for weeks in the grass and flowers. 
I get so angry at the mindlessness of people. I saw a boy litter the other day, and I was seething about the casual attitude of litterers, the wrapper slipping out of their hands as if they hadn’t been there in the first place. I gave him the most evil look ever, and I hope he noticed, because inside I really wanted to knee him in the groin. 
I often feel like I have to wrestle with reality, with people and things that are completely out of tune with me, and resort to my own private little dream world. It’s hard to say exactly what this consists of: a huge amount of daydreams, story lines about future Naomi, alternate Naomi, everything I want to be and am not, and everything I aim to be in the future. I stare into the sky, at the birds, at the planes with their silver bellies, wondering where they go, wanting to be on all of them at once, to be everywhere now. I look at the sunset, the glow on the horizon, and want to follow it or be part of it somehow. 
I am trying to figure out the right balance between the world in my head, where I am cushioned and happy and can surround myself only with the things I truly love, and a “real life” that is full of situations and people that aren’t perfect all the time. I wonder if there is a compromise. I am trying hard to find it. ♦
Naomi
When I am reading my old diary entries, or looking at photos of a younger me, I can never get my head around that that was ME. I was there; I wrote that. Those thoughts came from the same mind that is writing this now. I am all for “living in the moment,” but I hate how little perspective this NEXT NEXT NEXT life gives us. We are all so focused on this minute—or more than that, the next minute. I wish I could bridge the gap between the past me and me now, because I feel oddly detached from myself. I look back and think, Whoa, how did I get here?
Sometimes I am able to have an odd perspective: I realize that one day I will look back at this time and everything that feels so intense to me now, and it will feel just as remote as my old diaries do today. I will look at a picture that will sum up a whole year or more of how I used to dress, how I wore my hair. The news that infiltrates my life every evening—the fighting in Syria, the Leveson media inquiry, the European economy in absolute turmoil—will be just points on a timeline, no more significant than any others over the decades. And although at the age of 18 I feel incredibly old and reasonably wise, I know that one day I will see how young and naïve I really am.
It’s odd that I have to think about even this time last year very hard, to remember what it was actually like. The further away you get from something, the harder it is to remember, and that’s good, in a way. Especially if you don’t want a bad experience hanging over you. But at the same time, I wish I could hold all my experiences at once. I wish I could hold my whole life so far in the palm of my hand and feel it as it really was. ♦

This past week I had my last therapy session. Therapy, in one form or another, has been a constant in my life for almost three years now. I am not scared though. I think I have learned as much as I can learn about myself at this point. It used to be refreshing to talk to someone outside my family and circle of friends, but eventually I just grew bored of talking about myself. In the beginning I needed someone to help me carry the load. Now, on my good days at least, I feel strong enough to carry it myself. Maybe this means I am stronger than I have been for a long time.
I am unsure about my near future—the idea of going back to school to complete my education gives me feelings of trepidation, of course—but I’ve learned to be a lot more in tune with myself, and I often know how to make myself feel better when I’m low. I’ve figured a lot out on my own.
The other day I went on one of my marathon walks and sort of compared my life over the past year to walking a long distance. I kept putting one foot in front of the other, sometimes looking down, sometimes looking ahead, and sometimes—perhaps not often enough—glancing around to admire the scenery. Occasionally I looked back on a long sweep of a road to see how far I’d come. I’d think, I did that, and then look at the next curved path and think, I can do that, too.
Cheesy metaphors aside (LIFE IS A JOURNEY; DON’T FORGET TO SMELL THE FLOWERS, SON), it is difficult to fathom how far I have actually come in the past year. While I was walking my iPod was on shuffle and a Sufjan Stevens song from his album The Age of Adz came on, and I remembered how crucial that album was to my getting better. Last August it was the only thing I could listen to that made me feel anything. That month, my walks were hard. I had to struggle to lift my iron legs and usually could make it only as far as the nearest park. But I made myself walk that far, at least. Those tiny walks, accompanied by that music, somehow made me realise that I could live again. I feel a little wistful that that music doesn’t have the same power over me now. It meant so much to me just nine months ago; now it’s just like an echo.
Last year it took superhuman strength just for me to leave the house. When I forced myself outside, I could sometimes make it only as far as a bench 15 metres from our door before I had to give up and come back. Now, I feel light enough to walk for miles. 
These days, I can make it all the way to the belly of the city—the last frontier for my limitations and anxiety. The city centre used to seem big and scary to me, full of people much bigger than me. Now I walk there and realise that I have grown, while the city has stayed pretty much the same. I fill its spaces a bit more, and they no longer feel like they are going to swallow me.
I used to wish I had no limitations. Now I realize that most of our limitations are only in our heads. I know I can be strong. ♦

This week has been a littler tougher than what I’ve been used to lately. But I know, and I keep repeating in my head, that there are ups and downs to everything in life―including anxiety. There’s been a lot of it recently, and it’s a huge black blot on my mind. When general anxiety comes on like this, it’s both surprising and familiar, like when someone hugs you from behind and you feel uncomfortable because you don’t know who it is. But I do know what it is. I can’t see it, but I can feel it. I now understand the power that anxiety wields in my life. I suppose this means I am no longer walking blind, just wondering why things are so hard. 
I wish I didn’t talk about anxiety so often. It seems to be the main thing flowing from my fingers right now though. It’s taking over, affecting my life, intercepting every other thought, occupying the muscles in my forehead and neck and shoulders, destroying my appetite, ruining my conversations. It’s venom in my veins. It’s a ball and chain around my ankles. It can make me selfish and short-sighted. I close myself off from the world. I know it’s hard for other people to understand; sometimes even I can’t understand.
I know I can be better at controlling how much it affects me, but recently I’ve lost my grasp a little. I’ve let it take over more than I should have. And as always, life flows on without me, not stopping to let me catch up. Like all the times before, I just have to pick myself up and hope that the people around me and the world in general will not stop giving me a chance to do better. I have to hope that I will give myself a chance to do better. I wonder whether there will be a day when I no longer have to talk about anxiety. ♦

I am unsure about my near future—the idea of going back to school to complete my education gives me feelings of trepidation, of course—but I’ve learned to be a lot more in tune with myself, and I often know how to make myself feel better when I’m low. I’ve figured a lot out on my own.
The other day I went on one of my marathon walks and sort of compared my life over the past year to walking a long distance. I kept putting one foot in front of the other, sometimes looking down, sometimes looking ahead, and sometimes—perhaps not often enough—glancing around to admire the scenery. Occasionally I looked back on a long sweep of a road to see how far I’d come. I’d think, I did that, and then look at the next curved path and think, I can do that, too.
Cheesy metaphors aside (LIFE IS A JOURNEY; DON’T FORGET TO SMELL THE FLOWERS, SON), it is difficult to fathom how far I have actually come in the past year. While I was walking my iPod was on shuffle and a Sufjan Stevens song from his album The Age of Adz came on, and I remembered how crucial that album was to my getting better. Last August it was the only thing I could listen to that made me feel anything. That month, my walks were hard. I had to struggle to lift my iron legs and usually could make it only as far as the nearest park. But I made myself walk that far, at least. Those tiny walks, accompanied by that music, somehow made me realise that I could live again. I feel a little wistful that that music doesn’t have the same power over me now. It meant so much to me just nine months ago; now it’s just like an echo.
Last year it took superhuman strength just for me to leave the house. When I forced myself outside, I could sometimes make it only as far as a bench 15 metres from our door before I had to give up and come back. Now, I feel light enough to walk for miles. 
These days, I can make it all the way to the belly of the city—the last frontier for my limitations and anxiety. The city centre used to seem big and scary to me, full of people much bigger than me. Now I walk there and realise that I have grown, while the city has stayed pretty much the same. I fill its spaces a bit more, and they no longer feel like they are going to swallow me.
I used to wish I had no limitations. Now I realize that most of our limitations are only in our heads. I know I can be strong. ♦

This week has been a littler tougher than what I’ve been used to lately. But I know, and I keep repeating in my head, that there are ups and downs to everything in life―including anxiety. There’s been a lot of it recently, and it’s a huge black blot on my mind. When general anxiety comes on like this, it’s both surprising and familiar, like when someone hugs you from behind and you feel uncomfortable because you don’t know who it is. But I do know what it is. I can’t see it, but I can feel it. I now understand the power that anxiety wields in my life. I suppose this means I am no longer walking blind, just wondering why things are so hard. 
I wish I didn’t talk about anxiety so often. It seems to be the main thing flowing from my fingers right now though. It’s taking over, affecting my life, intercepting every other thought, occupying the muscles in my forehead and neck and shoulders, destroying my appetite, ruining my conversations. It’s venom in my veins. It’s a ball and chain around my ankles. It can make me selfish and short-sighted. I close myself off from the world. I know it’s hard for other people to understand; sometimes even I can’t understand.
I know I can be better at controlling how much it affects me, but recently I’ve lost my grasp a little. I’ve let it take over more than I should have. And as always, life flows on without me, not stopping to let me catch up. Like all the times before, I just have to pick myself up and hope that the people around me and the world in general will not stop giving me a chance to do better. I have to hope that I will give myself a chance to do better. I wonder whether there will be a day when I no longer have to talk about anxiety. ♦

Nostalgic weather: when it’s very green and very damp and you think it should be getting dark by now but there’s still pale blue light when it is time to get into a hot bath. The leaves aren’t tired summer leaves, but have just burst, sharing space with dropping blossom. The whole sky seems lower and shared, not something impossibly high up. When there are crystal drops hanging from the trees but it is dry enough for the birds to start singing.
Two years ago my best friend wasn’t my best friend. She hadn’t helped steer my life back to a saner course yet. She was just a really really cool girl I had English class with. I remember that summer it rained a lot, but not grey drizzle—it was like green rain. When she invited a bunch of her classmates to her family’s farm, I didn’t, I wouldn’t, I couldn’t go. I sat in the car with my legs firmly on the ground outside—I did that a lot. Driving felt a bit like drowning. I wasn’t in control. The only things that made me cry were Jane Eyre and my exam results. The former, a warm burst drain. The latter, squeezed ice. But the day after I didn’t go to the farm I sat on the back step and watched the rain bounce down the roof and the air was fresh enough, the rain loud and hard enough, to make my skin tingle and the blood in my veins flow again. I had so much fear that I had no idea what to do with.
The next year she invited us again, and this time I didn’t even try. I stayed in the bath and tried to cry instead. By then Kathleen had helped me—a lot—and I felt bad for myself and for her. For myself because my anxiety didn’t allow me to go, and for her because we were close and I knew I was hurting her. That’s when I began to realise that proper connections with people do not just involve your feelings; the other person’s are really important too. That awareness that this world contains people other than myself burst my bubble—in a good way.
Recently it’s become simple to look back on those times and think, I am better. If there is something I want to do, but it is hard or it is scary, I increasingly think, Do I want the kind of life where I can…, and the answer is always yes. Do I want the kind of life where I can drive to the farm where my best friend lives even though the bathroom only just got a door and still has no lock? Yes.
And so I did. Last week me and Mum drove to Kathleen’s farm through a massive pourdown. As we drove up and higher and further away from our town, I could look back and see the houses engulfed in a grey misty cloud. I thought I owed this to Kathleen, but also to the Naomi of last summer and the Naomi of the summer before. While they stayed at home feeling sullenly stagnant, they also stayed mildly hopeful that one day it wouldn’t be such a huge problem to do what was so impossible before. ♦

We’re only running one diary this week, Ruby’s, because we’re too sad to edit the other ones right now. Minna, Dylan, Naomi, and Katherine will be back next week.
Ruby
My mother died last night. She was far away from us when it happened.
I don’t want to think about why.
She was in so much pain for so much of her life, and she stayed here for us until she couldn’t.
The last time I remember speaking to her was when she took us to Target. She was in a rush and wasn’t paying too much attention to me. The day before we had cried together and said we love each other. She said she loves me so much. I said I love her too. I hope she believed me.
She dropped us off at school on Monday. That’s the last time I saw her before she left us and then everything. I think I remember being mad at her and leaving without a word. My sister says that was on Friday, and that the last thing I said was goodbye.
I’m so sorry for acting like I hated her sometimes. She isn’t like anyone else and she understands me more than anyone.
We were so close and yet so distant. Is this a memory? Is this a dream?
I keep telling myself I’m going to wake up and she will be home. I was angry at her for leaving home until I heard she was gone forever. Now I don’t know what to think.
I feel empty. I feel like I can’t cry as much as I should. I don’t understand and it doesn’t feel real. My brother and sister cried, too. Of course they did. We all love her.
I searched her room, trying to find things that smelled like her. I needed to find something. I found her favorite coat—the same coat that led me to believe she would come back because I thought she would never leave without it. 
I don’t know if I can ever see anything the same way again.
“You write essays as good as David Sedaris,” she said in the car one time. She was saying I probably had ADD and was reassuring me that nothing was wrong with me. 
“You are perfect,” she has said countless times. She is perfect, but her problems sometimes overshadowed the real her. She’s perfect now.
I love you, Mom, and I’m so sorry that I didn’t act like it all the time. I love you. ♦

Last week I went on “holiday” for the first time in around three years. It was more like a little break—two days and two nights—but I slept away from my bed, my bedroom, the same view and feelings I’ve had for years. It was weird. My little head was confused. It couldn’t decide whether this meant I could relax completely or my anxiety should go into overdrive. I did a little of both.
Me and mum stayed in this little cottage on the edge of a wood, in a deep valley, in a little village, down a long winding road. The quiet was loud; I walked into the woods on a muddy morning and could only hear my footsteps. So I paused… nothing. Occasionally I would catch the sound of the stream, or birdsong. It was an unnatural feeling for me, a suburban girl. At home, true silence is a rare and precious thing. Usually I can hear cars and people and the like, and have to put on my headphones to block out all the noise. At the cottage, listening to music felt almost rude. I want to go back.
Our town is a small town, but it’s nothing like the country. People in the little villages in the English countryside are not like me and my family. They are kind of intimidating. They vote Conservative, and they can be hostile to outsiders. I suppose they feel just as odd and intimidated, though, when visiting cities and suburbs.
I used to think I was secretly a country person, having always felt a deep connection to nature. But I would miss the strangers and the art of the street, the hardened layer you develop as protection in a city that would be interpreted as rudeness in an isolated village. It’s not as cleansing as you might think it would be, being away from traffic, from the internet, from litter on the street. I suppose, as this was my first time away from home in so long, I was a little confused. But if I can go there, after so much time not being able to go anywhere at all, think of all the other places I can go to and form opinions about. The world is so great. You have to leave home sometimes to see how you adapt and cope, to see what parts of your personality come out. To know whether something you have with you at home is an illusion, or will follow you wherever you go. ♦

I have this memory. A couple of months ago I was stranded on the island of my bed, my toe propped up and swollen. The light was in its pre-dusk purity, settling gently on my walls with its clippings and pictures. The sky had soaked my bedroom, and in its center was the pearl of my mum’s hand, clutching a crayon as she wrote and decorated my birthday list while I searched my head for present ideas. Sitting at my desk, she drew my name and concentrated on colouring flowers. Red and green and purple decorated the paper. She was doing something I try to do as much as possible: to create a small alternate world inside the real one, a bubble of time when focus lets you quiet a brimming mind. Her presence calmed me; I didn’t want to speak too much to break her peace. For once I could step back and observe her—my mother is graceful, for a moment as natural as the trees outside, and that is something I usually miss in our busy lives. We were sharing that moment, but still in our separate worlds. When you co-exist with someone in silence, you let each other’s minds flow freely, but you still have company. Sometimes you get to know someone most deeply not in conversation, but in these shared silences. My toe ceased its throbbing for a while. Once Mum had finished and left my room for dinner, it was a lonely silence again.
I am already looking back at this year so far and seeing all that I have done, every test of my strength I have survived, including being bedbound with an injury. I am almost done with exams for this year, most of which I have done by myself. But I wasn’t really by myself. I had Mum. And I certainly had Dad. And I have every other person who has contributed in little or large ways to making me feel more like me.
I had to go back to my old school to sit these exams as an “external student,” and I am pretty sure I’ll have a lot to get off my chest next week. For now, I have a little more revision to do. ♦
Naomi
Exams are over, and now it all seems so long ago. That morning I woke up with intense nausea, wondering how I would be able to sit through a whole test. I was met with mostly kind eyes: my mum (whose eyes betrayed a hint of trepidation), the intensely lovely exam coordinator (who somehow managed to give me special attention despite having to organise all the school exams), and the gentle-voiced exam invigilator (who oversees you doing the actual exam). I was extremely fortunate to have such kind people coax me into that little classroom. 
During the exams, I sat right on the edge of my chair, ready to leap out at any point. It was only when I read the questions and knew I was capable of answering them that I started to calm down. Those days were a mix of elation, nausea, clammy hands, relief, relaxation, and contentment. In the end, I didn’t despise going back to my old school, the one I left because it overwhelmed and scared me. 
Some memories came back. I saw groups of people in the halls, girls I had gone to school with every day. Maybe they didn’t recognise me—maybe they didn’t want to—but I didn’t get many greetings. I suppose what had once been a thick rope tying me and them, me and that school, had now become a single, thin thread.
All those eyes made me glad I wasn’t back for good. Eyes that glare and judge and hurt—even if they are not trying to. The smell was also overwhelming—it was the same as it had been throughout the seven years I was a student at that school—and it brought a rush of more memories. The teachers’ faces made my insides twist with familiarity. I remembered choosing navy school trousers that had to have a pocket for tissues—my year-seven innocence now makes me feel sick. That’s when a sea of fear started to drown me, a sea that eventually swallowed me. Hatred that drove me away from other people, entwined with anxiety so strong that it’s blurred all my memories and blocked me from any belonging I might have felt.
When the young Naomi walked down those corridors, did anyone ever guess what she was going through? When I walked through those exact same doors last week, did I experience a taste of nostalgia that felt foreign on my tongue, half-wishing I was still there? 
It doesn’t matter now, I am sure of that. I only have to go back one more time to get my results, and then that’s it forever. I think I will be glad I won’t have to think about it anymore. That school existed with me, it existed without me, it shall exist for many years to come—but I don’t have to give it one more thought. And all the bad feelings I had while I was there—it can keep them. I’m letting them go. 
Anxiety makes everything seem impossible. But that is a lie—one example among many of the warped vision of the world that anxiety gives you. Anything is possible, even things you have held tight in your head for a long time. Anxiety made me think that there was no way I was going to do my exams, but I did them, and I did well. Realizing that perception is not reality helped me through. Positive thinking isn’t something tangible, something you can hold on to—like nervously clutching the seat of a safe car or hands around a warm cup of ginger tea or watching Murder, She Wrote in the safety of your bedroom—but it doesn’t hurt. Doing exams gave me a good feeling that can spur me forward. Now I can let go of the bad school feelings that held me back. ♦

The start of this past week was warm in Birmingham, and I got used to planning my days around sitting outside. I worked in the sun, I read in the sun, I listened to music in the sun. My concentration was sharp, my head was clear. My face got red, my legs got brown—it was like a little holiday. And what was the reason? I am pretty sure it was my lessened anxiety. I was on a roll. So it had to end, right? 
Thursday morning I woke up early, ate my breakfast slowly, and promised productivity to the day. In breaks between work, I wandered the garden, noticing that so much time outside had allowed me to determine what time of day it was based on where the light hit the ground. That felt lovely. I’d rather have integral knowledge about the rotation of the Earth than most other things. I was thinking about writing this very diary. There was something unknown in the atmosphere that I decided to ignore. It was unreasonably quiet, and it felt like something was going to crack.
It turned out to be my toe. As I was taking my laptop downstairs to do yet MORE work, I dropped it on my foot. A few days later, my big toe is still swollen and painful and starting to bruise. 
This particular shade of blue is the new must-have colour.
Maybe that was the universe telling me to be careful. Then I got my fucking PERIOD. A week early! Now, instead of the sensation of sun on my skin, I feel PAIN. And here I thought I was doing well: controlling my mood, being productive, going outside, reading lots. And stuff beyond my control had to go and fuck it up. I hate that. Usually I have to SELF-sabotage in order to avoid life activities. Damn you, universe!
I like to think that when things like this happen, you can get something out of it. Make the most of it, let’s say. Well, I have been trying, and I can’t. Worryingly, it also feeds into my fear that happiness, or feeling good, can’t last very long. Something has to come along and stop it. For three days, I’ve been solely on my bum with my leg propped up, getting bored and doing nothing. I tortured myself with thoughts of having kept a tighter grip on my laptop or just moving my feet out of the way. I always ask: why? Why did events take this particular order? I know questioning things like this is futile. 
I suppose my life lesson this week is: shit happens. ♦
Naomi
My toe hasn’t healed yet. I am still hobbling around on it, but I won’t divulge all the gory details and I will most certainly save you a photo of its progress.
So, it has been a pretty dull week. I haven’t felt able to leave the house because it’s still so painful to walk. Right after my laptop mishap happened and my toe began to swell up like a balloon, I thought the healing process would last a couple of days. Oh, how wrong I was. These past 10 days have felt like weeks. 
My mind is an absolute mess; my dreams are crazy. I’ve been listening to the Smiths a lot, and one night’s dreams were all of Morrissey. The last one was my favourite: Morrissey with Robert Plant’s hair talking about how important children’s nursery rhymes were to him. In last night’s dream I was in Germany on a weird school-trip type thing, a reflection of all the schoolwork I have to do on Nazi Germany. The worst was when my best friend died in my back garden. I told her (in real life) that she had died in my dream, and it didn’t seem to bother her that much.
Walking and exercise have become important coping tools for the shit that life throws at me, and without them, I was been completely lost, but then I found ways to sit still and create the same kind of separation from the world that I feel when I am walking or jogging. I found drawing and listening to music simultaneously to be very effective when you have to no room to think about anything and just need a break. Also good: flicking through art books (Matisse and Van Gogh), while Morrissey (with his own hair this time) sings to me. It’s nice to know I can adapt to change without spiraling deep down. Also my brother is back from uni for Easter, and he can make me laugh and annoy me and otherwise put me in touch with a small spectrum of emotion outside of just boredom.
On reflection, I’ve coped really damn well. Now I am terrified about what lies ahead. First off, my birthday. Dammit my 18th birthday. What. Then me and les parents are going on a little holiday. Half of me is overjoyed, the rest is worried because I can’t remember the last time I didn’t sleep in my own bed—anxiety, anxiety. THEN I’ve lost over a week of good working time and my exams are next month. NEXT MONTH. How. Why. I can’t. Do this.
SO. All of that stuff is a tangle of anxiety and stress and fear, but there is also so much hope and enjoyment to be had to. I felt on top of it before this toe business, I really did. It feels so unfair that it had to happen now, but also lucky that it didn’t happen around birthday/holiday/exams. Eurgh I am so confused and crazy—while I just want it all to be over with, I am also stupidly avoiding thinking about or doing anything. But I have an excuse, right? My toe hurts… ♦

I have nothing to write about apart from studying and recovering from my toe injury. This is what my life has become. Sorry, Mum; sorry, Dad; and sorry, baby Jesus—I have now become the worst thing in the world: boring. And I cannot see an end in sight. Please just let me wallow in my room in my Smiths shirt I haven’t removed in a week, my default position being crouched over history folders. I feel I will be in this position for all eternity, like that Inca mummy girl. 
I suppose it’s my own fault for attempting this thing called life. Can life give me a break so I can just watch Morrissey and Marr dancing together on repeat? For eternity. Waiting for my toenail to fall off.
You didn’t just read that! No, here are the things that I’d much rather be doing right now:

Dancing with Morrissey and Marr.
For a while on Sunday I told Mum I’d rather be a ginger biscuit, but she said she would crush me to make the base of a cheesecake, so I figure that wouldn’t work out.
Having a week suspended in time where I can figure out what turning 18 next week really means (my mind says it has to MEAN something—not just that I was born 18 years ago; that would be too simple).
Buying a plane ticket to New York and just GOING! On my own. With on bag. Without a toothbrush.
Generally doing whatever, without being stopped by fear.
Being in a place where physical pain and anxiety symptoms don’t exist (dancing with Morrissey and Marr).
Being on a British beach that is miraculously neither windy nor chilly.
Being anywhere not windy or chilly.
Being on a farm. Oh wait, my best friend lives on a farm now, see ya!
Fast-forward to birthday: having a nice birthday. Rewind to January: starting to work harder earlier. Fast-forward to the end of May: no more exams.

It’s the worst when your reality is dragging and it leaks into your imagination and then even your daydreams don’t seem that exciting. I mean, a ginger biscuit? Is this the best I can come up with? But at least ginger biscuits don’t have to take exams. Or turn 18. Oh wait, shit, this biscuit is from 1852! That means it turned I-got-a-C-in-maths years old! It should meet up with the Inca chick. ♦

Last Friday, I had a double whammy of unsavoury experiences, both involving street harassment. Maybe this is an unfortunate rite of passage, seeing as I’ll be 18 by the time you read this (happy birthday to me!!!). I heard my first whistle at 13, and I’ve had enough car honks to last a lifetime, but those were harmless in comparison to this.
One thing men will never truly understand is the constant threat of unwanted attention that women have to deal with. My fellow Rookies and I had a discussion about this, and it made me realise that if you ask any women on this planet, she’s likely to have had at least one experience, possibly multiple, with street harassment (if not worse). It seems to be something that we have to prepare for every time we leave the house.
When I left the house this time, I didn’t prepare—I was more concerned with whether it was going to rain. I walked to the lake, which was quiet as usual. I decided to take the long way home, the one where the only people I encounter are usually dog walkers.
There were two boys at the park entrance, and I thought nothing of it. I had my headphones on but could tell one of them had addressed me. I can’t remember exactly what he said, something about “love at first sight” and my “pussy” and “behind.” I put my headphones back on and walked by, without music this time, so that I could stay aware. I thought that would be the end of it, but they kept following me. They were tormenting me, and I didn’t know what else they would do or when they would stop. They discussed my iPod and I wondered whether they would rob me, but no, I “must be poor” because I had an “old one.” I felt so completely bare, in an empty park, like I had no protection. When I got to the road again, they thankfully gave up, and when I was far enough away to feel rid of them, I just wanted to sit down and recover. And my gosh, I really needed a hug.
I found a bench on the green, surrounded by shops. I had just sat down when I was approached by a man who asked if I was OK. I thought maybe he was a concerned stranger? But that wasn’t the vibe I was getting. He asked for my name and number. I refused. He asked how old I was. I said 18, and he sounded mildly (but not that convincingly) surprised and said he was 30. He asked if I wanted to take his number “just in case.” No. Then he asked if I would like to come back to his flat. No! I was creeped out. I didn’t want to be there any longer, I just wanted to be home. Luckily he got the message, and I walked away, past the leering men smoking outside the pub. Everyone I saw made me flinch. I don’t know how he had the nerve! Mum said I might have looked vulnerable, which make me feel even more icky.
Honestly, I felt like shit. I hoped writing it all out would help me get over it, but I keep on thinking “ew.” Ew that males both older and younger thought it was perfectly all right to treat me like that. Ew that as a women I have to deal with a society within where people will treat me like some kind of object. Ew that my friends and I will probably have to deal with this in one form or another for the rest of our lives. It was the life sentence that bothered me the most. My daughter will probably have to endure this as well.
Now please, tell me feminism doesn’t need to exist. Tell me that I shouldn’t believe that future generations will look back and say, “That shit used to happen?” Tell me I shouldn’t be fucking angry. ♦

Please just let me wallow in my room in my Smiths shirt I haven’t removed in a week, my default position being crouched over history folders. I feel I will be in this position for all eternity, like that Inca mummy girl. 
I suppose it’s my own fault for attempting this thing called life. Can life give me a break so I can just watch Morrissey and Marr dancing together on repeat? For eternity. Waiting for my toenail to fall off.
You didn’t just read that! No, here are the things that I’d much rather be doing right now:

Dancing with Morrissey and Marr.
For a while on Sunday I told Mum I’d rather be a ginger biscuit, but she said she would crush me to make the base of a cheesecake, so I figure that wouldn’t work out.
Having a week suspended in time where I can figure out what turning 18 next week really means (my mind says it has to MEAN something—not just that I was born 18 years ago; that would be too simple).
Buying a plane ticket to New York and just GOING! On my own. With on bag. Without a toothbrush.
Generally doing whatever, without being stopped by fear.
Being in a place where physical pain and anxiety symptoms don’t exist (dancing with Morrissey and Marr).
Being on a British beach that is miraculously neither windy nor chilly.
Being anywhere not windy or chilly.
Being on a farm. Oh wait, my best friend lives on a farm now, see ya!
Fast-forward to birthday: having a nice birthday. Rewind to January: starting to work harder earlier. Fast-forward to the end of May: no more exams.

It’s the worst when your reality is dragging and it leaks into your imagination and then even your daydreams don’t seem that exciting. I mean, a ginger biscuit? Is this the best I can come up with? But at least ginger biscuits don’t have to take exams. Or turn 18. Oh wait, shit, this biscuit is from 1852! That means it turned I-got-a-C-in-maths years old! It should meet up with the Inca chick. ♦

Last Friday, I had a double whammy of unsavoury experiences, both involving street harassment. Maybe this is an unfortunate rite of passage, seeing as I’ll be 18 by the time you read this (happy birthday to me!!!). I heard my first whistle at 13, and I’ve had enough car honks to last a lifetime, but those were harmless in comparison to this.
One thing men will never truly understand is the constant threat of unwanted attention that women have to deal with. My fellow Rookies and I had a discussion about this, and it made me realise that if you ask any women on this planet, she’s likely to have had at least one experience, possibly multiple, with street harassment (if not worse). It seems to be something that we have to prepare for every time we leave the house.
When I left the house this time, I didn’t prepare—I was more concerned with whether it was going to rain. I walked to the lake, which was quiet as usual. I decided to take the long way home, the one where the only people I encounter are usually dog walkers.
There were two boys at the park entrance, and I thought nothing of it. I had my headphones on but could tell one of them had addressed me. I can’t remember exactly what he said, something about “love at first sight” and my “pussy” and “behind.” I put my headphones back on and walked by, without music this time, so that I could stay aware. I thought that would be the end of it, but they kept following me. They were tormenting me, and I didn’t know what else they would do or when they would stop. They discussed my iPod and I wondered whether they would rob me, but no, I “must be poor” because I had an “old one.” I felt so completely bare, in an empty park, like I had no protection. When I got to the road again, they thankfully gave up, and when I was far enough away to feel rid of them, I just wanted to sit down and recover. And my gosh, I really needed a hug.
I found a bench on the green, surrounded by shops. I had just sat down when I was approached by a man who asked if I was OK. I thought maybe he was a concerned stranger? But that wasn’t the vibe I was getting. He asked for my name and number. I refused. He asked how old I was. I said 18, and he sounded mildly (but not that convincingly) surprised and said he was 30. He asked if I wanted to take his number “just in case.” No. Then he asked if I would like to come back to his flat. No! I was creeped out. I didn’t want to be there any longer, I just wanted to be home. Luckily he got the message, and I walked away, past the leering men smoking outside the pub. Everyone I saw made me flinch. I don’t know how he had the nerve! Mum said I might have looked vulnerable, which make me feel even more icky.
Honestly, I felt like shit. I hoped writing it all out would help me get over it, but I keep on thinking “ew.” Ew that males both older and younger thought it was perfectly all right to treat me like that. Ew that as a women I have to deal with a society within where people will treat me like some kind of object. Ew that my friends and I will probably have to deal with this in one form or another for the rest of our lives. It was the life sentence that bothered me the most. My daughter will probably have to endure this as well.
Now please, tell me feminism doesn’t need to exist. Tell me that I shouldn’t believe that future generations will look back and say, “That shit used to happen?” Tell me I shouldn’t be fucking angry. ♦

I’ve been staring at this screen so much this week, writing writing writing, squeezing words out of my brain to fill a word requirement. This week some phantom assignments sprang out of nowhere—I take classes over the internet, and I must have missed an email at some point—with suddenly close deadlines. 
Freaked out, I got my first extension of my life, and now everything has to be in by the 15th of March. So my writing capabilities have started to go numb. But I coped! I didn’t even go into crisis mode, which historically has meant a stressed-out version of myself who doesn’t eat and is wracked with fatigue. This time, I just got on with it. I am actually letting myself be proud of myself, too, which is something. 
After I had posted two assignments (out of four) on Friday, I went on the loveliest walk. The sun was starting to go down, so everything was beginning to look washed out. The moon was rising, car lights were streaming down the roads and crocuses budding in the park. 
In the evening I watched Wendy and Lucy, which significantly improved my weekend. Have you seen this movie? You should! Michelle Williams plays a gal who has nothing but a car and her dog, and is searching for work. The movie is slow and poetic and lyrical, and it just hit me. 
I suppose the film is too slow by some people’s standards, and maybe some people think it’s pointless. My favourite films tend to be those with a lot of nature and snapshots of beauty that jibe with the way I see the world. (On the IMDb boards there is always someone describing my favourite films as boring [e.g., this thread].) It’s so hard to describe how you see the world, and so strange when you realize that other people’s brains work completely differently from yours. That’s probably why when a film or a book or a piece of music speaks to you, it’s such a powerful feeling. 
I cried at the end of Wendy and Lucy. It wasn’t only because it looked pretty, but because of how much emotion its images held (then again it involved a dog, and films with animals knock me sideways every time). My emotions correlate with my own surroundings; I think our environments always reflect our feelings. Our humanity is linked with where we are and what things look like. And when it comes down to it, how much we like what we see.
Then Saturday I spent the day with my dearest friend, Claire. We watched the three-hour-long, action-packed Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, and we agreed it seemed much much shorter. I love LOTR. I love the campiness and the drama and the comradeship and the emotion that is pushed in your face. Obvious emotion also makes my heart swell (when done well). And you know what? I’ve may have teared up at the end of the third film in that series. ♦

It was early afternoon. I was using my laptop, and I noticed the calender read April 24. Shit, it’s my birthday. But I usually unwrap my presents in the morning, and nobody has said “happy birthday.” I went into the sitting room and tried to explain to Mum and Dad that it was my 18th birthday, and that this is a big deal. But it was like there was a glass wall between us, and they couldn’t understand what I was saying. Eventually I was screaming and crying, but they ignored me. It was like I didn’t exist, and my 18th was ignored by everyone. 
When I woke up I realised how scared I must be of my next birthday.
Why? A number of reasons:

1. I feel like, after 18, you can never go back. It’s a milestone age. Here in England, I will be able to vote, drink, and get married. Though I am really looking forward to the freedom, I don’t think I want to be considered an adult just yet. I am far from being an adult.
2. Birthdays and Christmases and important events always involve so much pressure. Is it just me? The need for them to be good or fun or whatever makes me anxious, because the only thing worse than not celebrating them at all would be having a bad time. It’s a downward spiral from there. Also, you can’t help but reflect and compare yourself to last year, which is all kinds of no good.
3. What the hell do I do to celebrate? At the moment, I am not really a partying sort of person, yet I feel obliged to be one for this occasion. I want it to be special, but I don’t know how. I wish I could have a ’60s- or ’70s-themed dance party, where people would dress up and play some records, but I’d only have a few people to invite anyway. 
4. What the hell do I ask for? Now that I’m older, presents have started to feel different. What’s becoming more important is how happy I am, not what I have. (Wow. That sounds decidedly adult.)
5. My 17th birthday was awful. I was so unhappy. I was so scared of turning 17 because time was just slipping through my fingers so fast, and I was crippled with fear. I didn’t feel ready to be 17, so I ended up doing nothing at all.
6. I am scared of being scared. I know that doesn’t bode well. It isn’t good to be scared.

But I want to celebrate turning 18. When I was younger, I didn’t imagine myself being in the position that I am in now. I don’t know who I thought I’d be. Maybe someone carefree? I didn’t realise that adolescence is not carefree, at least not for people like me.
I am hoping my 20s will be. And then maybe I can have all the celebration I might want for my 18th on my 21st? 
Either way, I need serious help with this year’s birthday. ♦

Whenever my discontentment rises to the surface—which it has to from time to time so that it can sink again and dry out and I can go back to remembering what I do have—I find myself gravitating helplessly around the same thoughts. I begin to dream of visiting a faraway place—one that sadly doesn’t really exist. I become hopeless about ever finding Thunder Road.

See, me and my main man Bruce Springsteen are dreamers. I am pretty sure our souls are made of the same stuff. Bruce’s early music is obsessed with youth: the intense anger and the constant searching for somewhere you belong. The desire to run away, to search for a magical place you aren’t even sure exists. At least that’s what it has come to mean to me over the past year. His music is a world that I can retreat to, where daydreams don’t seem so silly.
But my dreams and desires so often embarrass me. It’s the most personal thing you can reveal, I think: what you desperately want, what you want so much that it pains you to imagine its never happening. Sometimes it hurts to listen to Bruce’s music because it’s filled with the life and vivacity that I want eventually for myself. It sows the seeds for the kind of path I want to follow—and I am terrified I won’t be able to follow it. I am still not even sure what I want is what I want or if it’s just what society has TOLD me to want (e.g., recognition, power, success). Am I being truthful to myself? Am I being realistic? My imagined future changes according to what mood I am in that day, or what has caught my eye or what cloud my head is stuck in. It’s like I have two parallel lives, the one in my head and the other one that involves crappy stuff and is sometimes boring and disappointing.
So after bottling it up for a long while, I bared my soul a little to my friend Kathleen on Sunday. We agreed that the intensity of being a teenager means you can sometimes love something and hate it simultaneously. We listened to “Born to Run” and suddenly I didn’t feel the need to punch the wall—it’s just THAT GOOD. As we looked out of her bedroom window at our town, we both decided that our place in the world probably won’t be found on the suburban streets of Birmingham. To share that feeling with another human being is a comfort.
Maybe it’s Thunder Road I think about at times like this because it’s also the journey to that place. Maybe there isn’t a particular place to be. Maybe you carry it with you. And the song has that endless sense of possibility: “These two lanes will take us anywhere.” ANYWHERE. I want to go anywhere!
Whatever my future anxieties may be (exams, new school, etc.), I am proud to say that I am in a much better place than I was this time last year. Like, miles ahead. So yes, there is more I need to do to get to where I want to be, but where I am now is an achievement in itself!
And when I get so sick of neighbourhood that I can’t stand the sight of it, I can just close my eyes and listen to Bruce singing about desperately wanting to get out of town and find his own place in the world.



Naomi
When moments and then whole days that are not hindered by anxiety start building up, I kind of start feeling bits of me returning. You know, baby’s back! 
 
(Since last week I think the Bruce floodgates have opened and the references probably won’t stop. But I’ve been listening to this song all weekend, so deal with it.)
This is a little unnerving though, because parts of me that might have been taken up by anxiety are suddenly free. It’s like I have more space to spread out. It sounds strange, maybe, but sometimes I feel a bit empty without my anxiety, and I just walk around quietly in a sort of daze. It’s a transition I suppose, just like I am trying now to transition to spring. Here’s a photo of my house:

Only kidding. The weather here in Birmingham has been so unbelievably gorgeous—unusual for March—so me and Mum drove through green sun-soaked fields on Sunday. It doesn’t take long to get to the country from where we live. I don’t know, it’s kind of enough for me at the moment to widen my horizons past where they have been. It’s like I’m escaping from a cocoon where I’ve lived for a long time, and so everything is freshly beautiful. I can appreciate it all—walks around a country moat with my mum on a sunny afternoon especially. Thank you for taking photos, Mum, ’cause it feels a little like a daydream now. Just how I am going to do my politics and history assignments with this weather going on I have no idea. ♦



Naomi
Maybe I am just not cut out for academics.
This month will be spent desperately trying to scramble together English coursework (thousands of words, I can’t remember how many exactly) due in March. I am worried about this, and I am worried about exams in June and I am worried about another whole year of work until I finally get to my goal: UNIVERSITY. 
I just can’t cope well with huge amounts of work or engagements or activity without getting ridiculously tired or stressed. I am so fed up with it. I don’t want to be one of those people anymore. I don’t want stress. I want to be able to get on with my life.
Thing is, I don’t know whether it’s a reflection of my current mental state or whether it’s just my character. And even so, my current mental state isn’t that bad. I keep on trying to un-wrinkle my forehead and drop my shoulders and relaxxxxx.
My therapist says that my brain has been conditioned to tense up and that I have to re-train it. I can’t re-train it in a day or even a week. But even re-training can be stressful&#8212it means I’ve always got to have some kind of consciousness about how relaxed I am! 
So January has been quite anxious, but that’s a natural reaction to actually doing stuff I want to do. 
I think university is what I want at the end of all this. I really, really love learning. Knowledge is one of my favourite pleasures in life. I don’t mean equations or memorising French verbs, but knowledge I can actually apply to my life and pop culture, man. People shouldn’t underestimate this&#8212shout out to Anne Helen Petersen who writes the best pieces on the Hairpin. I love making connections between everything. The other night my mind was going on a connection spree, you know Hamlet →Nirvana →Sylvia Plath →e.e. cummings →Bon Iver. Those kinds of connections. It’s the grading scheme that I don’t appreciate. It’s the competition. I am so fed up with being competitive! Come on society, sort it out.
I think often “What the hell am I doing?!” and I realise: I don’t need to know right now. I can just enjoy the things I enjoy without being so hard on myself about how good I am. I can experiment and dip my toe into everything that intrigues me and Future Me can figure it out (fingers crossed). ♦

I’ve been thinking and trying to figure out how to express what has happened to me this week; it feels like it has contained more than seven days’ worth of experiences. It’s been a little overwhelming.
Let me start here: as you might have gathered, if you’ve been reading my diary these past five months, I’ve been dealing, for a long time, with a lot of fears and restrictions. It’s been hard for me to venture very far from my house. New experiences tend to frighten me. I get anxious easily; I fall into depressions with ease.
Well, Friday I actually went to two places that I hadn’t been to for over a year! They were just two stores, and I know that to most people that sounds like no big deal at ALL, but for someone like me, it was really hard. I have agoraphobia, even though I’ve been reluctant to say so out loud, at least here on Rookie, because I get embarrassed about it. Staying close to home was, for a long time, a coping method to deal with my anxiety. I’ve been breaking myself of that habit slowly over the past year, with walks around my neighborhood and to the library and to my best friend’s house, and volunteering in the church office, answering the phones and things.
I have a lot more to say about this and will someday, but I feel like I want to wait until it’s more definitely behind me, when my feeling so trapped is a distant memory. Plus, like I said, I’m still a little embarrassed and ashamed about it. I’m also scared. Scared of life! But I think fear is a sign that something’s changing, and that’s good. Let’s dance.
Naomi
For so long I’ve been living with this thing. This thing that was casually described as “Naomi finds it hard to go out.” I don’t know why this was the case. I don’t know why it kept getting worse, or why it started to get better. Or how this thing has hindered me, and in some ways helped me.
What it felt like was this: my mind and body were weighed down, and every molecule of me was screaming at me not to go places, not to leave my comfort zone. Something that I couldn’t see or describe was blocking me, 24/7, from the outside world. Eventually I started to call it an “invisible wall.” Once I identified it as such, it had a shape in my head, and I could smash through it.
It was hard for me to do things that I was not comfortable with. That’s the definition of comfort, isn’t it? Things that are not hard to do. Thinking about going to school, or even just riding in a car, started to give me panic attacks. Then I started being anxious about the panic attacks themselves—a vicious cycle that could only be avoided by not considering leaving home in the first place. So I stopped considering it.
The less you do anything, the harder it gets to do. Ultimately, it was easier to stop fighting my urge to stay home all the time. But then, one day, that began to change.
Last year was the unhappiest period of my life. It’s when I really saw clearly all of my limitations, how deep the hole was that I had dug myself into. But I was so tired. Too tired and lacking in motivation to do anything to change my situation. I gave up before I really did anything at all.
So I regrouped, and decided that instead of trying to act differently, I would first focus on feeling better. I had been so sad for so long, and nothing was fun—I worked on alleviating my depression before I worked on leaving the house. Then when I did leave, I didn’t try to go far. I took small walks right near the vicarage where we live, then I started going to the nearby library, and those things felt good, and safe, and I stuck with those for a long time before venturing farther.
In some ways agoraphobia is just another destructive habit, like smoking, or cutting, or procrastinating. You know you are not helping yourself by staying home again, but you do it anyway. You know that you are making everything harder for yourself, but that doesn’t matter, because right now you are choosing instant gratification, where the anxiety decreases and you think that makes it the right decision. And that is what is important. You are blinded to most other things.
I don’t think I am blinded anymore. I think I actually want to go places. I don’t want to miss out any longer. I don’t want to hate myself every time I realize I can’t go somewhere. I don’t want to let the people I love down anymore. I think there is only so long you can live with something like that. It’s a continuing thing, though, with no clear beginning or end. ♦

So Mum had reminded me that there was an open house at a school just around the corner. My anxiety hasn’t allowed me to go to school full time since 2008. I’ve been teaching myself at home, through a distance-learning program. But lately my fears haven’t been quite so strong, and I’ve been thinking about enrolling in a proper high school to finish my senior year. 
Before my parents and I went to the open house, I was pacing back and forth, shouting, and making up songs to release my anxiety. It was cold when we left the house, and I could see my breath—a good sign; it meant I was still breathing. 
When we got to the school, my heart was in my mouth. I managed to get out of the car without collapsing into a heap and melting into the snow. But then! The entrance.
I walked through the automatic doors and then almost immediately walked out again, praying that no one had seen me. They had people at the doors to welcome me. Students! And they were wearing matching T-shirts. The HORROR. I personally detest this added barrier to getting into a building. 
So I half felt like a failure already, but I collected myself, trying to freeze the panic out of my brain. I observed my breath coming out in clouds. For a moment, the gaggle of students seemed to have passed, so we took our chance and bolted in. I was all right because we were inside and I had gotten over the threshold. Sometimes that is the hardest bit.
Walking, like breathing, is good for me. It helps me come to terms with where I am. As we walked around, I could actually observe the niceness of the building. For some reason, me and my mum had the impression that it was a little grotty, but it wasn’t at all. The English teacher spoke to me like he wanted to start teaching me already. He mentioned feminism! And Twilight! And he seemed happy that the latter didn’t really align with my feminist principles! The library was heavenly&#8212an actual, proper library. At my old school, it had been the size of about two classrooms, and there was never a computer free, and there was this strange hedgehog-like librarian. The geography teacher noticed my Clash T-shirt and talked about Bruce Springsteen, of all things. 
We all left on a high. I never thought that I could have a genuinely nice experience in a school ever again. In fact, I think my last school had left me with a phobia of institutions in general. But this time, it didn’t feel like “school”&#8212as in a place where every pupil is actually just a grade on a piece of paper. It felt like a place where I would be treated as a young adult, a person who I am starting to feel like more and more. ♦

I’ve already had my little New Year crisis and gotten over it, so I haven’t got much to write about today. It seemed like I had an avalanche of anxiety on the first day of the year but I naturally let most of it go, just as it naturally came. It’s nice to confront a hill and then climb over it and be done with it (through lots and lots of writing in my private diary and walks and guitar strumming, etc.). In the early hours of the morning, I had a conversation with myself (in my head–I am not that crazy yet):
“Why is life going to be so hard?”
“It doesn’t have to be hard.”
“Wait…what did you just say?!?!”
(I’ll get back to you on this particular theory.)
What I am reminded of at the moment is what my therapist said to me a few weeks ago. Part of the battle in anything, she said, is overcoming self-hate and self-doubt. She said that I am slowly rebuilding my house after it got knocked down, and I am taking extra care and attention with the foundation. Other people may build their house right up again but then it will get knocked over at the first instance.
For several years now I’ve been struggling with anxiety, chronic fatigue, and depression. I’ve had therapy for about two and a half years. I think it’s helped, slowly, but it certainly doesn’t turn your life around in one day. Sometimes it is just nice to talk to someone who isn’t a family member or a friend, because they are completely impartial. 
From an outsider’s point of view, it may not seem very impressive what I’m doing, because perhaps you can’t see it as well as if I had just built my house up in a hurry, just for people to admire. But it just means that when I am ready, the building of a beautiful, beautiful house (it will be beautiful) will be a bit smoother because I will have a made a solid base so that if a strong wind comes along, it may shake a little but it will still be standing.
I may not be entering the new year with anything to show people in terms of progress. I have no paper evidence of what I’ve been working on in 2011, and other people may not be able to see a thing. But my goals, struggles, and changes have never synched themselves with the turning of the years, or months, or days. They are slow, gradual, constant, and lasting. ♦

Last week, I talked very briefly about the private diary I’ve been writing since I was 13. We’ve been talking about journals on the Rookie Tumblr, too, so I thought: why not show a little tiny peek into mine?

This is an example from late at night, the gap between waking and sleeping. It’s a limbo that I quite enjoy falling into. Feelings can be quite intense then and that’s nice, except you can’t really do anything with them, because your mind is like, “I need to go to sleep!” I don’t know how to keep these moments from slipping through my fingers.
When I woke up the next morning, I wondered whether I had actually dreamed it. My head was full of city lights and lace exhibitions and daffodils and pavements and train journeys and photos and my auntie’s house in London and all of the things that I think I deserve to do. Sometimes, I still have a childlike wonder for all these things I actually can do. ♦

I suppose in my head I’ve always though putting good things into life = getting good things out of it. An old-fashioned idea, maybe. This week it seems it’s an idea that doesn’t work. I hate it because this time last week, how dreamy I was feeling, and how lovely it was to feel dreamy again. I was in a blissful state of mind, a trance semi-induced by Bon Iver. Contrast that with now, when I feel a bitterness and a hanging cloud overhead and I am feeling too lacklustre to listen to any music at all.
I don’t get it. I think I am beginning to get life figured out and then it makes a U-turn. Friday I suddenly woke up with that old familiar tiredness—I was so heavy, and everything I did had a slowed-down effort to it, the opposite of that dreamy airiness feeling from the rest of the week.
For some reason, I was determined to make muffins. I can’t remember the last time I baked anything. Maybe two years ago? Then I discovered we had no flour and almost had a meltdown. I felt so fragile, I could have been knocked over by a feather. It was cold (I love the cold), and it was sunny (I love the sunshine), but I did not feel happy or invigorated. I just felt…tired. But there was that flour to get, and I figured I’d feel better if I got it. So I grabbed my coat and purse and somehow made it out the back gate. On a day like that, that was an accomplishment in itself. I made it to the shop and found the flour. My heart was beating so fast as I waited in line. I thought I was going to either faint or run out and back home as quickly as possible, or horrible things would escape every orifice, or my insides were completely going to collapse. So I left the line and stared intently at some bananas. The guy working there must have walked past wondering why this pale girl was so angry at these bananas.
Well, guess what, I made it. I held on to that bag of flour for dear life. Clutched it as if it were proof of my being well, my being OK. I don’t mind telling you that the day went progressively downhill after that. I also don’t mind telling you that I survived, as I always do.
I’m not sure why I am entombing these last few couple of days like I want to remember them, because I sincerely don’t. Maybe I need proof that I have survived and that though there will be bad moments in the future, there will, over time, be more good days. I still feel crap, but there is always tomorrow. Please join me in asking the universe and my body to be a bit more kind to me.

Every time I watch Lost in Translation (which I do a couple of times a year), this scene stuns me. Finding it on YouTube meant I got to reflect on the fact it is only three minutes long, when it feels so much longer than that in the film.
There’s this part, too, from Marie Antoinette.
What I love about those two scenes is the sense of being still—of being allowed to be peaceful but still having a will to explore (or to just sit back and stare). And I love all the lingering shots of nature. I can’t underestimate how healing it is for me to be in, or just contemplate, the outside world. Basically this combination—exploration, nature, and peaceful contemplation—is what I want for my life.
What that will look like, though, I haven’t figured out yet. I’d like to explore other cities and countries. I’d also like to find somewhere on the edge of the countryside where I can settle and be idle. Sometimes I hate living in such a sleepy little town, but there are moments (usually around sunset, for some reason) when I feel really content here, because I can be alone and focus on feeling instead of thinking all the time. I love moments like these. I wish I could explain them to people, but I’m not articulate enough. Instead I supposed I can just tell them to watch all of Sofia Coppola’s films. She gets me.
I can’t wait to be on trains and airplanes again. ♦
