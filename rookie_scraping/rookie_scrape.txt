I’ve just started to binge watch Gilmore Girls and I’m such a Lane Kim! I’m awkward, a fantasist, and I can be more invested in others’ lives than in my own. Lane is actually one of my favorite characters because I relate to her, especially with the weird hair-touching of Rich Bloomenfeld (of Season One, Episode Eight). I feel like that is something I’d probably do in that situation, cause I’m just as creepy. 
On another note, I went to an eye appointment a few days ago and the lady who served me described the glasses I chose as “hideous.” I was too sad to say anything, so I just sat there looking at the floor. The thing that made me really insecure, though, was that the glasses I chose are almost identical to the pair I already wear (they’re the glasses that Bill Haverchuck wears in Freaks and Geeks). I started wondering, Do I look hideous? I felt so low about the situation that I posted a small paragraph about it on my Instagram story and soon after, I checked my direct messages and a girl sent me a really kind message telling me that my glasses give me clarity and to have a good day. I messaged her back thanking her, and told her that I was sending positive vibes her way. 
It made me really happy that someone I’ve never met before could reassure me about something that was bothering me a lot. It felt good to know that there are always people looking out for me, no matter how far away they are. ♦

I am relocated to a new corner of the house now, a new room for me to paint whatever teenage angst there is left of me. In the first days of sleeping there, I noticed faint traces of strange scents, probably dried-up cement or a leprechaun under my bed? And then, two days ago, I came down with a cold. But, in the quiet halo I spend lying on my bed most afternoons when class is still three hours away, I come back to that space and yearn to get a hold of the dappled sun dancing across the sheets and onto my face.
Good news from the front: As I was rummaging through two boxes and a trash bag repurposed to store books, I found a copy of The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer. I remembered unearthing this book from a box left behind by a guest in our house when I was in third grade, and reading it secretly when no one was watching, either because I was too young to understand the mildly erotic scene on page 37, or because I liked the thrill of having something secret to myself, and to myself alone. This spurred me on to writing diaries, even asking an aunt to get me a nice notebook with a lock on it for Christmas. Glad to remember this li’l history of my li’l life. Thank you to Jennifer and David Lynch, and to Laura Palmer, I guess?
Ooh, I almost forgot! Coldplay is coming to my country the summer of next year. I was so excited, I’ve been saving up for ticket and airfare for MONTHS. Then, the event promoters declared the tickets sold-out while I was still in the friggin line to get one! What do I even make of this? What’s a girl gotta do to see a bunch of guys who have created music that saved her a whole lot of times? Cry, I guess. ♦

I remember the moment I became uncomfortable with my skin. I was in fourth grade and I realized that I had small black dots in the weird flap of skin under my lips and above my chin. I found that if I jutted out my teeth out far enough, and pulled my bottom lip back, I could pick at these dark bumps, which my mother told me were blackheads. I would probably have perfect skin right now if she’d never introduced me to Biore Porestrips and extraction tools and squeezing.
I was always cognizant of my protruding stomach. I spent a lot of time staring at it, very hard. It was the result of being a perpetually constipated child with a penchant for Annie’s Mac and Cheese. One day, also in fourth grade, I stayed home from school, afflicted with nausea. I couldn’t hold down food or water, and I’d exiled any bile left in my system. I looked in the mirror. My stomach was flat. This is how I had to look. This was good. But my arms were kind of big, and my thighs touched at the top. I spent the rest of the day following Exercise TV routines on demand. 
Much later, in eighth grade, I found out that dress underlined intent. My style had always been simple and comfortable. Leggings or jeggings, an oversized graphic tee, and a jacket from my father’s arsenal. Interests could be expressed through T-shirt design, and flavor injected by shoe choice. But girls were supposed to wear things that made their butts look good. Butts mattered. Girls taught me that. So my shirts became smaller, and the flannels came off. Except I forgot an important step. 
Two boys were over—one a raging (but sometimes helpful) narcissist who got off on humiliating me, the other his equally cruel (but quieter) friend. Of course, I wanted to kiss both. Ultimately, I realized that the sidekick was far more attainable than the lead, and thus, I devised my plan. We three sat in my living room, in addition to one of my more finely-tuned female friends who’d agreed to aid in logistics. After a brief make-out session between Lead and my friend, Sidekick asked for water. I got up to get it for him. I suppose he and Lead watched me walk out of the room, because shortly after I received I text from Lead. He said I should fix my underwear, Sidekick could see it. “Were they too small?” he pondered. I pulled out a wedgie and headed back to the sofa, inching in closer to the boy I so desperately yearned to kiss. I still see it, Lead noted, this time aloud. I bolted upstairs, quickly, as to ensure no one could pay attention to my butt, searching for a pair of panties that couldn’t be seen through leggings. But I was 13, and I had no thongs, and I hadn’t even considered that thongs were a thing I could or should own. And what were cheekies? I only knew of Jockey.
I didn’t kiss Sidekick. The next day, my savvy friend brought over three thongs she’d stolen from her Grandma. ♦

“Grab her by the pussy.” The second I am lifted up by my crotch from behind in the pit and held above the swarm of heads, Trump’s words fly into my mind. It is strange, because I have blocked him from my personal life save for a short article or two in the morning, and now here he is, holding me in the pit. The man slams me down, then grabs me by the crotch again and repeats the motion. If he had done it in any other way—grabbed my waist, grabbed my torso, anything—I would have loved it. It would’ve been the most exciting moment of the show. But because I can still feel the warmth of his hand down there, like the heat of a slap, I cover my mouth and I run out of the room full of people I know and don’t know but still either respect or want to respect me. It is the most embarrassing moment of the show, if not my life; they do not know what has transpired. They think that I am running from the pain that is a norm here, not the sting of experiencing something that I can only eloquently describe as “fucked.” 
I have only one friend here, and she is drunk, plus she didn’t witness the event. I find a mutual “friend” of ours, someone I dislike but have been friendly with in the past. I tell him of my humiliation, but still I cannot get the words out to explain why I ran. I give excuses. He is disappointed. “That’s just the kind of thing that happens here, you know? You have to be prepared for it.” I wish I could backhand him with the privilege that he has just spit into my face. I wish I could vomit out my stress and not have it be decried “SJW drivel” or the inner working of yet another fragile teen girl. I am angry with myself for running out. I wish I had stayed and fought my battle the way they are all fought here, the way I usually do it. I wish I hadn’t failed “fight or flight” in such a spectacular way, so unlike myself. 
But I also…..I also wish that I didn’t have to justify the actions of a grown man who knew where he was touching me and went out of his way to do it simply because I was swimming at the core of aggression. Does being purely in touch with your anger mean you must go out of your way to violate another? Funny, because most people would say that that is the main concept behind moshing, but I think there is a difference between violence and sexualized/sexual violence. This is not to say that I was assaulted, but there was a sexual element the minute he grabbed me and it stained. A punch to my head? Great. Swallowing my genitalia in a tight palm grip? I felt him throughout the rest of the show, below all the cuts on my face and the open wound on my elbow and the cracking of my joints. I feel him when I remember how stupid I was for running, and then when I remember that I was in shock, and that it was fine of me to be in shock. 
I didn’t grab back. That was my greatest loss. ♦

Red, the colour of her lips when you kiss them.
Red, the colour of my cheeks when she told me she loved me.
Red hair and red hearts.
Red daggers going into red hearts.
Red hearts broken.

Red, what I saw when you told me I was no longer enough.
Red lipstick stains on shirt collars.
Red, hot, deep burning desire.
Red fingernails scratching my skin, tearing into me, drawing

Red goodbyes.

Last weekend, I chose to buckle down and stay in my room to complete my homework in a timely manner, and avoid having a panic attack like I usually do when I let my deadlines pile up until the night before they’re due. As a result, I handed in 94 percent of my assignments on time. I was proud of myself, although it isn’t a grand achievement, I guess—I’m supposed to get assignments in on time. But baby steps, right? 
I felt so responsible and productive. I finally get why people start assignments days or weeks before their deadlines. In the past, I struggled with that strategy because I thought I had to have everything ready when I began a project. The pressure of coming up with an idea, establishing key points, and then executing it all in one sitting is too much pressure for my fragile, anxious brain. Now I see that starting early doesn’t mean you have to have a concrete idea when you start. Putting your name down and preparing a few notes for a project may seem like you’ve only done 1/16 of the work, but throwing together those vague aspects of an assignment in its earlier stages gives you the free time to think about it more deeply when you’re doing something else. 
Procrastination is something I’ve always battled, and often lost to, but this week showed me that I can be a productive person who has her shit (relatively) together. Also, getting assignments in on time or earlier leaves you with so much time for yourself; why have I been denying myself the joys that come with being a punctual and efficient human? Being on time makes life so much easier. I’m gonna try to keep this going. ♦

I submit my early-decision college application and my entries to a poetry contest on consecutive days. The victories come with more waiting, and a curse. I have forgone a lot of my duties to focus on the ED app, but I am feeling some of the best feelings—inklings I never even conceived of until they latched onto me recently. I believe in myself enough that I know I will be able to fix everything that has been fractured in my life, recent things and a few guest issues from the past. I am proud of myself. And I know my mother would be too. 
I begin writing poetry again. Everything new that I feel makes me tremble, in a way that, for perhaps the first time in my life, makes me want to never leave my house. A kind of stasis but I can see the action—how do I feel it?

I love public libraries. 
It seems many people have forgotten about libraries, rarely entering one unless it’s attached to a university campus. When I was a kid, going to the library was part of my weekly routine, I would borrow two books and a DVD every time. I’d spend hours trying to decide what to read next, and then go to the corner shop opposite and buy a pack of sweets. I would sit with my mom in a church graveyard, with our bags full of books and stuffing the sugary goodness into our mouths. 
Your local library might be a pint-sized hole in the wall or a deluxe reading haven. Either way you’ll find a hidden gem. Hide Post-It notes in the pages of a novel, find your favorite reading nook, or ask your librarian for a recommendation. ♦

My roommate says, “What are you looking at?” I jerk in my seat and glance back at her. She says, “You’ve been staring out the window for a while.”
I have no recollection of time passing. I make some meaningless affirmative noise and smile, although I’m sure it looks more like a grimace. The notes I should be studying still sit on my desk, pristine, untouched.
I am happier than I was before I came here. That much is obvious. My mother could tell just by looking at me when she visited me last month. I don’t struggle with managing my time nearly as much as I did in high school; I don’t pick ceaselessly at the skin of my wrists and bite my fingernails raw like I did last summer; I don’t lose time floating in that interminable blankness that was at once a prison and a refuge at my lowest points. Or at least, these are all much rarer than they used to be.
But we all have our days—Sundays tend to be my hardest. Scene: my friends, gleeful over a day free of classes; the commons and main quad, dotted with groups of people studying happily in the unusually warm autumn sun; me, in bed with the blinds drawn, unable to focus, unable to move. Classes start again tomorrow, I tell myself, I am almost there, just let this day pass. I need something to engage with, intellectually, something that will challenge me, but I can’t concentrate on my actual schoolwork, so I sleep, hoping to dream. When that fails, I sit in bed wrapped in blankets and stare ceaselessly without realizing and unnerve my roommate. I am an adult, I turned 18 last week, I can get beyond this. Things will be better so soon. Tomorrow morning. The skin around the beds of my fingernails is cracked, bleeding, but I don’t look at it. It’s just because it’s dry, I tell myself, because winter is coming. I am not who I was last summer. It’s just because it’s dry. ♦

I’d rather not talk about things that make me uncomfortable. Topics and experiences that force me to think about things I’d rather not make me feel like I’ve been hit in the stomach with a baseball. I avoid these types of conversations similarly to how I avoid my homework—until I can’t anymore.
My past is a pathway of things I’m trying to forget and those I’m clutching to. Memories come in waves that make me grateful for the shore that is the present. Although I sometimes want to dive back into the complicated waters and let them take me under, I’ve decided the unstable sand is a safer place to stay. 
“What was your childhood like?” asks a survey we are taking for psychology class. 
Sometimes I can’t answer that question. Other times, I can think back to bike rides and trips to McDonalds with my siblings and grandma after church every Sunday. Yet all those flashbacks are silent films with a distorted voiceover. I can hear yelling, fighting, and unhappy times. 
If there was any way for me to go back in time and fix everything I would.
“What would I be willing to sacrifice to go back and make everything better?” A lot. The list has made me question what makes me happy. 
I try not to think about it; there’s no way to go back and although the present isn’t the best, at least it’s not the past. ♦

Interesting thought from a boy: “I heard through the grapevine…god wears a dunce hat.”
Midway through my checkup at a new doctor’s office, I lock myself in the bathroom, take a picture with my urine sample and write: “I never want another male doctor’s hand on my body again. I don’t need to see his wedding band on my left thigh or listen to his laugh as he grabs my kidney through my skin. I don’t need his heavy breathing prefacing his anxious speech about how I shouldn’t worry because I’ll ‘fill out one day.’ I want to strangle you with your caduceus, Herr Doktor. I want to step on all ten of your toes and ask you if it hurts yet. #doctorgate2k16”

Around this time last year I was crawling my way out of a stupid, abusive, and unwanted “situationship.” I had to break things off twice, because the person guilted me into staying the first time. Oh, that first time. I called them, after once again being admonished for not texting them as much as they’d like. I said something along the lines of, “I don’t think I can do this, I’m depressed and I need to work on finding myself again. I’m not at a place where I can give you what you want.” In truth, that excuse only made up 40 percent of my reasoning for bringing our death-on-arrival go at a relationship to a halt. The other 60 percent was that their constant critique of my looks and interests made me miserable, and had me questioning my self-worth. They would insult major aspects of my identity, yet become sad and make themselves out to be the victim whenever I hinted at wanting to leave. 
I wanted to explain this that day, but they were pretty narcissistic and mean in a way that made them incapable self-reflection or seeing how their actions might negatively affect someone else. I envisioned them shit-talking me over the phone, telling me I had no right to tell them that they weren’t a great mate when there were so many things they didn’t like about me, but had put up with for the sake of building (their version of) a relationship. It was always “you’re the one who doesn’t give me the attention I want.” “Why don’t you do your hair like this?” “You’re the one ruining the relationship we could have.” It never crossed their mind that maybe I unconsciously wasn’t giving them the attention they craved because they were always putting me down. 
Writing this now, I see how manipulative and abusive their words and actions were. Whether they knew it or not, they were instilling this, “you need to stay with me because if you don’t you wasted my time and that makes you a bad person, plus no one else will like you the way I do” mantra in my head. They thought they were the heroic protagonist in a story, when really they were the wicked antagonist—but they were too full of themselves to see it. 
Is is really so bad, lying to someone about why you’re leaving them because you’re afraid they’ll bite back by listing everything they hate about you and have ignored for the sake of their unrealistic and abusive dream of being in a “real relationship”? If I was as “nonchalant” and unappealing as they said I was, why didn’t they leave or let me leave? I wanted to avoid having my feelings hurt for the 1000th time. They never really liked me. They just took interest in me; looking down on me as this depressed, angry, motherless girl who they wanted to “take care of.” It turned out that as soon as I broke it off I realized it was them who was making me depressed. 
This person had me doubting my entire being and self-esteem, Am I a bad person for liking space? Am I some type of emotionless, cold-hearted freak for preferring to build a close friendship with someone before we start dating? Those questions rang through my head for months. I was essentially asking, Does being who I am, and doing what’s best for me make me a bad person? Today, I’m so happy to be able to to say, no! Preferring to take things slow and like the things that I like does not make me a stoic bitch. I’m not an immoral deviant who lacks empathy because I appreciate having space. 
They would often say, “Thahabu we are working on a relationship.” What is this working? Is a relationship a a job? A relationship shouldn’t feel like a job, or, I don’t want it to. For me, if you have to work on a relationship before it’s even started it obviously sucks. People say that romantic heartbreak shapes you, that you become more seasoned and mature. That situation didn’t leave me heartbroken, what it almost did was break me. It didn’t shape me lead me toward some mind-boggling revelation. It excavated everything about me that I thought of as good and honest, and framed it as disgusting and heartless. 
It still shocks me that someone bullied me throughout a relationship, then vilified me for wanting to leave them. In their eyes, I guess I wasn’t supposed to like myself because they didn’t like me. ♦

Yesterday, I put an end to my constant moaning and complaining, and actually followed through with my plans and hung out with my friends. 
We went to a shopping centre: I bought a few vinyls and CDs, and they bought clothes. I had a great time. I feel really proud of myself for initiating the trip, especially given my huge fear of rejection. Everything turned out OK, and I can say that it was one of the first times where I actually felt “normal.” I kind of felt like the first Claire from My Wife and Kids who is always at the mall with her friends, and goes through the typical, trivial, teenage girl situations, like having to go bra shopping with her dad. 
I’d been moping around in my bedroom feeling so lonely, but all it took to make plans with my friends was simply asking them. If you want something in this life, you have to be clear. Although they don’t have the exact same interests as me, they’re nice, and that’s really all I can ask for. I would be asking for too much if I wanted to find a whole group of friends who listen to Frank Sinatra and who watch Wes Anderson movies. Now that I think about it, that’d be a long shot. 
I’m glad that I’m finally fulfilling my Dazed and Confused teenage dreams, and that they can coexist with my awkward personality, which is very similar to Mia Thermopolis’ from The Princess Diaries. I’m completely OK with that. ♦

To me, 17 sounds older than 18, mostly because odd numbers are typically “edgier” than even ones. (Side note: I really do not want to be 19 next year, because 19 is an absolutely gross number.)
I am 18 now. My childhood is not technically over until I leave for college, which leaves a lot of time left for kid-ish stupidity, but I must admit, a very youthful part of me died on Tuesday night.
I watched my country—which mind you, I never necessarily believed in or ever thought to be above prejudice—make the decision to elect the guy who played Waldo’s dad in The Little Rascals President. Hours before, I had very confidently proclaimed to my friends that I never foresaw a Republican President taking office again in my lifetime, because the party was disjointed, and the liberal public was simply savvier. I was so sure.
As a child, there are these feelings of certainty in everything surrounding you. Your house will always be your house, your cat will never die, your grandpa will never be diagnosed with cancer, Oprah Winfrey will never cease to provide you after-school self-help. In context, these assumptions seem logical, because your understanding of time is incomplete. Knowing this, and having grown up, I thought I had come to terms with random change. I hadn’t.
What I thought I knew was not the truth. That’s a very hard lesson to learn. And, to add another layer to this muddled disaster of uncertainty, despite what I’d been taught before, being a legal adult isn’t making it any easier to learn. ♦

She smelled like perfume and tobacco, this sweet musky aftertaste that was left when we said goodbye. I have a type, and going out with her definitely went against that. I like chubby, posh femme girls who wear puffy dresses and too much lipstick and pronounce my name like I am an endangered species. 
She carried muscle like I store fat and spoke as though she had seen it all. She touched me like life depended on it. And in that moment it did.
We didn’t kiss, even though she tried and I wanted to, because I like girls with long hair, dinner bells, and ball gowns and she hasn’t worn a dress in 10 years. She doesn’t know about spilled milk and maybe I should stop expecting people to have had the same life as me, but I have tea parties and she has never even had lunch.
And yet here I am, thinking about her, again and again. ♦

I’m happy to be nearing the end of my semester. It’s been a trying time, mentally. It’s so crazy, to lose a friend some years back would’ve been this dramatic ordeal. Today, here I am relieved to let go of the empty baggage. If I’m not standing to gain anything in our friendship but I’m giving so much, then why am I keeping you around? I feel, for the first time in my life, that I’m stepping into my own as an adult woman. More and more every day, I’m shaping myself into the person I want to be and surrounding myself with people who want to uplift me. The black women who took me under their wing when I came onto this campus have continued to extend themselves. I’m going to miss them terribly when they’re gone. I understand the importance of having an advocate and forging a community in seemingly impossible circumstances, a sentiment that’ll only increase in Donald Trump’s America. I haven’t begun to speak on that, as I’m still in shock and denial! Until then… ♦

School has been really overwhelming lately, I’ve had so many assignments and tests to study for. Amidst my stress I watched the Karate Kid movies and Mr. Miyagi says that balance is an essential in life, so I figured I should stop panicking and take more breaks during my study sessions. It’s funny, once I started thinking like this, I felt like I was on track with my work and it reassured me. I panicked less and stopped letting my mental health deteriorate. 
Last week, something happened to me in school that made me extremely angry. I was in Religious Education class and in the textbook for Christian beliefs there was a section in the chapter on suffering that mentioned the Charleston massacre. 
I said to my friend who was sitting opposite me, “I really hate these stories, they make me really upset.” 
“But there is nothing you can do about it,” she replied. 
In my head I was thinking, Well, gun laws could be changed, we should recognize and change the way police treat people of colour in comparison to how they treat white people, and we could call the murderer who committed the massacre a terrorist rather than avoiding the label because he’s white. But I didn’t say anything because I felt slightly afraid at the thought of confronting her. Instead, I said, “Isn’t that the guy who was given Burger King?“ She cut me off immediately: “The police had to do that so that he would confess.” I sat in my chair thinking, So, you don’t recognize the difference between the treatment of white people and black people by the police? Don’t you realize that black people are murdered by the police, in front of their families, for simply putting their hands up?
It really upset me that she thought there was nothing we could’ve done to stop that racist murderer from killing multiple black people. There are, in fact, many things to be done. By the time I die, I hope that I make at least one privileged person realize that we can always do something, no matter how minor it may seem, to effect change. ♦

“Oh, look at that. Fascinating,” he says.
“And the offset,” I say, “could that have been caused by the impact that led to the axial tilt? A redistribution of the mass—there are moons like that—”
“I would counter that,” he muses, “by drawing attention to how similar the B-fields are. Since the planets themselves are so alike—”
It’s not a situation I could have imagined myself in two months ago, but here I am in my astronomy professor’s office, meant to be discussing my class schedule for next semester and instead debating the significance of Uranus and Neptune’s particularly weird magnetic fields. When I eventually trade places with the next student he’s advising I hear him say “Come in. Oh, Lilly and I were just talking about—” and it’s a little surreal, to finally have someone I can have those conversations with. It’s a little odd, too, awkward. He’s my professor, not my peer. (I get incredibly self-conscious about how often I say “um.”) But in the end, we’re just two people who care about the same thing and I feel emboldened by his willingness to listen, to address my questions without condescension.

I hope not. At my roommate’s request I lay siege to the crank that supposedly operates the central heating in our dorm room until something creaks and bubbles and warm air gushes forth. On my numb fingers it feels like a fountain of youth.

Packing to go home is difficult. I brought a subset of my belongings with me when I came here, and now I am bringing a smaller subset back. My bag ends up light: a pair of jeans, a few T-shirts, a flannel, enough socks and underwear to last the week.
I’ve felt lost at times while I’m here, but in the end I do feel like I belong. It just doesn’t feel like home—it feels like summer camp, like I’ve barely been here a week. At the same time, I can’t figure out when meandering solo across campus and trudging up the stairs to my room became so routine, so ordinary that I don’t bat an eye at the thought of living on my own. I still call my parents every Sunday, but somewhere in the mix I think I’ve grown up. I just don’t know what that means yet. ♦

“Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.”
My greatest interest is learning. My favorite place to learn from is YouTube, where I watch videos about weird conspiracy theories. My favorite conspiracy theory concerns the Denver Airport, which a lot of people think was built by the New World Order. I don’t believe in the New World Order, but it’s kind of funny to pretend I do. Except sometimes, the evidence is so strong that I question whether it’s just irony guiding the hours I spend researching triangles.
My greatest talent is figuring out people’s ages. I think about years a lot. I know it’s just simple arithmetic, but I’m always thinking to myself, how old is someone born in 1986 right now? And the answer would be 30, unless they were born in December or late November, in which case they would be 29. But another person, let’s say they were born in 1945, well they would be 71, maybe still 70. It’s so interesting how time works. It’s different for everyone but it all works the same way. 
The most important thing colleges should know about me is that I am not a millennial. I strongly dislike being called a millennial. (I don’t use the word hate because I have a personal conviction that it is a strong word.) Millennial has such a negative connotation—not that there’s anything actually wrong with millennials, I’m just not one. A millennial is someone who didn’t have social media until they were a young adult. I was on Facebook in fifth grade. Therefore my generation needs a different name. I’d suggest iGeneration, in the vein of the generation-defining television show, iCarly. Oh, did I mention that when I grow up I want to write for TV, or other some kind of career involving similar skills and carrying the same social stigma. That’s why I have to go to college, so I can do that.
I hope you liked my essay and now understand that I am a unique student with her own thoughts and ideas. Please accept me. Please. Thank you. ♦

My class schedule for this academic semester is wild, shifting from two classes in the morning and two in the evening. Although at times I don’t quite know the relevance of taking up core courses (those totally unrelated to my major), I still find them fascinating, either because of professors who take to the heart what they’re teaching, or me feeling too young and inexperienced to boldly confine myself to one subject.
There was never any more inception than there is now,
Nor any more youth or age than there is now,
And will never be any more perfection than there is now,
Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.

On Friday, my country, the Philippines, failed to uphold its democracy by allowing the body of Ferdinand Marcos, a former dictator, to be buried in Libingan Ng Mga Bayani (Heroes’ Cemetery), 27 years after his death. (Prior to burial, the former dictator’s body was preserved in an air-conditioned crypt in his hometown in the northwest corner of the island of Luzon; if this isn’t creepy enough for you, then I don’t know what is.) The ceremony was done stealthily on Friday morning, with the public only knowing a few hours after. Many on the left took to social media, enraged, while those on the right asked for forgiveness without ever actually uttering the words. The Supreme Court of the Philippines ruled on the issue by allowing the burial, but due to numerous appeals and protests carried out by the anti-Marcos left, the issue wasn’t really given any closure. Thus was the public’s surprise when news of the burial spread. 
This has become a very sensitive issue in my country, and most people affected by Martial Law are still grieving over the pain and loss, 44 years later. I understand their pain and sympathize with them more than I understand those on the privileged side, those who enjoyed living on the misery of others, the people who felt entitled to forgiveness without sincere acknowledgment of their transgressions. The Marcos apologists demand that the issue be closed and quieted down now, but they should know that forgiveness doesn’t come easy, and nor does forgetting. That’s why even in death and in the grave, he is still considered a thief by the Filipino people.
To do: Retrace the lines of history and know exactly where the fault lines are; take notes and know that this could be repeated; prevent repetition of historical scars; uphold the sanctity of the land and the rights of its people under our democracy, no matter how stained by previous and present leaders. Do the actual important work of remembering, pondering, and fighting. ♦

My time at home is brief. I meet my brother’s boyfriend and visit family I have not seen since the summer. My cousins are all taller than me now, growing up in the literal sense. Sometimes I find myself hiding from them all, retreating to somewhere quiet, my mother my only pursuer. I tell her stories about physics that I’ve picked up from instructors along the way. It’s the only way to get them out of my head, crammed as it is with questions about extrasolar planets and magnetism and cosmology—relentless.
I meet a professor from the local university with coffee. For an hour or two he empties my head of those questions and fills it with new ones, about C++ and real analysis and elusive big data.
I fly back to school alone. I become precise, methodical again: unpack, get dinner, do laundry, do homework. I clean my half of the dorm rapidly, efficiently: scrub the sink, make the bed, stick up the posters that crawl off the wall every three days, put on music to drown out the commotion in the hallway as more people slink back to their rooms for the next three weeks. And it’s only three weeks: two of classes, one of exams. I have recommendation letters to request and essays to draft for research program applications. I have no time to be tired. I know this isn’t beyond me anymore. ♦

It’s cold! 
I’m inside and I still feel as though my hands are gonna fall off. The only time it’s OK to be this cold is when there is snow. The weather says it’s four degrees but I don’t believe it. I reckon we’re now in the minuses. 
Christmas is fast approaching. I have done the majority of my gift shopping, and I’m looking forward to giving them to the people I love. I’ve decided to make my ’net girlfriend and best friend “open when” boxes. These are boxes of letters and small tokens to be opened on certain dates, to coincide with specific events, or when feeling specific emotions. 
The Christmas tunes are being played constantly in the shops, and I can feel the excitement of the shoppers and the disdain of the folks who work there. Soon we’ll be getting cards through the letter box and seeing fairy lights in every window and eating and drinking twice as much, just because of the season. ♦

1. New York is leaking. This feels like something I would grasp from a Metro headline, ABC-7 Chyron, but I see it in the Union Square station and the flooded concrete banks of Lower East. Someone burst our bubble.
Woman is dancing with ties near the moving platform…woman is dead somewhere near my school, somewhere in one of the Heights, somewhere in the hole in my ceiling. I hear thumps in it at night that are louder than the subway. I tell myself to become one so they will not decry my languid body a foreign one to expel. 
On the train, woman in the corner jolts awake and vomits up an orange chunk duvet that just barely misses my right foot. I have not vomited on a train since age one but they purge me on occasion. 
1a. Something I just found out: The two primary definitions for “purge” are opposites within a whole same—
verb: rid (someone) of an unwanted feeling, memory, or condition, typically giving a sense of cathartic release. 
 noun: an abrupt or violent removal.
2. Some warm parallels: Discussing the fifth dimension (original concept accredited to Miranda July) with Tavi—when there exists a rift between a person’s general demeanor and how they exist in their art; heart attack realization during my daily show run that The Twilight Zone refers to the surreal region of that name as the fifth dimension. 
A friend asks me what my favorite number is—I tell him lucky 13 and he shows me the number in Roman numerals inked onto one of his fingers 
I have a dream in which one of my closest friends is walking alongside me with such a stressed expression that it stays with me when I wake up. I message them and they tell me that they had a dream in which the two of us are confronting their deathbed and traveling the circumference of their life’s roulette wheel until it leads us back to denouement. 
3. Mom’s death anniversary: 11/26. Mom’s birthday: 12/12. I always called it lucky. She was a lucky strike and I extinguished her. Never forgive me for it. ♦

Red, the colour of her lips when you kiss them.
Red, the colour of my cheeks when she told me she loved me.
Red hair and red hearts.
Red daggers going into red hearts.
Red hearts broken.

Red, what I saw when you told me I was no longer enough.
Red lipstick stains on shirt collars.
Red, hot, deep burning desire.
Red fingernails scratching my skin, tearing into me, drawing

Red goodbyes.
Red the ends.

Last weekend, I chose to buckle down and stay in my room to complete my homework in a timely manner, and avoid having a panic attack like I usually do when I let my deadlines pile up until the night before they’re due. As a result, I handed in 94 percent of my assignments on time. I was proud of myself, although it isn’t a grand achievement, I guess—I’m supposed to get assignments in on time. But baby steps, right? 
I felt so responsible and productive. I finally get why people start assignments days or weeks before their deadlines. In the past, I struggled with that strategy because I thought I had to have everything ready when I began a project. The pressure of coming up with an idea, establishing key points, and then executing it all in one sitting is too much pressure for my fragile, anxious brain. Now I see that starting early doesn’t mean you have to have a concrete idea when you start. Putting your name down and preparing a few notes for a project may seem like you’ve only done 1/16 of the work, but throwing together those vague aspects of an assignment in its earlier stages gives you the free time to think about it more deeply when you’re doing something else. 
Procrastination is something I’ve always battled, and often lost to, but this week showed me that I can be a productive person who has her shit (relatively) together. Also, getting assignments in on time or earlier leaves you with so much time for yourself; why have I been denying myself the joys that come with being a punctual and efficient human? Being on time makes life so much easier. I’m gonna try to keep this going. ♦

I submit my early-decision college application and my entries to a poetry contest on consecutive days. The victories come with more waiting, and a curse. I have forgone a lot of my duties to focus on the ED app, but I am feeling some of the best feelings—inklings I never even conceived of until they latched onto me recently. I believe in myself enough that I know I will be able to fix everything that has been fractured in my life, recent things and a few guest issues from the past. I am proud of myself. And I know my mother would be too. 
I begin writing poetry again. Everything new that I feel makes me tremble, in a way that, for perhaps the first time in my life, makes me want to never leave my house. A kind of stasis but I can see the action—how do I feel it?

I love public libraries. 
It seems many people have forgotten about libraries, rarely entering one unless it’s attached to a university campus. When I was a kid, going to the library was part of my weekly routine, I would borrow two books and a DVD every time. I’d spend hours trying to decide what to read next, and then go to the corner shop opposite and buy a pack of sweets. I would sit with my mom in a church graveyard, with our bags full of books and stuffing the sugary goodness into our mouths. 
Your local library might be a pint-sized hole in the wall or a deluxe reading haven. Either way you’ll find a hidden gem. Hide Post-It notes in the pages of a novel, find your favorite reading nook, or ask your librarian for a recommendation. ♦

My roommate says, “What are you looking at?” I jerk in my seat and glance back at her. She says, “You’ve been staring out the window for a while.”
I have no recollection of time passing. I make some meaningless affirmative noise and smile, although I’m sure it looks more like a grimace. The notes I should be studying still sit on my desk, pristine, untouched.
I am happier than I was before I came here. That much is obvious. My mother could tell just by looking at me when she visited me last month. I don’t struggle with managing my time nearly as much as I did in high school; I don’t pick ceaselessly at the skin of my wrists and bite my fingernails raw like I did last summer; I don’t lose time floating in that interminable blankness that was at once a prison and a refuge at my lowest points. Or at least, these are all much rarer than they used to be.
But we all have our days—Sundays tend to be my hardest. Scene: my friends, gleeful over a day free of classes; the commons and main quad, dotted with groups of people studying happily in the unusually warm autumn sun; me, in bed with the blinds drawn, unable to focus, unable to move. Classes start again tomorrow, I tell myself, I am almost there, just let this day pass. I need something to engage with, intellectually, something that will challenge me, but I can’t concentrate on my actual schoolwork, so I sleep, hoping to dream. When that fails, I sit in bed wrapped in blankets and stare ceaselessly without realizing and unnerve my roommate. I am an adult, I turned 18 last week, I can get beyond this. Things will be better so soon. Tomorrow morning. The skin around the beds of my fingernails is cracked, bleeding, but I don’t look at it. It’s just because it’s dry, I tell myself, because winter is coming. I am not who I was last summer. It’s just because it’s dry. ♦

I’d rather not talk about things that make me uncomfortable. Topics and experiences that force me to think about things I’d rather not make me feel like I’ve been hit in the stomach with a baseball. I avoid these types of conversations similarly to how I avoid my homework—until I can’t anymore.
My past is a pathway of things I’m trying to forget and those I’m clutching to. Memories come in waves that make me grateful for the shore that is the present. Although I sometimes want to dive back into the complicated waters and let them take me under, I’ve decided the unstable sand is a safer place to stay. 
“What was your childhood like?” asks a survey we are taking for psychology class. 
Sometimes I can’t answer that question. Other times, I can think back to bike rides and trips to McDonalds with my siblings and grandma after church every Sunday. Yet all those flashbacks are silent films with a distorted voiceover. I can hear yelling, fighting, and unhappy times. 
If there was any way for me to go back in time and fix everything I would.
“What would I be willing to sacrifice to go back and make everything better?” A lot. The list has made me question what makes me happy. 
I try not to think about it; there’s no way to go back and although the present isn’t the best, at least it’s not the past. ♦

Interesting thought from a boy: “I heard through the grapevine…god wears a dunce hat.”
Midway through my checkup at a new doctor’s office, I lock myself in the bathroom, take a picture with my urine sample and write: “I never want another male doctor’s hand on my body again. I don’t need to see his wedding band on my left thigh or listen to his laugh as he grabs my kidney through my skin. I don’t need his heavy breathing prefacing his anxious speech about how I shouldn’t worry because I’ll ‘fill out one day.’ I want to strangle you with your caduceus, Herr Doktor. I want to step on all ten of your toes and ask you if it hurts yet. #doctorgate2k16”

Around this time last year I was crawling my way out of a stupid, abusive, and unwanted “situationship.” I had to break things off twice, because the person guilted me into staying the first time. Oh, that first time. I called them, after once again being admonished for not texting them as much as they’d like. I said something along the lines of, “I don’t think I can do this, I’m depressed and I need to work on finding myself again. I’m not at a place where I can give you what you want.” In truth, that excuse only made up 40 percent of my reasoning for bringing our death-on-arrival go at a relationship to a halt. The other 60 percent was that their constant critique of my looks and interests made me miserable, and had me questioning my self-worth. They would insult major aspects of my identity, yet become sad and make themselves out to be the victim whenever I hinted at wanting to leave. 
I wanted to explain this that day, but they were pretty narcissistic and mean in a way that made them incapable self-reflection or seeing how their actions might negatively affect someone else. I envisioned them shit-talking me over the phone, telling me I had no right to tell them that they weren’t a great mate when there were so many things they didn’t like about me, but had put up with for the sake of building (their version of) a relationship. It was always “you’re the one who doesn’t give me the attention I want.” “Why don’t you do your hair like this?” “You’re the one ruining the relationship we could have.” It never crossed their mind that maybe I unconsciously wasn’t giving them the attention they craved because they were always putting me down. 
Writing this now, I see how manipulative and abusive their words and actions were. Whether they knew it or not, they were instilling this, “you need to stay with me because if you don’t you wasted my time and that makes you a bad person, plus no one else will like you the way I do” mantra in my head. They thought they were the heroic protagonist in a story, when really they were the wicked antagonist—but they were too full of themselves to see it. 
Is is really so bad, lying to someone about why you’re leaving them because you’re afraid they’ll bite back by listing everything they hate about you and have ignored for the sake of their unrealistic and abusive dream of being in a “real relationship”? If I was as “nonchalant” and unappealing as they said I was, why didn’t they leave or let me leave? I wanted to avoid having my feelings hurt for the 1000th time. They never really liked me. They just took interest in me; looking down on me as this depressed, angry, motherless girl who they wanted to “take care of.” It turned out that as soon as I broke it off I realized it was them who was making me depressed. 
This person had me doubting my entire being and self-esteem, Am I a bad person for liking space? Am I some type of emotionless, cold-hearted freak for preferring to build a close friendship with someone before we start dating? Those questions rang through my head for months. I was essentially asking, Does being who I am, and doing what’s best for me make me a bad person? Today, I’m so happy to be able to to say, no! Preferring to take things slow and like the things that I like does not make me a stoic bitch. I’m not an immoral deviant who lacks empathy because I appreciate having space. 
They would often say, “Thahabu we are working on a relationship.” What is this working? Is a relationship a a job? A relationship shouldn’t feel like a job, or, I don’t want it to. For me, if you have to work on a relationship before it’s even started it obviously sucks. People say that romantic heartbreak shapes you, that you become more seasoned and mature. That situation didn’t leave me heartbroken, what it almost did was break me. It didn’t shape me lead me toward some mind-boggling revelation. It excavated everything about me that I thought of as good and honest, and framed it as disgusting and heartless. 
It still shocks me that someone bullied me throughout a relationship, then vilified me for wanting to leave them. In their eyes, I guess I wasn’t supposed to like myself because they didn’t like me. ♦

Yesterday, I put an end to my constant moaning and complaining, and actually followed through with my plans and hung out with my friends. 
We went to a shopping centre: I bought a few vinyls and CDs, and they bought clothes. I had a great time. I feel really proud of myself for initiating the trip, especially given my huge fear of rejection. Everything turned out OK, and I can say that it was one of the first times where I actually felt “normal.” I kind of felt like the first Claire from My Wife and Kids who is always at the mall with her friends, and goes through the typical, trivial, teenage girl situations, like having to go bra shopping with her dad. 
I’d been moping around in my bedroom feeling so lonely, but all it took to make plans with my friends was simply asking them. If you want something in this life, you have to be clear. Although they don’t have the exact same interests as me, they’re nice, and that’s really all I can ask for. I would be asking for too much if I wanted to find a whole group of friends who listen to Frank Sinatra and who watch Wes Anderson movies. Now that I think about it, that’d be a long shot. 
I’m glad that I’m finally fulfilling my Dazed and Confused teenage dreams, and that they can coexist with my awkward personality, which is very similar to Mia Thermopolis’ from The Princess Diaries. I’m completely OK with that. ♦

To me, 17 sounds older than 18, mostly because odd numbers are typically “edgier” than even ones. (Side note: I really do not want to be 19 next year, because 19 is an absolutely gross number.)
I am 18 now. My childhood is not technically over until I leave for college, which leaves a lot of time left for kid-ish stupidity, but I must admit, a very youthful part of me died on Tuesday night.
I watched my country—which mind you, I never necessarily believed in or ever thought to be above prejudice—make the decision to elect the guy who played Waldo’s dad in The Little Rascals President. Hours before, I had very confidently proclaimed to my friends that I never foresaw a Republican President taking office again in my lifetime, because the party was disjointed, and the liberal public was simply savvier. I was so sure.
As a child, there are these feelings of certainty in everything surrounding you. Your house will always be your house, your cat will never die, your grandpa will never be diagnosed with cancer, Oprah Winfrey will never cease to provide you after-school self-help. In context, these assumptions seem logical, because your understanding of time is incomplete. Knowing this, and having grown up, I thought I had come to terms with random change. I hadn’t.
What I thought I knew was not the truth. That’s a very hard lesson to learn. And, to add another layer to this muddled disaster of uncertainty, despite what I’d been taught before, being a legal adult isn’t making it any easier to learn. ♦

She smelled like perfume and tobacco, this sweet musky aftertaste that was left when we said goodbye. I have a type, and going out with her definitely went against that. I like chubby, posh femme girls who wear puffy dresses and too much lipstick and pronounce my name like I am an endangered species. 
She carried muscle like I store fat and spoke as though she had seen it all. She touched me like life depended on it. And in that moment it did.
We didn’t kiss, even though she tried and I wanted to, because I like girls with long hair, dinner bells, and ball gowns and she hasn’t worn a dress in 10 years. She doesn’t know about spilled milk and maybe I should stop expecting people to have had the same life as me, but I have tea parties and she has never even had lunch.
And yet here I am, thinking about her, again and again. ♦

I’m happy to be nearing the end of my semester. It’s been a trying time, mentally. It’s so crazy, to lose a friend some years back would’ve been this dramatic ordeal. Today, here I am relieved to let go of the empty baggage. If I’m not standing to gain anything in our friendship but I’m giving so much, then why am I keeping you around? I feel, for the first time in my life, that I’m stepping into my own as an adult woman. More and more every day, I’m shaping myself into the person I want to be and surrounding myself with people who want to uplift me. The black women who took me under their wing when I came onto this campus have continued to extend themselves. I’m going to miss them terribly when they’re gone. I understand the importance of having an advocate and forging a community in seemingly impossible circumstances, a sentiment that’ll only increase in Donald Trump’s America. I haven’t begun to speak on that, as I’m still in shock and denial! Until then… ♦

School has been really overwhelming lately, I’ve had so many assignments and tests to study for. Amidst my stress I watched the Karate Kid movies and Mr. Miyagi says that balance is an essential in life, so I figured I should stop panicking and take more breaks during my study sessions. It’s funny, once I started thinking like this, I felt like I was on track with my work and it reassured me. I panicked less and stopped letting my mental health deteriorate. 
Last week, something happened to me in school that made me extremely angry. I was in Religious Education class and in the textbook for Christian beliefs there was a section in the chapter on suffering that mentioned the Charleston massacre. 
I said to my friend who was sitting opposite me, “I really hate these stories, they make me really upset.” 
“But there is nothing you can do about it,” she replied. 
In my head I was thinking, Well, gun laws could be changed, we should recognize and change the way police treat people of colour in comparison to how they treat white people, and we could call the murderer who committed the massacre a terrorist rather than avoiding the label because he’s white. But I didn’t say anything because I felt slightly afraid at the thought of confronting her. Instead, I said, “Isn’t that the guy who was given Burger King?“ She cut me off immediately: “The police had to do that so that he would confess.” I sat in my chair thinking, So, you don’t recognize the difference between the treatment of white people and black people by the police? Don’t you realize that black people are murdered by the police, in front of their families, for simply putting their hands up?
It really upset me that she thought there was nothing we could’ve done to stop that racist murderer from killing multiple black people. There are, in fact, many things to be done. By the time I die, I hope that I make at least one privileged person realize that we can always do something, no matter how minor it may seem, to effect change. ♦

“Oh, look at that. Fascinating,” he says.
“And the offset,” I say, “could that have been caused by the impact that led to the axial tilt? A redistribution of the mass—there are moons like that—”
“I would counter that,” he muses, “by drawing attention to how similar the B-fields are. Since the planets themselves are so alike—”
It’s not a situation I could have imagined myself in two months ago, but here I am in my astronomy professor’s office, meant to be discussing my class schedule for next semester and instead debating the significance of Uranus and Neptune’s particularly weird magnetic fields. When I eventually trade places with the next student he’s advising I hear him say “Come in. Oh, Lilly and I were just talking about—” and it’s a little surreal, to finally have someone I can have those conversations with. It’s a little odd, too, awkward. He’s my professor, not my peer. (I get incredibly self-conscious about how often I say “um.”) But in the end, we’re just two people who care about the same thing and I feel emboldened by his willingness to listen, to address my questions without condescension.

The first snow falls. I call my mother that night. She says, “Will your flight home next week be delayed?”
I hope not. At my roommate’s request I lay siege to the crank that supposedly operates the central heating in our dorm room until something creaks and bubbles and warm air gushes forth. On my numb fingers it feels like a fountain of youth.

Packing to go home is difficult. I brought a subset of my belongings with me when I came here, and now I am bringing a smaller subset back. My bag ends up light: a pair of jeans, a few T-shirts, a flannel, enough socks and underwear to last the week.
I’ve felt lost at times while I’m here, but in the end I do feel like I belong. It just doesn’t feel like home—it feels like summer camp, like I’ve barely been here a week. At the same time, I can’t figure out when meandering solo across campus and trudging up the stairs to my room became so routine, so ordinary that I don’t bat an eye at the thought of living on my own. I still call my parents every Sunday, but somewhere in the mix I think I’ve grown up. I just don’t know what that means yet. ♦

“Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.”
My greatest interest is learning. My favorite place to learn from is YouTube, where I watch videos about weird conspiracy theories. My favorite conspiracy theory concerns the Denver Airport, which a lot of people think was built by the New World Order. I don’t believe in the New World Order, but it’s kind of funny to pretend I do. Except sometimes, the evidence is so strong that I question whether it’s just irony guiding the hours I spend researching triangles.
My greatest talent is figuring out people’s ages. I think about years a lot. I know it’s just simple arithmetic, but I’m always thinking to myself, how old is someone born in 1986 right now? And the answer would be 30, unless they were born in December or late November, in which case they would be 29. But another person, let’s say they were born in 1945, well they would be 71, maybe still 70. It’s so interesting how time works. It’s different for everyone but it all works the same way. 
The most important thing colleges should know about me is that I am not a millennial. I strongly dislike being called a millennial. (I don’t use the word hate because I have a personal conviction that it is a strong word.) Millennial has such a negative connotation—not that there’s anything actually wrong with millennials, I’m just not one. A millennial is someone who didn’t have social media until they were a young adult. I was on Facebook in fifth grade. Therefore my generation needs a different name. I’d suggest iGeneration, in the vein of the generation-defining television show, iCarly. Oh, did I mention that when I grow up I want to write for TV, or other some kind of career involving similar skills and carrying the same social stigma. That’s why I have to go to college, so I can do that.
I hope you liked my essay and now understand that I am a unique student with her own thoughts and ideas. Please accept me. Please. Thank you. ♦

My class schedule for this academic semester is wild, shifting from two classes in the morning and two in the evening. Although at times I don’t quite know the relevance of taking up core courses (those totally unrelated to my major), I still find them fascinating, either because of professors who take to the heart what they’re teaching, or me feeling too young and inexperienced to boldly confine myself to one subject.
There was never any more inception than there is now,
Nor any more youth or age than there is now,
And will never be any more perfection than there is now,
Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.
—Walt Whitman, “Song of Myself”
On Friday, my country, the Philippines, failed to uphold its democracy by allowing the body of Ferdinand Marcos, a former dictator, to be buried in Libingan Ng Mga Bayani (Heroes’ Cemetery), 27 years after his death. (Prior to burial, the former dictator’s body was preserved in an air-conditioned crypt in his hometown in the northwest corner of the island of Luzon; if this isn’t creepy enough for you, then I don’t know what is.) The ceremony was done stealthily on Friday morning, with the public only knowing a few hours after. Many on the left took to social media, enraged, while those on the right asked for forgiveness without ever actually uttering the words. The Supreme Court of the Philippines ruled on the issue by allowing the burial, but due to numerous appeals and protests carried out by the anti-Marcos left, the issue wasn’t really given any closure. Thus was the public’s surprise when news of the burial spread. 
This has become a very sensitive issue in my country, and most people affected by Martial Law are still grieving over the pain and loss, 44 years later. I understand their pain and sympathize with them more than I understand those on the privileged side, those who enjoyed living on the misery of others, the people who felt entitled to forgiveness without sincere acknowledgment of their transgressions. The Marcos apologists demand that the issue be closed and quieted down now, but they should know that forgiveness doesn’t come easy, and nor does forgetting. That’s why even in death and in the grave, he is still considered a thief by the Filipino people.
To do: Retrace the lines of history and know exactly where the fault lines are; take notes and know that this could be repeated; prevent repetition of historical scars; uphold the sanctity of the land and the rights of its people under our democracy, no matter how stained by previous and present leaders. Do the actual important work of remembering, pondering, and fighting. ♦

My time at home is brief. I meet my brother’s boyfriend and visit family I have not seen since the summer. My cousins are all taller than me now, growing up in the literal sense. Sometimes I find myself hiding from them all, retreating to somewhere quiet, my mother my only pursuer. I tell her stories about physics that I’ve picked up from instructors along the way. It’s the only way to get them out of my head, crammed as it is with questions about extrasolar planets and magnetism and cosmology—relentless.
I meet a professor from the local university with coffee. For an hour or two he empties my head of those questions and fills it with new ones, about C++ and real analysis and elusive big data.
I fly back to school alone. I become precise, methodical again: unpack, get dinner, do laundry, do homework. I clean my half of the dorm rapidly, efficiently: scrub the sink, make the bed, stick up the posters that crawl off the wall every three days, put on music to drown out the commotion in the hallway as more people slink back to their rooms for the next three weeks. And it’s only three weeks: two of classes, one of exams. I have recommendation letters to request and essays to draft for research program applications. I have no time to be tired. I know this isn’t beyond me anymore. ♦

It’s cold! 
I’m inside and I still feel as though my hands are gonna fall off. The only time it’s OK to be this cold is when there is snow. The weather says it’s four degrees but I don’t believe it. I reckon we’re now in the minuses. 
Christmas is fast approaching. I have done the majority of my gift shopping, and I’m looking forward to giving them to the people I love. I’ve decided to make my ’net girlfriend and best friend “open when” boxes. These are boxes of letters and small tokens to be opened on certain dates, to coincide with specific events, or when feeling specific emotions. 
The Christmas tunes are being played constantly in the shops, and I can feel the excitement of the shoppers and the disdain of the folks who work there. Soon we’ll be getting cards through the letter box and seeing fairy lights in every window and eating and drinking twice as much, just because of the season. ♦

1. New York is leaking. This feels like something I would grasp from a Metro headline, ABC-7 Chyron, but I see it in the Union Square station and the flooded concrete banks of Lower East. Someone burst our bubble.
Woman is dancing with ties near the moving platform…woman is dead somewhere near my school, somewhere in one of the Heights, somewhere in the hole in my ceiling. I hear thumps in it at night that are louder than the subway. I tell myself to become one so they will not decry my languid body a foreign one to expel. 
On the train, woman in the corner jolts awake and vomits up an orange chunk duvet that just barely misses my right foot. I have not vomited on a train since age one but they purge me on occasion. 
1a. Something I just found out: The two primary definitions for “purge” are opposites within a whole same—
verb: rid (someone) of an unwanted feeling, memory, or condition, typically giving a sense of cathartic release. 
 noun: an abrupt or violent removal.
2. Some warm parallels: Discussing the fifth dimension (original concept accredited to Miranda July) with Tavi—when there exists a rift between a person’s general demeanor and how they exist in their art; heart attack realization during my daily show run that The Twilight Zone refers to the surreal region of that name as the fifth dimension. 
A friend asks me what my favorite number is—I tell him lucky 13 and he shows me the number in Roman numerals inked onto one of his fingers 
I have a dream in which one of my closest friends is walking alongside me with such a stressed expression that it stays with me when I wake up. I message them and they tell me that they had a dream in which the two of us are confronting their deathbed and traveling the circumference of their life’s roulette wheel until it leads us back to denouement. 
3. Mom’s death anniversary: 11/26. Mom’s birthday: 12/12. I always called it lucky. She was a lucky strike and I extinguished her. Never forgive me for it. ♦

Nothing helps grief but crying.
In a dream I saw priests sprinkling holy water on our land; land where our house was built.
The next day I woke up, slowly and then all at once, when I heard my grandmother calling me to attend to my dog Daisy. I stretched and cracked my body, then got up. I noticed that my dog was sleeping in an awkward position that wasn’t how she would normally sleep. I bent down to reach over and rub her belly, when I noticed that she wasn’t breathing. No up and down rhythm, she didn’t look up to acknowledge me. Then, as the truth of the situation dawned on me, I screamed and told my grandmother that Daisy was not breathing. I reached down again to touch her head, then her neck, and concluded that she was already gone.
Gone, not like a wandering kind of gone, but physically gone forever.
It was strange, the progression of Daisy being a creature I knew to be warm, jovial, sweet, and accommodating to the Daisy that is cold, still, lifeless, unbreathing. I am so heartbroken that I can’t place it anywhere, can’t store it for posterity, can’t reserve it for when I’m strong enough to handle grief. 
Last Friday, the day my one true pal died, I lurked in thin air and ceased to exist as a human being with a to-do list to tick off and a schedule to adhere to. I did go to school, for I feared I might die of sadness at home, with the knowledge that Daisy’s body was just outside, ready to go back to earth.
When I got home that afternoon, I buried Daisy knee-deep in the ground just outside my room. When I carried her body toward the grave, I realized it wasn’t the Daisy I knew and loved–like a soul to the body, body to the soul. I will never forget her warmth, but also the coldness that lingered all over her as I said my last goodbye to the decaying, corporeal body.
Thank you and night night, cooch. <3 ♦

I remember high school by boys. 
Freshman year, I liked so many boys. A new boy every month; it was invigorating. I knew nothing would come of my crushes—I was too afraid. It was OK. I was 15, which made everything excusable. I had three more years to develop real feelings and have them reciprocated and live experiences that would later be stories in my novels and screenplays. What I had was enough; the blush of my cheeks after hallway interactions and the cracked deliveries of returned hellos were constant reminders of my youth and vitality, as were the blood pumping to orifices and my heart at the sight of someone special. And there was Harry Styles. I loved him. I read fan fiction every night before bed because my new house was scary and only thoughts of his heat radiating next to mine could lull me sleep. I built a shrine to him in my room. I thought about him more than anyone. 
Sophomore year was spent kissing the same two boys over and over again in a pattern and going crazy thinking about what they might have said to their friends about it or thought of me. To offer perspective, I still had braces at 16 and very low self-esteem. I had a compulsion to be validated by others. I decided Harry Styles wasn’t cute anymore, largely because he was in a boy band on the verge of irrelevance. 
Junior year I entered a civil agreement of emotionless fun with an older boy of good standing, and was maybe attached (I’m only beginning to be truthful with myself about this). I rarely wrote about it because once said boy told me he’d been high and read everything I’d ever written on the internet ever. There was no structured end to things, because it’s 2016 and things don’t work that way anymore. I thought about boys maybe as much as I did freshman year. Sometimes they were specific—obsessive re-evaluation of a conversation; other times broad—wondering where and who I’d be involved with in three days or two months or a year. 
Senior year, I have bigger and more important things to focus on than boys. The school feels smaller and less full of opportunity. For this reason, I avoid boys. I feel independent, and a little bit alone, but I’m my best self in solitude. Except I don’t know really. I feel like shit. (This is unrelated to boys, more to do with my academic aptitude, or lack thereof.)
Harry Styles was on the cover of a magazine because his boy band is now irrelevant and he has to establish himself as an unaccompanied star. My friend sent me the photos, and this great feeling came back, of youth and vitality and complete freedom. A displacement of all my real feelings, romantic and sexual, into a photo of a celebrity that I’ll probably never meet. It erased all sinking sentiment of being unsure or nervous or, worse, invested. It was just me, and the pictures in the magazine, designed to sell me teen idols and Gucci loafers. ♦

October 3 makes four years since my first diary for Rookie. In all of this time, I’ve never ceased being astounded by someone telling me that they read my diaries. When I write, I am talking to myself, and someone past myself whom I cannot see. I never really think about people actually seeing an entry, even though I know it’s being published on a public forum. But even though I know that there are a few people out there consuming all my thoughts, I don’t see a point in ripping myself out of that somewhat solitary mindset. What good could come of it? I can’t address anyone more than I already have—by sharing what I can about my life and myself, and how I deal with it. Thank you for reading. Thank you again if you are someone who has told me that you’ve found solace in my writing, and thank you simply if you have found that solace. It gives me comfort to consider in my worst moments, but also my best. 
This week is a four-day weekend, and halfway through I remember last year’s Rosh Hashanah. It was the only one I was ever able to celebrate, and I try not to let the memories of challah and newness overwhelm me. Boy asks, “What do you know about challah?” Other Boy asks, “What are you doing with your life?” Both make me laugh. 
Tonight I go skating as soon as the dusk starts to settle in, for the first time without the gauntlet on my still somewhat fragmented ankle. I stop every time I pass by the corner where I was hit. I always expect to see or feel something new—don’t ask me why. 
I have a lot of work to do. I can’t believe it’s a new month. One down, eight more to throw. ♦

I’m sure that any conversation that my parents have had regarding me and sex has been brief and gray on account of the fact that, until yesterday, I was scared of tampons. Mostly, because of the misconception I had that the plastic applicator goes in you and doesn’t come out. That, and the notion that you stand during Disneyland’s Tower of Terror, were my two most detrimental ideas, because Tower of Terror was the best kick in the adrenaline, and tampons are the keys to the universe.
I made an audible “oohhhhh” sound after feeling the plastic pop off, following the faded pink manual so generously included in the dust-coated box (do tampons expire? do they need to be refrigerated?). A sound that is generally reserved for one’s first baking soda volcano. In that moment, the world made sense.
The last time I was this proud was completing my laundry at NYU. 
I couldn’t believe how completely and utterly un-traumatic the entire ordeal was, and held a moment of silence for all of the panties whose lives could have been spared if only the California public school system didn’t try to play hard to get with us over our own bodies. 
I told my mom, and in her mom voice, she said, “I’m proud of you! Now don’t go getting any ideas…” ♦

On Wednesday, I felt like Mia Thermopolis from The Princess Diaries. Two minutes after I tripped over in gym class, I got hit in the face with a ball. It was so embarrassing and everyone, including the girl who threw it, was laughing at me. The gym teachers don’t care if you feel uncomfortable in the groups you’re put in, so I’m always stuck with the “popular” people and, due to my lack of coordination, I always fall over or do something to embarrass myself. 
On another note, although I rarely talk about boys, I’ve been sat on the same table in class with a boy who I think is kind of cool. I told him about the ball incident and he made me feel so much better—he made a joke about it and the pain and embarrassment soon turned into laughter. I told him about the weird American skater boys that DM me on Instagram and he started to make a really loud drum beat, to annoy our teacher. He’s one of those people that, although he’s popular, doesn’t think he’s better than anyone else. I like that a lot. 
While in class, I had a strange thought: I feel sorry for TV antennas because they’re always plain and grey, but they do all of the work. They’re constantly taken for granted. I guess we have something in common. I can’t explain these thoughts to people around me because they would probably think it’s weird that I give inanimate objects feelings and emotions. It’s not my fault I like giving silenced things a voice! ♦

The bulk of my homework revolves around watching movies alone, which sounds great in theory, but takes up a lot of my time. Thankfully, my friend came to visit for the weekend. She took me out to a rap show, giving me and my burnt out eyes a much needed break from my computer screen. The show was in this small, trippy DIY space in Manhattan. They had this one gadget that threw paint at a screen that had someone’s chewing mouth on a loop. It was a little different for me because I’ve never been too keen on diving into vapor wave culture, but once people started performing I realized I actually like vapor wave and cloud rap. Well, at least I really like this one artist who performed, Taharqa. I know I’m late to the party, but it had to grow on me, OK? I also realized that I haven’t been in a moshpit in a long time. Jumping up and down, shoving people, and being shoved felt like the ultimate release to after a long year of being tired and burnt out. I feel so much better at my new school, but I still struggle with depression. No matter where I go I’m still trapped in my own head, and that’s what I find most terrifying. 
On top of that, I’m getting really tired of the limited images that are associated with the “carefree black girl” and self-care. Images of lighter-skinned girls with loose curls prancing around with flowers in their hair doesn’t do anything for me when I don’t feel carefree at all. I feel more like this. The mood I’m in right now calls for pictures of black girls breaking things and being aggressive, taking up spaces and shouting at the top of their lungs. 
I’m depressed, and although I’m oh so grateful for everything I have, sometimes I feel completely alone and these aren’t happy times. I have a lot to worry about and no one to talk to, or at least no one who won’t look at me with astonishment or worse, a blank stare because “it’s a lot to take in, and I don’t know what to say.” Lately, when my friends call me for emotional support it makes me even sadder, not that it annoys me like it did this past summer, because they’ve been much better about that. I’m jealous that they feel so comfortable talking to me about their most intimate problems and secrets. I wish I was comfortable enough with someone to want to confide in them like that. I can’t. My worries are like worms wriggling through dirt. I can’t even properly listen my favorite new albums, because the content is sad and I don’t want it to make me slip even deep in my depression abyss. It’s scary, not knowing what to do with your feelings. 
I am one of those people who keeps all of their real problems locked away in a jar. I feel the top is beginning to give, my gooey emotions are bubbling past the lid, and I’m so on edge that anything, in any place can make me cry at moment. Except I don’t even think I know how to cry anymore. The only thing that quiets all this black noise in my head is a good book and some tea. The fact that I’m reading consistently again is evidence that my depression is nowhere near as bad as it was last year school year. Maybe the pools of black under my eyes will disappear some day.
It’s funny how I’ve been getting hit up a lot less by certain “friends” ever since I told them to stop constantly getting in touch to complain about their problems, and expecting me to take them on, without even genuinely asking me about my own mental health. It proves that my only value to them was being their emotional labor mammy. They find nothing redeemable in me besides the fact that I’m a good listener. I’m just that “strong, mature, and deep” friend, aka the friend we can use as an emotional punching bag and not ask if she’s OK after ’cause she’s “strong, mature, and deep.” I’m happy about this. I’m happy that these people have lost interest in me, ’cause they were literally draining me all summer. 
Up until recently, I was haunted by some of the things my ex-friends said about me that others don’t agree with at all. A visit from a friend put everything into perspective. She kept telling me about how caring and genuine I was, and that I have nothing to worry about when it comes to being a good person. Why do all the negative things people say about me ring louder in my brain than the plethora of sweet, kind comments my true friends give me? ♦

All the people I am not:
I am not the person who finished and submitted all of their college applications weeks ago and now only has to focus on the mundane busywork offered by the first semester of senior year. It is OK that I am not this person, because maybe they will think of or do something truly amazing just before their application is due, and they will not be able to add these elements to the selling of themselves. I will, because there is a likely chance I will be submitting my application the night before it is due. 
I am not the person who has 8,500 followers on Instagram because of their very nice skin and hair, and distinctive facial beauty. It is OK that I am not this person, because it would maybe feel impersonal to be recognized for something as arbitrary as my outward appearance. Also, having an underwhelming adolescence builds character and makes you relatable in conversation at adult parties later on. 
I am not the person who is always clothed in dreams. (Instead, I am riding a bike taxi across town with three passengers and no bra or shirt. I am hiding in a closet at a party, my underwear somewhere on the ground in the room set before me. I have shown up to school naked.) It is OK that I am not this person, because I think sweating in your sleep is very detoxifying, and there is nothing that results in keener alertness than being violently awoken from a nightmare. 
These are not all the people I am not, but writing eight billion paragraphs would be very tiring. ♦

It’s like I thought these books would disintegrate into knowledge that I could absorb through my fingertips; a highly contagious force that only I could interact with because I had bought the book. (Well, my dad had bought it.) 
I had a sad dream—a rarity in that it wasn’t an extreme on the spectrum of joyous and horrific—that my 18th birthday was sucking it up, but I found a gift shop. Inside, on the biggest shelf, every book from my Amazon shopping cart was confidently awaiting me. It’s like I thought these books would be my friends. 
Under siege of viewbooks from Pratt Institute and Columbia University, we are. I need their magic now, need it fast. It’s a shame to be stuck in such a precarious situation with titles such as The Oil Painter’s Bible and an alcohol-stained copy of July’s Poetry magazine (my former roommate’s doing). For now, I’ll leave them be. ♦

When Hurricane Matthew was in full swing, social media made it possible for me to witness its effects in realtime. A tap on my screen showed me flooded rivers, extreme rain, and positivity despite the destruction. I imagine that the people in Matthew’s path prepare for things like this the same way everyone in California prepares for earthquakes: often and thoroughly. 
The puns and jokes made by the people in the middle of this storm surprised me in the best way. 
“Got my house remodeled by Matthew, it turned out nice.” Someone on Snapchat laughed as they showed that a tree had fallen on their roof.
This is why I get frustrated when older people are so persistent with trying to convince everyone that cellphones are evil. Social media and the internet have given me opportunities that I never could have imagined. I have friends across the world and I have answers to my questions within seconds. I’ve been able to support people who need help within seconds. I can get a sense of what’s happening in the world around me. I’m not limited by proximity, and I’m grateful for that. ♦

I feel bad for being unbearable and all the times the people I love haven’t been able to deal with me and for all the good energy I’ve scared away. I feel bad for growing older but not being any more organized or adept at things that require common sense or getting better at handling my relationships. 
College is my only shot at freedom from the stupid burdens I have and I’m even messing that up. (Probably not, but I only know my subjectivity, and I think that’s one of my mistakes.) I think it is safe to say that I genuinely hate myself and I can’t stop letting people know that to make up for all my perceived errors. I have nothing else to say. I’m going to stop myself from disappointing myself even more by not giving myself the chance to. ♦

I never thought I’d say this, but I am offended by my living space. Not offended in that I’m not on good terms with the people I am living with (who need to be given special care sometimes), but offended as in I am constricted by it. There are days when I choose to take the long walk home because I don’t want to even touch the door handle of our house. One half of our house is made of concrete, the other half a combination of different kinds of lumber and wood. I have been living here for five years now; in those five years I’ve tried creating a home by way of ornamental plants, lovely music on speakers, taking in pets and friends. Sometimes it’s like that, and sometimes it takes and straps me in, leaving me unable to breathe and wade through school work, personal emotional mazes, friend drama, et cetera.
My grandmother and I took to cleaning our house this weekend: I scrubbed the floor raw of dirt and my departed dog’s ticks, but not enough to make me feel fully unencumbered by its virtual stench and stink—something I always imagined houses, or even homes, to be made of. I liberally doused kerosene on a tick-infested portion of a wall, anxious over what would become of the little crawly ones, and thankful that they just fell right through. When I was done, I was reminded of Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s One Hundred Years of Solitude; of how the parasites and infestations that manifest in that house are a byproduct of not being wakeful enough in one’s space, not generating enough care, a latent abandonment of some sort. I wanted to rub the whole house raw and clean, flip it from the inside out, but then I remembered the house is not a paper house, not a play thing, alive with creepy crawlies in the corners.
I pause and ask myself what I want: Something close to clinical, where the walls are white and where I can sustain my own life—my flowers’, my pets’, my friends’. I have always dreamed of cooking—preparing something, a snack maybe—for my friends whenever they want to come over and rest, which I think is the only one thing I’m absolutely willing to give in my relationships, to make up for my lack of friendship touchy-feely-ness and corniness.
I wonder aloud, online if I ever will cultivate a home like this, an imagined ideal, like Jack and Rose’s “To the stars!” monologue in Titanic, where the cupboards are clean and there is always something going on—music playing, a page of a book being turned, water boiling, or the smell of orange peel permeating the air. ♦

Conspiracy theories have taken over my possibly computer-simulated life. I’m falling down the rabbit hole at a mind-boggling speed. The idea that my world may not be what I’ve always thought has put me at peace and shaken me at the same time. 
My entire life, I’ve been a little worried that I’d never gain the ability to see the world beyond the black and white that I’ve been taught. Sure there’d be gray spots, but I’d heard of them and been taught to not bring them up. My mother used to tell me ghost stories when I was younger, everyone else in my family disregarded anything out of the ordinary. 
I think that’s why I was, for lack of better a better term, SHOOK when I started seeing conspiracies trending on social media. It was as though one day I was just living my life, and the next Curious George doesn’t have a tail, there’s no “-” in KitKat, and the Mandala Effect is a big part of my life.
My overwhelming need to tell everyone every interesting thing I learn brought me to learn that my math teacher minored in Philosophy. Why hadn’t I thought of that before? That’d be the perfect thing for me to study! Upon finding out that this was an actual thing that I could do with my life I turned to the person next to me and said, “Does this mean I can get paid for overthinking things?”
Turns out it’s a lot more than that, but I think it’ll be funny to able to answer the question about how I picked my major with: “Well Twitter had a HUGE role in my decision.” ♦

I find myself miraculously suspended in a mess of past, present, and future, unable to relate to anything but the biting rope of time snaked around my ankle. The only pockets of sleep that I am able to crawl into are lined with selections from my vault of repression and fantastical accounts of my everyday tragedies. I become a spectacle no matter where I turn. 
I think of red, enveloping myself in it and becoming a fetish for Aphrodite or some envious younger sister who churns her rage into sex like butter. I think of the Virgin Mary, whose calling-card I found on the day of her messenger’s supposed visit. The subway’s rank steps have always offered me more than any chapel, and taken less, too. 
I think of the boy I knew at church when I was 10 and he was 15 who had a crush on me. We were both altar children and I couldn’t understand his infatuation. Our game was being mad at each other—he would call me a name, I would call him two. I would tease him beneath the communion wine cabinet and he would follow me down the hall to wrestle me, his hands swimming to the bank beneath my chest and lingering there until he heard footsteps. One day, when we were lying in a crumple of white altar robes, he told me to kiss him. I remember it being one of the first times my thought loop had come to a full halt, the only substance in my head being the dual image of his overly polished snakeskin Sunday shoes and the fair cotton in front of me. I’d had an obsession with first kisses that saved me from being eaten by him, one that dictated that I would only allow it to happen when I was really attracted to a person that I wouldn’t mind remembering forever. I don’t remember how I made him leave but I did. I quit being an altar girl and sat in the back row until I stopped going to church. “Boys will be boys,” the priest told me. 
“You should have screamed and ran,” my mother said as she washed my hair after bringing me home. “Isn’t that what I taught you? When a stranger tries to do something to you that’s what you do.”
He hadn’t been a stranger. It wasn’t like she’d told me the attempts to steal me away would be like. The fear factor had always lain in the image of an unknown lurking behind me in his car, or approaching me to ask for my assistance in looking for his lost dog.
I think about the man who spent hours and hours telling me all the different ways in which he would hurt me, and then even more time telling me that I wanted it, all while his wife slept beside him. I think about him telling me how much he wanted to watch me skate and how he would never get bored and how much he wanted to visit me and how transparent it all was, but how little I saw because I was infinitely smaller than I fully realized, the way we always are before our next progression in life. I think about how many poems I write with his image melded onto those of all the other, lesser abusers in my life, a Frankenstein of unwantedness for my own private crucifixion. Strangers I welcomed into my own home with a too-warm grin, and ones who broke in through the basement window. Another spectacle.
I consider all the other ones I can’t name: the two men who found me when I blacked out in France, the tens upon tens of men who have stopped me in the street to ask me if I can really ride my skateboard, the hundreds if not thousands of men who have yelled at me for my number or to fuck or even to marry me, the same hundreds of those who have gone into great detail in the middle of the street about how they would fulfill my uncommunicated desires, the ones who lurk on the social media of my friends and I because, with the end of the era of chat rooms, they can forgo the coercion and settle into intense sexualization under the guise of blind admiration, the boy in ninth grade who got so mad when he found out that I had a girlfriend that he called me a dyke every day for a week and told me that he hadn’t known that I liked to eat out, the teacher who made eye contact with my chest for a day and would only talk to me out of all the seniors in my class and stuttered when I asked him questions, a much needed et cetera. I am afraid of how long this list grew before my eyes as I wrote, and even more afraid of the fact that there are more offenses to be named, and absolutely paralyzed by the thought that this will only double itself annually for the remainder of my days. No matter how resilient and combative I become it persists. Boys will be boys. ♦

WHAT IS FEMININITY? 
A few months ago my sister’s friend was grilling me about my sexuality, she wanted to know if I was really apart of the LGBTQ community and if so, what label in the spectrum of queerness could she could place on me. She made being queer seem like some exclusive club that I could only be accepted into if I passed her little initiation test. She looked at me as though I had just shoved a worm in my mouth when I said I’d never been romantically involved with someone. 
“So you have sex, but you’ve never really liked anyone? How can you know you’re queer if you’ve never pursued a relationship with a woman?!” she snarled. 
 I’m sorry. I’m pretty sure kids who are around eight years old and show signs of attraction to someone have never been in a romantic relationships, but that doesn’t make their sexuality any less valid. She didn’t get it. 
At the end of her spitfire questionnaire she gave me her diagnosis: “You’re a stem. You know what that means? A mix between stud and femme, because although you dress feminine, you’re personality is aggressive.” 
This bothered me. First of all, I don’t understand the need for labels like “stem” in an already label-heavy community. Also, why is me being an assertive forward woman make me more masculine? Why is aggressiveness only associated with men or studs? There’s evidence that throughout history women have been warriors and cold killers, so being strong-headed is not something new to us. My brazen aura shouldn’t be looked at with such shock.
Writing this, I don’t even know what femininity is. The google definition says feminine means “having qualities or appearance traditionally associated with women, especially delicacy and prettiness.” OK, well being pretty is subjective, and isn’t everyone delicate to some degree? There are certain actions and things that can break any of us. As a kid, I thought being a girl automatically made me feminine, but I guess I was wrong because my reluctance to wear dresses and affinity for climbing trees had family members begging me to to do more “girly things.” Then, as I started high school, it was “why don’t you ever wear dresses? You should try wearing makeup.” and I didn’t and still don’t understand why those things are so essential to performing womanhood. Identifying as a girl should be enough to deem someone feminine. 
These past few years I’ve incorporated more dresses into my wardrobe, not because of pressure from family but because I enjoy wearing them now. Finally, I thought, this will be enough to get everyone to stop bothering me about looking like more typical girl. But nope, now it’s: “You know, you’re very forward. You walk like this. Haha, you’re such a boy when it comes to relationships.” If I do anything outside of what people see as traditionally feminine I’m suddenly not a woman anymore. I constantly feel like I’m walking on a tightrope in front of a huge crowd. and if I sway a little to the left, without even being aware of it, the crowd begins to shout and boo at me, telling me to get back in line. 
In my opinion, much like masculinity, there’s little multiplicity in being feminine. There’s no room for complexity, and that makes me feel trapped, which sucks because I should feel liberated. Being a girl is awesome. I have no qualms with my gender identity, I’m fine with the gender I was assigned at birth, but I don’t like all the pressure that comes with it. My sister’s friend labeled me “aggressive” in the middle of summer, but toward the end of the season I was hanging with my friend Ally after a night of fun when Ally said, “Ahh Thahabu I love you, you’re so aggressive.” Ally called me aggressive as a compliment, while my sister’s annoying friend said it was something to be wary of. It’s quite clear I’m not the only person who’s bored with femininity.
This topic crosses my mind more and more as I grow older and “become a woman.” I’m still trying to figure out where I fit in these finite notions of femininity, as a girl who was raised solely by her dad and was what some would call a “tomboy.” I’m not saying we need to abandon femininity, but it should to be expanded into something broader. There shouldn’t only be one way to be feminine.

This past weekend, I was pulling into the parking lot of my local Quick Chek when I noticed of an older white woman verbally berating a group of three teenagers—all whom I go to school with. This isn’t uncommon, even for a suburb proclaiming its safety. But the boys were all black. And, as observation or experience has taught all of us, being young and black in public is dangerous. I walked over to investigate the situation, to find the woman, clearly intoxicated, stumbling, and screaming vulgarities. 
A car pulled up full of girls from my school who’d just come back from celebrating one of their 18th birthdays. They, too, had noticed her blatant racism and violent demeanor. They told her to calm down and leave the kids alone. She responded by calling one of them a whore, and threatening to punch the girl standing beside her. Someone had started dialing the police when we noticed a sheriff car patrolling the parking lot. 
I ran over with three others and told the police what was going on; that they needed to intervene before someone was hurt. They told us to go home or they’d call our parents and tell them where we were. (It was 9:30 PM and we were at a convenience store. Apparently parents and the law are not OK with that.)
I walked back to the woman. By now, three more people had showed up, one white, and two black. She wailed a few illegible statements and mocked us screaming, “Shut the fuck up, motherfucker,” in some kind of gross attempt at a “black” accent. A brief break from racism was offered when I asked how she planned to get home, and told her I’d do everything in my control to keep her out of a car. She came close to me, and yelled “You’re ugly!”, spraying my face with spit. 
Her abuse continued, worsened by the prevalence of socially aware girls very willing to call her out for it. At a certain point I gave up, just staring at her. She took notice and approached me again, this time standing even closer, and far more intrusive. 
Maybe it was adrenaline, maybe I just really wanted to tear her down, but I said to her, “I pity you. You look like you have a nice life. What makes you do this? Why are you bullying teenagers? You’re pathetic.” I turned away and she grabbed my shirt, then punched me in the back. 
Like the snitch I am, I ran away without hitting her back, laughing nervously, and told the police she’d assaulted me. My desire to get this woman home without any legal action had completely dissipated. 
They responded, “Get in your car. Go home.” They sat in their militarized SUV for the entirety of the interaction, showing no concern or sympathy—offering no support. 
The group of spectators had expanded during my frustrating interaction with the cops. By now, one of the girls she’d called a whore was holding back a white kid from fighting her after she’d called his black friend the N-word during a rant of support for Donald Trump. 
Finally, she was subdued by a stranger offering her a ride. She stumbled into the back seat of car, and I’d realized he’d probably convinced the police not to act. The stranger, who I’ve yet to decide was a good samaritan or not, drove her home. He was black. 
The boy she almost fought followed her car with his friends, and my friends and I followed him. Eventually, all three cars stopped on a narrow residential street. The woman noticed us, and approached the boy’s car. There, she made her boldest proclamation of the night: That she wanted to kill all black people. 
Her helpless guardian told us not to listen to her, and that we should home because if the police became involved, they’d vilify us. I wish he hadn’t been right about that. 
Now, it seems a lot less funny and way more serious than it did when I slo-mo’d the video of her hitting me and recounted the story to my friend over FaceTime. I keep thinking about this woman: how normal and put together she looked, what it felt like when she hit me, how the cops would’ve reacted if she were black and the kids were white, how in the context of the situation, the extremity of her addiction could only be handled with an arrest, how quick she was to use the N-word, the hate and anger in her voice as she addressed three 16-years-olds drinking slurpees, how close she lived to my high school—a block away. ♦

I’m planning to get a haircut in the next few weeks, because I love how healthy my hair feels after a cut. I’m generally really open to change and re-inventing myself, one reason being that I’m afraid that, in 10 years time, I’ll look back at old pictures of myself and realize that I look the same (like how Spongebob wears the same outfit every day and has multiple copies of it in his wardrobe). 
I keep thinking about how I’ve got one week left until my two-week October break. I’m really proud of myself for not missing a of school, despite wanting to stay home and watch Kill Bill—both volumes. I ended up watching them after school instead, because I’m starting to understand that being able to go to school—no matter how ugly the uniform, or how annoying the people are—is a privilege. The first person who comes to my mind when I feel like I’m rejecting my education is Malala Yousafzai. She went as far as risking her life for an education, while I can easily go to school each day. She’s the reason I no longer like missing days from school. 
I thought I should add that after re-watching both volumes of Kill Bill, I remembered how much I love them. Lucy Liu is especially cool to me: She’s such a powerful woman of colour. That’s so cool to me. I really like Gogo Yubari, too; her character is innocent, but she has great fighting skills. She’s a grade A badass. I think Quentin Tarantino’s films are so cool—the music and the shots he uses are perfectly complimentary. Watching his films makes me feel content.
I love that I have my own personal interests, although most people around me don’t know what I like. It makes watching these films and listening to their soundtracks so much better. ♦

I only feel the need to classify one of my seven classes as unbearable. 
The only time of the day when I drag my feet and delay walking to my desk is when it’s time for Economics. I realized the first week of class that my teacher and I just don’t mesh. I’m not saying he’s not a good teacher, because I know that a lot of people in my class really enjoy him. I think the real problem is that he doesn’t seem to want to remember me. 
It’s a few months into the school year and he has yet to learn my name. I’ve had long conversations with him about how he isn’t entering my grades, then, when I remind him the following day, he can’t remember the conversation even happening! I’m getting more and more frustrated with the situation, because this is one of the classes I need to graduate.
I’m trying to stay positive; my other classes are going really well. But even when everything is going 100 percent fine, I still feel a little worried about my academics. I think I’d learn a lot better if I didn’t feel so pressured to memorize everything. 
When I go back to school, I’m going to talk to my counselor about my Econ teacher. I hope she doesn’t think I’m complaining just because I’m getting a bad grade. Graduation, please come faster. ♦

Today, in a subconscious effort to avoid legitimate responsibility, I organized the linen closet.
First, I folded the hand towels (once in half horizontally, then vertically, then horizontally), and placed them in the top drawer of the bureau in order of color. Then, I did the same with the washcloths (folded once in half, horizontally.)
After taking care of the the bath towels, beach towels, tablecloths, and cloth napkins, I moved on to the bins of supplies tucked away in the closet’s built in drawers. 
One bin was dedicated to medical supplies. I threw out all expired medications, and consolidated the Band-Aids into one box. I got rid of the excessive number of cough syrup cups, because my brother and I are basically independently operating adults now. (Note: I kept two for the Robitussin.)
In another bin, I had the genius idea of combining loofahs, foot scrubs, and anti-itch and muscle creams. The theme of this bin: the epidermis. Although in an ideal situation, sunscreen would be included in this bin, there proved too much to fit. Thus, I allocated an entirely different bin to the preventative sprays and lotions. 
The nail polishes were placed upright in their bin; I deemed it too tedious to color code them. Their bin is shaped like an oval and prone to being sloshed around. Order could not be maintained. 
I folded all the shower caps in the hair bin, which reminded me of all the fitted sheets in the linen closet. Attacking the issue of bedding overwhelmed me, so I went to my bedroom and watched Final Destination 3, which is a terrible movie, but includes a line containing reference to Newton’s Third Law: “All actions have an equal and opposite reaction.” Physics. 
Today, I organized the linen closet. As result, I did no homework, and will wake up tomorrow at 4:30 AM to work on some physics problems. ♦

The future does not just speak, it shouts. The future has me combing through the requirements for the different mathematics major tracks at my college, biting my nails over whether applied math versus pure math might fit easier into my four-year plan. The future sets me loose on our study abroad website and says, learn French, learn Swedish, learn German, get started now, there’s no time to lose. We’re on fall break for almost a week and still the future shouts loud enough to drown everything else out: “You aren’t doing enough! What can you be doing to improve yourself? Get ahead in linear algebra. Get ahead in physics. Learn Python. Learn R. Make someone proud, for god’s sake…”
The future tells me to put aside my distaste for hypercompetitiveness. This is an opinion I have long since held, at least when that competitiveness exists to the point that it completely replaces collaboration. There is a part of me that has succumbed to it, that feels an urge to stand out in my chosen field even at the expense of my peers. One one hand, I am not so fond of this part of myself. On the other hand, it would be dangerous to quash it completely. Science is competitive by nature. Classes are competitive; research positions are competitive; job searches are competitive. The fact that it is still prohibitively difficult to raise my hand in class, to make eye contact with my professors on campus, to be proven wrong even by someone who knows better—these are not good signs. I have never considered myself a particularly prideful person, yet I find it near impossible to risk my dignity in the face of doubt. And that is practically the opposite of science! Uncountable pioneers of the scientific method are writhing in their graves as I write this!
The future tells me to overcome this, but it doesn’t tell me how. I feel as if all of my role models have been cemented in history as infallible. So how will I ever be able to understand how they figured it out, how they learned it was OK to be wrong?
The future says, “Learn to love it.”
I’m not sure what that means. ♦

The body question: the body’s imposition—the body’s inquisition 
Creative non-fiction class: prompt: “Write a third person profile about yourself.” 
“Britney Sharliese Franco (July 8, 1999, open-ended) is currently writing a shudder of a half-poem about a man who terrorized her with intimacy for five years. The secretion, curdled milk straight from her left tit spilled across the page, is nudging her into the classic trichotillomania waltz. St. Vitus style, even with her hands cradling the pencil and college-ruled lines. (She, too, feels like a college-ruled line, although she is unsure of the nature of the curvature.)”

I am wearing a bone from the skull of a goat that a girl I loved one summer gave me.
It hangs from my right earring.
I feel decay itch at my neck in the tradition of a passing intruder’s voice.
Anne Carson, “The Gender of Sound,” for the Nemesisters independent study I am doing with my best friend at school: “…this woman’s prophetic body…By projections and leakages of all kinds—somatic, vocal, emotional, sexual—females expose or expend what should be kept in…” 
I am grateful that they have only attempted to strip me of my platelets, below-the-skin defense line, and have found themselves unable to snatch my “private data” (Carson again), unworthy of the reach. Later in the self-profile, I say: “Regardless of her views on men, “the man problem,” et cetera, their presence in her writing is literal, but first and foremost a representation of the trauma they have lazily sewn up her days with.” I want to befriend this girl and flip through our scrapbook of sheared offenses, anguish family lost to laughter in the absurdity of unknown men. Even the ones we can name are enigmas, only because they are so easy to pick apart and be matched with their predecessors. Remembrance of that card game I used to hate as a kid because every playing card had its identical somewhere; I loved the ones with lost twins…killed off identicals…but every man I meet who thinks I am his lost twin is a copy.

Is it weird that my life is full of fantasies and imaginary scenarios? I’m always imagining scenarios in which I meet my favourite musicians and skaters. At first, I did this only when I couldn’t fall asleep at night, to help me ease into the world of dreams. But it’s starting to take over my life. I can be listening to a song alone in my bedroom, but in my head, I’m surrounded by loads of people who have the same interests as me. I doubt it’s a lack of friends causing me to daydream—I have gained acquaintances at school, whom I am fond of—but maybe it’s do do with living kind of far away from school, and not having anyone to hang out with outside of school. I could take a bus, but I hate going on public transport by myself, and when I stay home I feel dazed and confused (I tried so hard not to make any puns!). 
I don’t think daydreaming about being interviewed by Jimmy Fallon is that cool. I’m such a loser. 
Also, a side note: What is love? I feel like a 40-year-old romance novelist made it up. I’m probably too young to understand, like most of the other wonders of life (driving and watching R-rated movies at the cinema—I hate that young people are rarely taken seriously. It’s as though adults think we’re unable to have valid ideas without their help). I adore the story of Romeo and Juliet, but I don’t know if that kind of (unhealthy) infatuation with someone is even possible. I can’t stick to eating the same type of cereal for two months in a row, so I don’t know if I would be willing to die for my theoretical lover. I guess love must be complicated. I think I’m afraid to fall in love because I’ll probably fall in too deep (sorry for the Sum 41 pun, but I’m on a roll) and in return, love someone who feels claustrophobic and slightly uncomfortable. 
I should focus on other things until I can comprehend my opinion on love. Until then, I guess I’ll be sitting in a cafe, in fair Verona, with a small copy of Shakespeare’s sonnets in one hand and a caramel frappuccino in the other. I like the sound of it already. ♦

I am a college student now! Lo and behold, with nearly a week under my belt, here are my reflections:
I brought exactly five books with me to college: Contact by Carl Sagan, Ender’s Game by Orson Scott Card, Nine Stories by J. D. Salinger, First Test by Tamora Pierce, and Dune by Frank Herbert. With the exception of the last (which I have yet to read) these books all have something in common: They have taught me how to think, or how I would like to think; how to approach situations; how to come at things from new angles; how to block out internal stimuli that prevent me from functioning my best and carry on. I think that’s important to hold onto, especially when you’re in a new place. The downside is that many of these books have taught me, especially, how to block out my own feelings, which leads me to my second point.
I still have a lot of emotions surrounding religion/faith/spirituality. The two or three times one of the school’s chaplains has taken the stage during a lecture session—be it to welcome us to the school, talk about multiculturalism, or simply to bring our attention to the school’s Center for Religious and Spiritual Life—I have found myself grinding my teeth to hide the tears. I don’t know why! Something about the topic just leaves me more vulnerable than I’d like to be. Last week, I talked a little about the intersection of faith and science and how I am still struggling to find a balance that I can work with, and I don’t know if that struggle will stop anytime soon. My family is not religious—I know I grew up identifying with the term “agnostic”—but in the past few years especially I have found faith appealing. Not necessarily a strict pursuit of a certain religion (although, of course, to each their own) but to have something definite to believe in. Right now, enough is indefinite in my life that last week’s “oh, well, I believe in something!” no longer holds when I need it to. I thought I could let it go without taking action. Now I see that if I want the guidance I thought that notion would offer me, I need to seek out the answers myself. And I can’t let their existence be in question anymore. If anything, I have to believe that those answers are out there somewhere.
I did not cry when my parents left. I almost did—four, five times. But I didn’t. I met my roommate and we went to see a comedian who was performing on campus and I came back to our room and I slept.
I think I am making friends—slowly, excruciatingly, but I am forcing myself out of my comfort zone, I am talking to people, I am making myself vulnerable to them. We’ve all been going to modules about “what matters” at our campus: alcohol safety, sexual violence awareness, diversity of all kinds. Today we also split into groups of six or seven within our orientation groups to discuss what we had just learned and half an hour later two people, including me, had come out to the entire group. I’ve been “out” in some fashion for years and it was still scary! These things are scary! The school I’m going to is heavily liberal and we’re all encouraged to introduce ourselves with our preferred names and pronouns and if anything, I should feel even safer here than I did at my high school—and I was still afraid. But I did it. I talked to the other kid afterward and now we’re planning to go to an LGBTQ event together on the last day of orientation—so sometimes being vulnerable leads to good things. But that does not stop the fear.
I do have my reasons to be happy. I met with my advisor this week, who also teaches one of my classes, and he helped me make all of the changes to my schedule that I had been crossing my fingers for since I received my first tentative outline. In the spring, I sat in on an astronomy class that basically sealed the deal on my attending this school, and now, this fall, I’ll be able to take that same course—from the same professor, no less. Will I be overworked? With three science courses, two with labs, and an accelerated language course—yes, that’s another lab—it’s safe to say that I’m probably in over my head. But here’s another thing I have to believe: I have to believe it will be worth it. ♦

Sometimes, I feel like everything I write about is trite and stupid and complain-y and redundant because it’s been said a million times before and probably better. And half the time, I’m right. But right now I want to discuss something often ignored. It involves my butt and stuff coming out of it. 
Yes, poop. Everybody poops. It just so happens my bowels are particularly responsive to my personal circumstance.
To offer perspective, my first Halloween memory involves my mother delivering me an enema. I hadn’t pooped in three days, and was told I could not trick-or-treat until I passed a substantial bowel movement. And for some reason, despite the fiber shoved down my mouth, and cushiony toilet seat made available for my usage, I couldn’t complete the task. (Until the enema, of course.) I’m not sure if I was suffering from some kind of health problem. 
On the other hand, when I was 11, during my first summer of sleep away camp, I stopped pooping entirely—for about six days. Maybe it was the toxicity bred by a hormonal environment in which mirror time and outlet access were a battle, or maybe I was just feeling unfamiliar in a new place. I know that.
Today, regularity is no longer a problem, but access is. I cannot poop anywhere but my house. I cannot poop anywhere that doesn’t have baby wipes available for post-fecal cleansing. Pooping, for me, requires routine and consistency. There must be familiarity involved. Yes, vacations are lovely, but they slowly descend into prolonged periods of holding in poop. I do enjoy seeing my family, but I just can’t function correctly in their presence, upon their potties. Toilet security requires conditioning and experience. I worry this will hinder my experiences in life. 
In the same way that Soylent could hypothetically reverse my fears that my careless diet will lead to my demise, I hope one day pooping becomes as routine, unemotional, objective as liquid food. ♦

On Friday night, there was a terrorist attack in Davao, the city where I live. The bombing took place at a night market adjacent to my university. A lot of lives were lost, mostly masseuses who were just trying to make a living that night.
I’m sitting here trying to make sense of what just happened, if ever I can make sense of it. A lot of speculation is being thrown all over news channels as to what larger motive was behind the attack, but I know that whoever planned it and whatever the reason was, it is not justifiable by saying it was a means to an end. Taking an innocent life is not a logical means to an end that could be achieved through discourse.
The strain and paranoia caused by the attack is felt in the veins of my city. Usually, on Saturdays, everyone fills up the city streets, but on the day following the Friday night incident, the streets were devoid of people and vehicles. Everyone is inside their houses watching the news and probably trying to make sense of what happened and mourning the loss and injury of the 81 victims.
I can’t imagine how people in war-stricken countries live like this every day, to fear for your every move in a place you once considered safe and dearly called home. Now my city, the comfort basket that cradles me and tucks me in whenever I’m lonely, will never be the same again. No matter the repairs, or how many military and police troops are on guard, or how many prayers are sent, it will never be the same again. ♦

Seven tips for writing:
1. Don’t plagiarize.
Earlier today, when I was stuck for writing inspiration and worrying about handing in a piece for Rookie, my best friend asked me if i wanted to just use some of her work. Our conversation went as follows:
Her: If you want to use anything I write, you’re more than welcome. I really don’t mind.
Me: Becca, noooo. That’s very sweet but also wrong. I may not have many morals, but when it comes to writing…
Her: …
Me: I have at least seven.
Her: Specifically seven?!
Me: Well…I just made that up, but sure, let me think.
And here we have the first rule, don’t plagiarize, even your best friend’s work, especially your best friend’s work.
2. Don’t apologize for writing.
This is something we do all the time, especially young femmes, girls, and women. We apologize for our words because that’s how we’ve been conditioned. “It’s not very good,” “It’s a bit too long,” “I’ve done better,” are all ways to excuse ourselves from what we’ve written. We don’t need to do that, we apologize enough in our lives, don’t be sorry for writing.
3. All hard work is good work, but not all good work is hard work.
This one might need a bit of explaining. What it means is if you work hard, that’s enough. I don’t care who says it isn’t, if you’re trying your best then your work is good enough. Saying that, sometimes inspiration just appears and writing becomes effortless, easy; this doesn’t mean your work is not good enough, it just means you had a good day.
4. To be inspired is amazing, to inspire is bloody brilliant.
This “rule” is one Becca gave me after I told her that she inspired me. I can’t disagree. It’s an amazing feeling to be inspired, to be able to understand things and create or have new ideas. Knowing that you inspire others is on another level, because that feeling is something you’re giving to others—to people like you.
5. It has probably been written before, but it’s never been written by you.
This doesn’t sound that motivational, but it’s really hard to find new ground. You, however, are unique, and by extension, so is your art. You may not be the only teenager writing about a zombie apocalypse, but nobody is writing about your zombie apocalypse. Don’t be scared that your idea has been written about already; if it’s from you it’s a totally different piece.
6. Just write SOMETHING.
It doesn’t matter what, just anything. It might be utter garbage, it might also be your next masterpiece. That’s the best thing to do when you have a block, write anyway. Eventually you’ll reach a eureka moment, things will click into place.
7. Someone cares.
This one is important: You could be writing for an audience of thousands, for your best friend or just for yourself. It doesn’t matter, because the point is someone cares. You might not even know it, they might not even know it. But someone out there appreciates what you do. And there’s always a possibility that more people will, too. ♦

I’m settling back into school, I can’t believe that I’m entering my sophomore year. I moved in on the Sunday before last, which was stressful in and of itself. My roommate seems cool, although she never seems to leave the room. I’m not sure I could ever see my dorm room as my home, so it’s always surprising to me when people take up residence in temporary spaces as if they plan to live there forever. I never want to bring in too much stuff, because I know eventually, the process of moving it all out will be super time-consuming. I have a method: I have around five bins, containing my clothes, books, and other belongings. When it’s time to leave, I’ll just put everything back in the bins, which makes for easy transportation. 
I don’t really enjoy any of my classes, but they’re better than the ones from last year. For once, I feel challenged, especially in my design class. My professor and I share many of the same interests. She’s from Zimbabwe. Last semester, everyone was telling me how mean she is. I went in kinda nervous, but soon realized she isn’t mean, she just commands a lot of respect. Often, students use free reign to discuss design concepts as an invitation to teach the class. She’s an ASAP Rocky stan, which is refreshing, I’m happy to know “Live. Love. ASAP” affected someone as deeply as it did me. 
I’m dealing with a flurry of emotions. Relief that I made it out the other side of a very tough summer. It was very, very tough dealing with being back home, not getting along with my father, losing my grandfather, personal failures such as inability to secure an internship or a job. Being broke all the time meant I had to stay home, which meant I was constantly battling my parents about something. I made it, though. And yet, I want to go live on the moon. The problem with picking a school so close to home, is that you’re so close to home. Sometimes, I want to shut my phone off. I told my best friend I would make an effort to see her once a month despite school. And now that we’re coming up on our first meeting, I have very little desire to do so. That makes me feel a bit guilty. I am just in such desperate need of my own space to breathe, think, grow, that I’m willing to do anything. I have so little to write about and so little to say, as if I’ve spent the last two years of my life running a hamster wheel. Whatever. ♦

I recently started going back to my dad’s, which is forcing me to remember all the reasons I don’t like him or the environment he creates. 
Several months ago, my dad and I got into a really big argument that ended up with me staying at my mom’s all summer. If it were up to me, I would stay at my mom’s until I leave for college, but it’s not really up to me. Anyways, because of that fight my dad has been trying to make it up to me in all the wrong ways. He tried to resolve the anger I have for him with stuff that I just don’t want. All I really want is an apology, but he’s already said that he doesn’t think I deserve an apology. 
Probably the worst thing about my dad is that he’s really mean to my sister. She just turned 13, but for as long as I can remember, my dad has been picking on her for anything he takes issue with. His main thing is talking about how fat she is and how she eats too much, which has led to her to cutting out breakfast and lunch. But he just loves bullying her about EVERYTHING. Being at his place it was weird to see how he’ll get on my sister’s case about everything, but because he knows better than to talk crazy to me, he’s nice to me. It’s really unfair: My sister is too scared to stand up for herself because my dad has gotten physical with me in the past. I’m scared for her, too, so I do what I can when he’s picking on her. In reality, though, I’m leaving for college in a year and she’s gonna have to deal with him for four more years. I’ve had a lot of reasons to be scared about going away, but this just doesn’t feel like something I can “fix.” ♦

Now that I’ve returned from vacation and finished binge-watching Stranger Things, there’s more space is left in my mind to worry about starting school. 
I’m still motivated to do well in school this year, but I’m afraid I’ll fall into a negative mindset and forget my desire to succeed. My plan, to prevent negativity from creeping in, is to set milestone awards for myself, as a gift for not missing days of school or for getting a good grade on a test. My first reward is in December, when my mother, sister, and I will be going to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers play in the O2 arena. That’ll definitely keep me motivated, however I don’t think all of my rewards can be this big. Buying myself a milkshake could be an award if I wanted it to be.
I’m really excited about the concert! I’ll be surrounded by an arena full of people who like the same band as me. It’s weird to think about how many other 14-year-olds will be there, whom I don’t know, who could potentially be my friends. Sometimes, I wonder why the people similar to me are spaced out; it’s as though God wants me to search for them. Nonetheless, I’m just happy to feel included on this one night, which will make up for every day at school where I don’t feel welcome. ♦

I see this on the walk to the store near my house and it touches a deeper part of me. Words on the street are the only foreign objects I’ve been allowing to get under my epidermis. In Tompkins I wrote, “THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW HEAD SEVERS ITSELF,” even though I knew it would be washed away. The erasure is part of the comfort. 
I find a copy of The Fountainhead and a pen on the way home. Everything I find on the sidewalk means something to me but I don’t always know what it is at first. On my birthday I found a broken “LEADER” pin and kept it next to my favorite lamp until I lost it somewhere in my room. I haven’t finished a book in a while that truly touched me, maybe except for Women by Chloe Caldwell and the entire time I read that I felt like I was relating in all the wrong ways. 
I reach my house but I am not even close to where I need to be. I keep temporarily fooling myself into thinking that I am on the verge of attaining what I want, or even worse, into thinking that I know what I want. I hypnotize myself with baseless projections and the assurance that I can do it, but I don’t actually move towards any of it. I focus on ridiculous, empty parts of my life that will never have a positive impact on me: a false relationship, my terrifying inability to do anything important on time, my basket of dependencies, et cetera. 
I hate to say it, but I’m a perpetual screw-up. I won’t say it’ll get better until it does. ♦

I feel so weird!!! I am back to liking this boy I had a crush on pretty much all of junior year and I’m wondering, How did I end up here again? It’s not that he’s a bad person, he’s really great actually, but I’d convinced myself I was over him for a really long time. In retrospect, I was suppressing my feelings for him. One of my friends who wasn’t really supportive of my dreams about this boy had been telling me all summer how ugly my crush had become since school ended. So, when I came back to school and I saw him and he WASN’T ugly…everything got thrown out the window and I was back at square one. Crush 2.0. has already proven to be a lot easier though. I have a friend whom I really relate to who has been really supportive, which I’m grateful for. She’s been through it all and she has a lot of advice to offer and because I trust her, a lot of the anxiety I feel as a result of this crush is going away. 
Something else weird that’s happening is that we’re moving! My mom, sister, and I have been living in our current house for six years. This is the house I went through middle school in and that was…such a transformative time! I can’t really imagine what it’s gonna be like not to live here. My mom and stepdad have already found a new place, and we’re supposed to be out of here by the end of the month. In the last week, we gave away like ten huge IKEA bags of clothes away to Goodwill. I’ve known that we were gonna have to move for a really long time, but now that it’s actually coming up it’s becoming a lot more real. I’ve already packed up all my books and there are more boxes in my room right now that are all gonna get filled up soon. It’s not that I’m scared to be moving to another place, I just get attached really easily. I know a year from now it won’t matter, and I keep telling myself that, but it still doesn’t sit well with me. ♦

Last week, my university issued a memorandum announcing all-gender restrooms around campus. This shook University Twitter in a delightful way, and I was grinning ear to ear.
Grinning ear to ear until Monday morning when I attended my Asian History class and my professor was ranting against the aforementioned all-gender restroom memo, to my dismay. Apparently, her heteronormativity took offense to the university’s move to be inclusive. She even told the class, “I did not do anything to offend those LGBT people, but why this…this is…” Then she trailed off and shook her head, disgusted and worried about the ridiculous what-ifs she formulated in her head that a) “gay people can now freely have sex in those restrooms since it’s open for all,” b) “hetero cis women will now be deprived of their privacy,” c) “lesbians will now unleash all manner of eroticism now that nothing is censored anymore and everyone’s happy.” Bullshit. She was shaking her head the entire time, unable to believe the realness of it all. Her heteronormative, moralistic, prejudiced little bubble was shook—but not in a pleasant way.
I was so sorry to watch my respect for her go down the drain. It is one thing to have your own set of values and opinions, but it is another (and a rather out of place one at that) to flagrantly disregard the rights of other human beings just because your faith/values are challenged. She even tried to steer the conversation into “hearing the gays and lesbians out,” proceeding to ask everyone in class if there were any LGBT people present. This made my classmates scoff and look at each other maliciously (a constant in my culture!), prompting no one in particular to “come out of the closet already and be a spokesperson of the community.” Bollocks. I walked out of the classroom and went straight to the restroom to calm my nerves, I had to literally run cold water on my wrists for five minutes, it was that stressful.
A friend later asked me why I did not speak up. I told her it wasn’t my place to do that and besides, respect for everyone regardless of gender (or whatever made-up, mythical societal description) should come, must come, naturally. I can never reconcile myself with people—especially heterosexual people who have it easy—who demand explanations about something innate and intimate. My LGBTQ+ people should never be shamed for simply existing, nor be ashamed for simply being. ♦

I remember listening to this song for the first time almost four years ago, when I still had my mother and a fresh grip on being a teenager. I knew how I wanted everything to look. I knew that I wanted to have what I stupidly thought was the feeling of being in love, and I wanted my friends and I to go to house shows like the one in the video, and I wanted to be consistently creating and not crying in the shadows of my room for days, and I wanted to always feel as alive as I did in the pit or on the nights where I’d come home from a concert on an empty train. 

How do I make everything undead? How do I go back to before I killed off the best parts of myself?
I don’t want to be the fool anymore. It’s a role I play well; the bag of phantom accomplishments on my back is beginning to feel like a time bomb, heavy not only with the weight of what-could-have-been but with impending consequence. I am scared and alone. I don’t understand how I got here. 
I don’t know what to do about myself.

You don’t realize you might have no self-esteem at all until someone puts an HD camera 16 inches in front of your face and tells you to act natural.
Acting is not a foreign concept to me. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been storing at least three different screenplays in my head at once, playing every character to perfection. And even when the films were real, and not of my own creation, I was a good actress. I was better than good, I was desired. Friends sought me out for projects; sometimes they even wrote roles with me in mind.
Take for example, the role that catapulted me to mild local stardom. Last year, I starred in my friend’s movie about a girl who’d fallen in love with Jesus. It won an award at our town’s local film festival, and, in addition to a pretty big screening, we got a fair amount of press. People recognized me as Myrtle, the girl who cried over Christ’s chastity. My friends and their parents and my parents told me I should pursue acting seriously. What none of them understood was that I was not acting in that movie. I’m a girl who is insecure and sometimes introverted and a little weird when it comes to taste preferences. I’m immature and obsessive. I am the type to fall in love with Jesus. In an alternate universe, I probably have. Thus, I was not truly acting. I was merely displacing emotions. I don’t understand how no one else saw that. (But, I’m glad.)
Because of this role, I was cast in another project. This one is being made by a group of kids a lot younger than me, but far more professional, timely, and creative. My character is a bubbly, hot girl. My audition left me full of pride, but my first day of shooting has not. I stutter and miss cues and marks and want to cry a lot. It’s not that my character is two-dimensional. And while it’d be very easier to credit our differences in personality as the reason for my sense of inadequacy, we’re very much alike—outgoing, excitable, with all the qualities of an “extra” person. What I lack is my character’s deeply-rooted confidence. Confidence in her physical presence, her knowledge, her friendships and relationships. Her confidence surpasses the extent of my superficial arrogance, it bleeds into every aspect of her being.
For this reason, I fear (and know) that no amount of direction can improve my performance. I don’t open doors like a confident person would or pronounce “the” like a confident person would or know how to hug people like a confident person would.
I hope I don’t ruin this movie. I hope if I don’t ruin this movie, it makes me feel a bit more secure. ♦

I like lists and order. It’s partly to do with my dyspraxia. I’m naturally a messy person, my bedroom is a pigsty and my handwriting hasn’t changed much since I was 10. It’s because of this that I write lists and don’t draw spider diagrams. I hate spider diagrams, my brain doesn’t comprehend them properly. I remember getting told off for writing a list when we were told to draw a spider diagram. Let me take notes in a way that I can understand. A neater, less cluttered way. 
I like what I call “short-term order” as opposed to “long-term order,” which for me means that although my room is messy, when I’m getting ready in the morning I have to lay things out in the order that I’m using them. It also means that I only file things that I use a lot and that if things aren’t neat when I’m working I get uncomfortable. 
I am going to finish with a list of things that affect me as a person with dyspraxia:

 Problems with note-taking and copying information
 Background noise
 Difficulty getting started
 Memory difficulties
 Planning is difficult
 Balance and coordination issues
 Handwriting
 Limited focus
 Easily distracted. ♦

It’s currently college visit season at my school so there have been a lot of colleges coming to present about what they offer. I’ve gone to a few presentations, and a lot of them have been by schools I would have no interest in going to, such as architecture or engineering. It’s weird though because now…I’m considering what my life would be like if I was an architect or something. I think I’m feeling overwhelmed with all my options for what I could do for the rest of my life, and I don’t know why I think that adding more possibilities will make the decision easier. 
I know that I can change my major, but, I don’t know, I feel like I should just know what it is I want to do. I’m surrounded by people at school who are in computer academy, or health academy, or engineering academy and they just know what they want to do. They’ve been knowing what they want to do, since 10th grade. I thought I wanted to do computer-type things, but that didn’t really work out how I hoped it would. I guess it’s good that I know that I don’t want to be a computer scientist, but that doesn’t really help guide me toward what I want to do. I want to do jobs that involve a lot of risk for success, like film or media, or art, or fashion, so I really have to be sure I’m good so that I don’t end up in a desk job that I hate. It feels like I’m running out of time, especially when my close friends have their lives planned 10 years into the future. I just want to have some sense of security. ♦

School has been a lot more demanding than I’d imagined. I am currently in the midst of my foundation year, so I’m taking a bunch of art, design, and technology courses. It’s weird, being back. The dynamic of the school has changed a little bit. Time is also flying, and it seems like it’s getting harder and harder to stay ahead of the work I’m supposed to do. I’m not a very organized person and I’ve been trying to balance everything, which isn’t easy! 
I’ve also been thinking a lot about how being at a liberal arts college can be sheltering, and the implications of that. Just outside this campus, the whole world is on fire. Here I am, with all these responsibilities, but none that truly feel important. You find yourself in the midst of another death, another race conversation where you scream and shout, but for what? It’s monotonous. I’m not trying to be rude or discouraging, but it just becomes enough. The President of our college sent out an email comparing police brutality to the violence in Chicago, which felt insincere and silly. I’m not complacent about these issues, but I’m at a supreme level of eye-rolling right now. All I can focus on is keeping my head down and killing my classes. I’m on academic probation, so it’s not a game. 
The great thing is that I’m starting to link up with more likeminded people. Out of the frustration among Black students comes a sense of community. I’m trying to reach out and be more involved in campus activities, including bringing films and musicians here. Standing in the background and complaining about the lack of diversity isn’t going to do anything—we’ve all come to that conclusion. So, for me, it’s important my voice be heard. Even if I don’t know what I’m doing in terms of bringing people here, I’m determined to learn on the job and milk this institution for all that it’s worth. That’s what it is, an institution. Once people realize that, they’ll be a lot better off. That’s not to say you can’t challenge your schools, or want more, but they also exist to make money. I want to get to a place where I can better balance schoolwork and lay a foundation on campus for more inclusive programs. I also just want to have fun. Fun thus far has been late night trips to Popeye’s and sneaking into the academic buildings at night to watch Flavor of Love episodes on the projector. ♦

This week has been driven by sick, with a sore throat and mucous jaws coming for me at the very beginning and a bout of nostalgia complete with rotting layers of skin and new old memories finalizing the Great Ill. It is almost over, only to begin again. I used to think that cycles gave you chances to right wrongs, but if anything, it forces you to add to the list of missteps, with a gold star moment or two thrown in between the series of screw-ups. I love learning that I haven’t learned. I don’t look to people for constants anymore, but to my own bad habits and somewhat deficient common sense. 
For once in my life it feels strange to be talking so openly about what a blemish I can be, and I wonder why I do it—why I talk so much about myself and what other people must think of me and what a joke I must sound like. I don’t write about any of the good things I do. I only talk about my happiness when it involves another and that disgusts me, not in a beautifully repulsive way but in a “stop being so dependent” way. Except even then I didn’t acknowledge that I’ve already acknowledged this in real life! I’ve begun to learn. I already took my mental notes on this lesson.
Maybe it’s that I feel the good is sacred and the bad is public domain. I wrote a whole post on disliking how I’ve been defined by all my tragedies and how angry it made me when my college advisor became perhaps the hundredth adult to tell me that I was lucky to have such a “good story” (meaning that my life would be a pain to live but an enjoyable pain to consume from the safety of a seat in Barnes & Noble or in bed with both of your parents in the next room). Except, the thing is, my default is defining myself by my tragedies. This is a bit of a personal jawdropper for me because I antagonize others for forcing this image onto me but I play into it without fully realizing it. As I am writing this, this is the first time I have fully confronted this fact. So what now?
All I can do to save face is be more conscious, and change the narrative. Everything is not all good, but everything is not all bad. (Duh!) Today is a safe kind of emptiness, where I am not smiling or forcing myself to laugh if I don’t think something is that funny, but it feels good. I am not being artificial towards myself or others. I am remaining positive while maintaining realism, instead of moping or trying to pretend that everything is [insert one-sided emotion]. I am OK. I am content. For the past few days, I’ve been shockingly happy, and today I am content. It doesn’t feel lesser and I like that. I think I can be ridiculous, but I like myself. This is where I am. Moving up and across and sometimes backwards and sometimes very much downwards and then up, up, up again. ♦

Crossing the bridge between sleeping and waking has become harder. I doze off at the wrong hour, sometimes in the wrong places. I forget what it was like to have a restful sleep, and uniform breathing that leaves you refreshed and calm in the morning.
I’m always tired and upset; tired of everyone, upset about everything. Finals are underway and three professors have assigned us performance pieces as a substitute for the written final exams. This situation is stressful for me because I loathe group work, especially when those in the group are passive-aggressive, careless jerks. There was an instance last week when I tried to lead them into coming up with a decision—a decision that’s better based on group thinking than on a single mind—and to my dismay no one even bothered to answer. Pure silence via a “seen by everyone” Messenger status.
This is when I don’t find introversion a redeeming quality. University work and all the hours required for me to “show up, stand up, speak out” are draining the life out of me, conspicuously. When I get home and immediately sleep without even taking my school uniform off, then that’s it, I’m tired to the bone.
I wonder why the majority of the people I’ve been groupmates with in recent projects are docile and dormant. I think age difference might be a culprit, since my age is that of the usual college graduate. I would have been a senior now had I not dropped out and delayed a year of schooling. At present, I’m carrying sophomore status, even though I’ve taken almost all of the required sophomore courses (university rules are mad confusing), which is also how I happened to be stuck with 16, 17-ish young people at present. So then, maybe age difference is a contributing factor to their passive-aggressiveness (which is so sophomore me, two years ago) and that my being so stressed and un-chill about school projects and group work is because of my being a “senior at soul and heart.” Aren’t the younguns supposed to be full of vitality, while the oldie senior students are devoid of life and even robot-like? If this is the case, then I can’t wait to see what I look and feel like when I become a legit senior. ♦

I don’t mind flying, but that’s probably because I don’t do it often enough. As a child, it was glamorous and exciting because it meant the luxury of vacation. With age, I’ve become accustomed to its more practical purposes, like a trip to see family, and thus, less impressed by recycled air and synchronized seat belt demonstration. However, there is something that always makes me marvel at air travel. 
Generally, I am easygoing person. My fears are superstitious and personal. At a very young age, I realized the “this could happen to you” narrative the news media spurts out in the wake of freak tragedy was designed to harness anxiety and keep up ratings. 
With this reasoning, it wouldn’t make much sense for me to fear an airplane. But there is nothing, and I mean nothing, more terrifying than the ascent of an aircraft. Specifically, any Boeing model whose name starts with a seven. Seated and locked in, with no possibility of escape; it is puzzling, fearful, nail-biting. It seems against the laws of nature that such a beast—filled with passengers, and cargo, and frozen tilapia cutlets in tin foil—could lift off the ground and stay off the ground, for hours at a time. When the second half (my half) of the plane lifts from the ground, my stomach churns in steady motion until houses are nothing but specks under clouded mist, and I’ve been impressed by the airline’s extensive offerings of Spike Jonze films. 
There is a great deal of trust in my abiding to my seat and silence and sanity during take off. I suppose this is true for everyone. The collective conviction of passengers on the plane prevents uprising and meltdowns in the seconds before departure. It keeps the planes operating on schedule. It maintains order in the world. I, along with everyone else, must trust that my plane will lift and fly and land safely, and that science is truth, even when I’ve just written a paper for philosophy concerning the nonexistence of truths.
I trusted an airplane this past weekend on a trip to my cousin’s wedding. We lifted, and flew, and landed safely.* Trust is very powerful. 
*Do note, my luggage was left behind. ♦

I start small. I ask someone for help on a physics problem. “Yeah, of course, I could use a break from my astro homework,” she says, and then, “oh god, do I even remember kinematics?” We work it out together step by step and laugh uproariously at our mistakes. I ask someone else to proofread a short essay before I turn it in online. “Yeah, yeah, sure,” she says, distractedly, and when I turn my computer to face her she scrunches up her nose. “Can it be, like, later? I’m kind of busy.” I am learning who my friends are.
Sometimes, I feel like I learned all the wrong things in high school—pride, secrecy, hypercompetitiveness. A substitute teacher I had in a calculus class once said something along the lines of: “If this doesn’t come easily to you, then I for one don’t want you building my bridges and healing my children.” Asking for help was a show of weakness, a failure of intuition—especially in science and math courses. If you want to spin that a positive way, it taught me independence, right? Problem solving, using different approaches, figuring shit out on my own. But my sense of academic independence is so pronounced that I’ll sit 20 meters from my astronomy professor’s open door and agonize over the homework by myself because I can’t bring myself to admit that I simply don’t understand. At college, it’s even easier to ask for help than it was in high school—in theory. In practice it is just as hard, and maybe harder, because I am still trying to learn how best to stand out.
But it’s funny, because while I’ve always been more comfortable in my “academic skin,” so to speak, I feel a lot better about the balance I’m striking outside of the classroom. I don’t have a lot of friends, but I also don’t care about sitting alone at dinner anymore. I am finding places where I can be vulnerable—I go to a meeting of my college’s queer union and find myself opening up about things I had never before said out loud. Later my friend says she’s proud of me and I tell her thanks, and then I’m like, “So, about this other physics problem…”
I am learning to prioritize. And when my desire to succeed takes priority over my pride, I will find help. ♦

The realization that the week is almost over is less of a relief, more of a mimicry of the way I suddenly wake up fully clothed in the middle of the night, trying to figure out how much time I have to organize myself and trying to collect what I have missed and appear less disoriented. It is never a satisfying end, because it is not one; it is a bump in a cycle, an anti-climax. Every time I fall for it, waiting shakily for the next Thursday to Friday stretch, and the next, and the next. Being a fool-ess is what keeps me alive. Ignorance becomes less about bliss and more about survival. 
Jenny Holzer returns to me when I am writing one of my college essays. IN A DREAM YOU SAW A WAY TO SURVIVE AND YOU WERE FULL OF JOY. Or, more appropriate for my daily life: THE BREAKDOWN COMES WHEN YOU STOP CONTROLLING YOURSELF AND WANT THE RELEASE OF A BLOODBATH. SPIT ON SOMEONE WITH A MOUTHFUL OF MILK IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT HIS PERSONALITY FAST. She is everything to me, and I mean this literally, not some half-formed instance of idolatry; she is the sum of my fears and abuses and primal desires and self-studies. I am constantly astounded that one person can not only mean so much to me but be so much. She is a light in a world where my enemies have good excuses and I am fighting to get out of the crawlspace. 
At a few points in time, I would have said something along the lines of wanting to provide that kind of guidance, practice her brand of encapsulation. But I don’t know if I could handle it, or accept it. My friend told me yesterday that a girl in our school was telling her that she spent the summer reading my diaries and I couldn’t believe her. It wasn’t a lie, but I did not—and do not—have the ability to consume the thought of someone admiring or relating to my work without a barrage of assaults on myself following suit. I’m being silly, but at least I know that I am. 
Is self-awareness really everything? Everyone I’ve talked to about it seems to think so. I don’t think I need to rank it, only acknowledge its extreme importance—if I try to order it or make claims on its behalf I know that I will look back and have at least one regret. That’s it: minimizing the chance for regret. That’s one of the biggest things to keep in mind, although acting on it is harder than the simple revelation of it. I can’t rank my fears either, but one of the biggest is dramatically being on my death bed in the last scene of my life and thinking about what I could have done. I hate that thought! I’ll do anything to avoid having it. ♦

I’m so excited. I have to shoot a scene that resembles earlier films made by the Lumière brothers for my history class. It’s nothing fancy. The shot will be 30 seconds and I’ll only be shooting from one angle, but I’m just happy I get to create a film in general. My old advisor swore up and down that I wouldn’t like being a film and screen studies major, and that I wouldn’t get to do any hands-on work if I transferred schools, but look at me now. Joke’s on him. I’m having trouble finding actors for it, but I’m sure one of my friends will pull through this week.
I keep seeing all these lukewarm reviews of Frank Ocean’s (other) album, Endless. I’m falling in love with it in the same way that I feel like I’m in a hazy, sad but victorious dream when I listen to Blonde. It just took me a little longer to build that same affection with Endless. I wish there was an actual album for it so the video didn’t kill my battery. The song “Alabama” reminds me of tumultuous yet funny moments in my childhood that affect the relationships I have with people today. I feel way less alone and crazy when I listen to both of these projects. If Blonde is a foggy dream surrounding my being, Endless feels like my emotions dripping down my face in the form of sweet honey.
I’ve been praying even though I’m not sure I believe in God. Between police shootings and the bomb that went off not to far from my dorm, I’ve been crying for the past two weeks. I worry about my family. I worry about myself. I worry about my friend who slightly resembles the suspect that appeared on my phone through one of those tri-state area alerts. I texted him reminding him to be aware of his surroundings and to be safe. It almost sent me back to being the person I was when I was 13. I promised myself and others that I wouldn’t open up that chapter of my life again. So I pray. 
Anxiety quietly sneaks into bed with me in middle of the night to harass me in the morning. These aren’t things I can talk about with a therapist. My worst nightmares can’t be washed down and silenced with prescription drugs. I don’t put sugar in my tea anymore unless it’s black, is that a sign of true adulthood? I apologized to past lovers for not being open enough or “shut off.” I was just trying to protect them. I still struggle with not seeing myself as anything more than a problem, but I’ve gotten much better at it. I do think I’m worthy of respect and love from friends, and I accept compliments with a smile. Now I’m listening to Endless again, crying to “Rushes To,” and I don’t know how I’m going to feel tomorrow or next week but I do hope I find some middle ground in all of this. ♦

I am a college student now! Lo and behold, with nearly a week under my belt, here are my reflections:
I brought exactly five books with me to college: Contact by Carl Sagan, Ender’s Game by Orson Scott Card, Nine Stories by J. D. Salinger, First Test by Tamora Pierce, and Dune by Frank Herbert. With the exception of the last (which I have yet to read) these books all have something in common: They have taught me how to think, or how I would like to think; how to approach situations; how to come at things from new angles; how to block out internal stimuli that prevent me from functioning my best and carry on. I think that’s important to hold onto, especially when you’re in a new place. The downside is that many of these books have taught me, especially, how to block out my own feelings, which leads me to my second point.
I still have a lot of emotions surrounding religion/faith/spirituality. The two or three times one of the school’s chaplains has taken the stage during a lecture session—be it to welcome us to the school, talk about multiculturalism, or simply to bring our attention to the school’s Center for Religious and Spiritual Life—I have found myself grinding my teeth to hide the tears. I don’t know why! Something about the topic just leaves me more vulnerable than I’d like to be. Last week, I talked a little about the intersection of faith and science and how I am still struggling to find a balance that I can work with, and I don’t know if that struggle will stop anytime soon. My family is not religious—I know I grew up identifying with the term “agnostic”—but in the past few years especially I have found faith appealing. Not necessarily a strict pursuit of a certain religion (although, of course, to each their own) but to have something definite to believe in. Right now, enough is indefinite in my life that last week’s “oh, well, I believe in something!” no longer holds when I need it to. I thought I could let it go without taking action. Now I see that if I want the guidance I thought that notion would offer me, I need to seek out the answers myself. And I can’t let their existence be in question anymore. If anything, I have to believe that those answers are out there somewhere.
I did not cry when my parents left. I almost did—four, five times. But I didn’t. I met my roommate and we went to see a comedian who was performing on campus and I came back to our room and I slept.
I think I am making friends—slowly, excruciatingly, but I am forcing myself out of my comfort zone, I am talking to people, I am making myself vulnerable to them. We’ve all been going to modules about “what matters” at our campus: alcohol safety, sexual violence awareness, diversity of all kinds. Today we also split into groups of six or seven within our orientation groups to discuss what we had just learned and half an hour later two people, including me, had come out to the entire group. I’ve been “out” in some fashion for years and it was still scary! These things are scary! The school I’m going to is heavily liberal and we’re all encouraged to introduce ourselves with our preferred names and pronouns and if anything, I should feel even safer here than I did at my high school—and I was still afraid. But I did it. I talked to the other kid afterward and now we’re planning to go to an LGBTQ event together on the last day of orientation—so sometimes being vulnerable leads to good things. But that does not stop the fear.
I do have my reasons to be happy. I met with my advisor this week, who also teaches one of my classes, and he helped me make all of the changes to my schedule that I had been crossing my fingers for since I received my first tentative outline. In the spring, I sat in on an astronomy class that basically sealed the deal on my attending this school, and now, this fall, I’ll be able to take that same course—from the same professor, no less. Will I be overworked? With three science courses, two with labs, and an accelerated language course—yes, that’s another lab—it’s safe to say that I’m probably in over my head. But here’s another thing I have to believe: I have to believe it will be worth it. ♦

Sometimes, I feel like everything I write about is trite and stupid and complain-y and redundant because it’s been said a million times before and probably better. And half the time, I’m right. But right now I want to discuss something often ignored. It involves my butt and stuff coming out of it. 
Yes, poop. Everybody poops. It just so happens my bowels are particularly responsive to my personal circumstance.
To offer perspective, my first Halloween memory involves my mother delivering me an enema. I hadn’t pooped in three days, and was told I could not trick-or-treat until I passed a substantial bowel movement. And for some reason, despite the fiber shoved down my mouth, and cushiony toilet seat made available for my usage, I couldn’t complete the task. (Until the enema, of course.) I’m not sure if I was suffering from some kind of health problem. 
On the other hand, when I was 11, during my first summer of sleep away camp, I stopped pooping entirely—for about six days. Maybe it was the toxicity bred by a hormonal environment in which mirror time and outlet access were a battle, or maybe I was just feeling unfamiliar in a new place. I know that.
Today, regularity is no longer a problem, but access is. I cannot poop anywhere but my house. I cannot poop anywhere that doesn’t have baby wipes available for post-fecal cleansing. Pooping, for me, requires routine and consistency. There must be familiarity involved. Yes, vacations are lovely, but they slowly descend into prolonged periods of holding in poop. I do enjoy seeing my family, but I just can’t function correctly in their presence, upon their potties. Toilet security requires conditioning and experience. I worry this will hinder my experiences in life. 
In the same way that Soylent could hypothetically reverse my fears that my careless diet will lead to my demise, I hope one day pooping becomes as routine, unemotional, objective as liquid food. ♦

On Friday night, there was a terrorist attack in Davao, the city where I live. The bombing took place at a night market adjacent to my university. A lot of lives were lost, mostly masseuses who were just trying to make a living that night.
I’m sitting here trying to make sense of what just happened, if ever I can make sense of it. A lot of speculation is being thrown all over news channels as to what larger motive was behind the attack, but I know that whoever planned it and whatever the reason was, it is not justifiable by saying it was a means to an end. Taking an innocent life is not a logical means to an end that could be achieved through discourse.
The strain and paranoia caused by the attack is felt in the veins of my city. Usually, on Saturdays, everyone fills up the city streets, but on the day following the Friday night incident, the streets were devoid of people and vehicles. Everyone is inside their houses watching the news and probably trying to make sense of what happened and mourning the loss and injury of the 81 victims.
I can’t imagine how people in war-stricken countries live like this every day, to fear for your every move in a place you once considered safe and dearly called home. Now my city, the comfort basket that cradles me and tucks me in whenever I’m lonely, will never be the same again. No matter the repairs, or how many military and police troops are on guard, or how many prayers are sent, it will never be the same again. ♦

Seven tips for writing:
1. Don’t plagiarize.
Earlier today, when I was stuck for writing inspiration and worrying about handing in a piece for Rookie, my best friend asked me if i wanted to just use some of her work. Our conversation went as follows:
Her: If you want to use anything I write, you’re more than welcome. I really don’t mind.
Me: Becca, noooo. That’s very sweet but also wrong. I may not have many morals, but when it comes to writing…
Her: …
Me: I have at least seven.
Her: Specifically seven?!
Me: Well…I just made that up, but sure, let me think.
And here we have the first rule, don’t plagiarize, even your best friend’s work, especially your best friend’s work.
2. Don’t apologize for writing.
This is something we do all the time, especially young femmes, girls, and women. We apologize for our words because that’s how we’ve been conditioned. “It’s not very good,” “It’s a bit too long,” “I’ve done better,” are all ways to excuse ourselves from what we’ve written. We don’t need to do that, we apologize enough in our lives, don’t be sorry for writing.
3. All hard work is good work, but not all good work is hard work.
This one might need a bit of explaining. What it means is if you work hard, that’s enough. I don’t care who says it isn’t, if you’re trying your best then your work is good enough. Saying that, sometimes inspiration just appears and writing becomes effortless, easy; this doesn’t mean your work is not good enough, it just means you had a good day.
4. To be inspired is amazing, to inspire is bloody brilliant.
This “rule” is one Becca gave me after I told her that she inspired me. I can’t disagree. It’s an amazing feeling to be inspired, to be able to understand things and create or have new ideas. Knowing that you inspire others is on another level, because that feeling is something you’re giving to others—to people like you.
5. It has probably been written before, but it’s never been written by you.
This doesn’t sound that motivational, but it’s really hard to find new ground. You, however, are unique, and by extension, so is your art. You may not be the only teenager writing about a zombie apocalypse, but nobody is writing about your zombie apocalypse. Don’t be scared that your idea has been written about already; if it’s from you it’s a totally different piece.
6. Just write SOMETHING.
It doesn’t matter what, just anything. It might be utter garbage, it might also be your next masterpiece. That’s the best thing to do when you have a block, write anyway. Eventually you’ll reach a eureka moment, things will click into place.
7. Someone cares.
This one is important: You could be writing for an audience of thousands, for your best friend or just for yourself. It doesn’t matter, because the point is someone cares. You might not even know it, they might not even know it. But someone out there appreciates what you do. And there’s always a possibility that more people will, too. ♦

I’m settling back into school, I can’t believe that I’m entering my sophomore year. I moved in on the Sunday before last, which was stressful in and of itself. My roommate seems cool, although she never seems to leave the room. I’m not sure I could ever see my dorm room as my home, so it’s always surprising to me when people take up residence in temporary spaces as if they plan to live there forever. I never want to bring in too much stuff, because I know eventually, the process of moving it all out will be super time-consuming. I have a method: I have around five bins, containing my clothes, books, and other belongings. When it’s time to leave, I’ll just put everything back in the bins, which makes for easy transportation. 
I don’t really enjoy any of my classes, but they’re better than the ones from last year. For once, I feel challenged, especially in my design class. My professor and I share many of the same interests. She’s from Zimbabwe. Last semester, everyone was telling me how mean she is. I went in kinda nervous, but soon realized she isn’t mean, she just commands a lot of respect. Often, students use free reign to discuss design concepts as an invitation to teach the class. She’s an ASAP Rocky stan, which is refreshing, I’m happy to know “Live. Love. ASAP” affected someone as deeply as it did me. 
I’m dealing with a flurry of emotions. Relief that I made it out the other side of a very tough summer. It was very, very tough dealing with being back home, not getting along with my father, losing my grandfather, personal failures such as inability to secure an internship or a job. Being broke all the time meant I had to stay home, which meant I was constantly battling my parents about something. I made it, though. And yet, I want to go live on the moon. The problem with picking a school so close to home, is that you’re so close to home. Sometimes, I want to shut my phone off. I told my best friend I would make an effort to see her once a month despite school. And now that we’re coming up on our first meeting, I have very little desire to do so. That makes me feel a bit guilty. I am just in such desperate need of my own space to breathe, think, grow, that I’m willing to do anything. I have so little to write about and so little to say, as if I’ve spent the last two years of my life running a hamster wheel. Whatever. ♦

I recently started going back to my dad’s, which is forcing me to remember all the reasons I don’t like him or the environment he creates. 
Several months ago, my dad and I got into a really big argument that ended up with me staying at my mom’s all summer. If it were up to me, I would stay at my mom’s until I leave for college, but it’s not really up to me. Anyways, because of that fight my dad has been trying to make it up to me in all the wrong ways. He tried to resolve the anger I have for him with stuff that I just don’t want. All I really want is an apology, but he’s already said that he doesn’t think I deserve an apology. 
Probably the worst thing about my dad is that he’s really mean to my sister. She just turned 13, but for as long as I can remember, my dad has been picking on her for anything he takes issue with. His main thing is talking about how fat she is and how she eats too much, which has led to her to cutting out breakfast and lunch. But he just loves bullying her about EVERYTHING. Being at his place it was weird to see how he’ll get on my sister’s case about everything, but because he knows better than to talk crazy to me, he’s nice to me. It’s really unfair: My sister is too scared to stand up for herself because my dad has gotten physical with me in the past. I’m scared for her, too, so I do what I can when he’s picking on her. In reality, though, I’m leaving for college in a year and she’s gonna have to deal with him for four more years. I’ve had a lot of reasons to be scared about going away, but this just doesn’t feel like something I can “fix.” ♦

Now that I’ve returned from vacation and finished binge-watching Stranger Things, there’s more space is left in my mind to worry about starting school. 
I’m still motivated to do well in school this year, but I’m afraid I’ll fall into a negative mindset and forget my desire to succeed. My plan, to prevent negativity from creeping in, is to set milestone awards for myself, as a gift for not missing days of school or for getting a good grade on a test. My first reward is in December, when my mother, sister, and I will be going to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers play in the O2 arena. That’ll definitely keep me motivated, however I don’t think all of my rewards can be this big. Buying myself a milkshake could be an award if I wanted it to be.
I’m really excited about the concert! I’ll be surrounded by an arena full of people who like the same band as me. It’s weird to think about how many other 14-year-olds will be there, whom I don’t know, who could potentially be my friends. Sometimes, I wonder why the people similar to me are spaced out; it’s as though God wants me to search for them. Nonetheless, I’m just happy to feel included on this one night, which will make up for every day at school where I don’t feel welcome. ♦

7” SHALLOW CUT
NO SAW SPUN
I see this on the walk to the store near my house and it touches a deeper part of me. Words on the street are the only foreign objects I’ve been allowing to get under my epidermis. In Tompkins I wrote, “THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW HEAD SEVERS ITSELF,” even though I knew it would be washed away. The erasure is part of the comfort. 
I find a copy of The Fountainhead and a pen on the way home. Everything I find on the sidewalk means something to me but I don’t always know what it is at first. On my birthday I found a broken “LEADER” pin and kept it next to my favorite lamp until I lost it somewhere in my room. I haven’t finished a book in a while that truly touched me, maybe except for Women by Chloe Caldwell and the entire time I read that I felt like I was relating in all the wrong ways. 
I reach my house but I am not even close to where I need to be. I keep temporarily fooling myself into thinking that I am on the verge of attaining what I want, or even worse, into thinking that I know what I want. I hypnotize myself with baseless projections and the assurance that I can do it, but I don’t actually move towards any of it. I focus on ridiculous, empty parts of my life that will never have a positive impact on me: a false relationship, my terrifying inability to do anything important on time, my basket of dependencies, et cetera. 
I hate to say it, but I’m a perpetual screw-up. I won’t say it’ll get better until it does. ♦

I feel so weird!!! I am back to liking this boy I had a crush on pretty much all of junior year and I’m wondering, How did I end up here again? It’s not that he’s a bad person, he’s really great actually, but I’d convinced myself I was over him for a really long time. In retrospect, I was suppressing my feelings for him. One of my friends who wasn’t really supportive of my dreams about this boy had been telling me all summer how ugly my crush had become since school ended. So, when I came back to school and I saw him and he WASN’T ugly…everything got thrown out the window and I was back at square one. Crush 2.0. has already proven to be a lot easier though. I have a friend whom I really relate to who has been really supportive, which I’m grateful for. She’s been through it all and she has a lot of advice to offer and because I trust her, a lot of the anxiety I feel as a result of this crush is going away. 
Something else weird that’s happening is that we’re moving! My mom, sister, and I have been living in our current house for six years. This is the house I went through middle school in and that was…such a transformative time! I can’t really imagine what it’s gonna be like not to live here. My mom and stepdad have already found a new place, and we’re supposed to be out of here by the end of the month. In the last week, we gave away like ten huge IKEA bags of clothes away to Goodwill. I’ve known that we were gonna have to move for a really long time, but now that it’s actually coming up it’s becoming a lot more real. I’ve already packed up all my books and there are more boxes in my room right now that are all gonna get filled up soon. It’s not that I’m scared to be moving to another place, I just get attached really easily. I know a year from now it won’t matter, and I keep telling myself that, but it still doesn’t sit well with me. ♦

Last week, my university issued a memorandum announcing all-gender restrooms around campus. This shook University Twitter in a delightful way, and I was grinning ear to ear.
Grinning ear to ear until Monday morning when I attended my Asian History class and my professor was ranting against the aforementioned all-gender restroom memo, to my dismay. Apparently, her heteronormativity took offense to the university’s move to be inclusive. She even told the class, “I did not do anything to offend those LGBT people, but why this…this is…” Then she trailed off and shook her head, disgusted and worried about the ridiculous what-ifs she formulated in her head that a) “gay people can now freely have sex in those restrooms since it’s open for all,” b) “hetero cis women will now be deprived of their privacy,” c) “lesbians will now unleash all manner of eroticism now that nothing is censored anymore and everyone’s happy.” Bullshit. She was shaking her head the entire time, unable to believe the realness of it all. Her heteronormative, moralistic, prejudiced little bubble was shook—but not in a pleasant way.
I was so sorry to watch my respect for her go down the drain. It is one thing to have your own set of values and opinions, but it is another (and a rather out of place one at that) to flagrantly disregard the rights of other human beings just because your faith/values are challenged. She even tried to steer the conversation into “hearing the gays and lesbians out,” proceeding to ask everyone in class if there were any LGBT people present. This made my classmates scoff and look at each other maliciously (a constant in my culture!), prompting no one in particular to “come out of the closet already and be a spokesperson of the community.” Bollocks. I walked out of the classroom and went straight to the restroom to calm my nerves, I had to literally run cold water on my wrists for five minutes, it was that stressful.
A friend later asked me why I did not speak up. I told her it wasn’t my place to do that and besides, respect for everyone regardless of gender (or whatever made-up, mythical societal description) should come, must come, naturally. I can never reconcile myself with people—especially heterosexual people who have it easy—who demand explanations about something innate and intimate. My LGBTQ+ people should never be shamed for simply existing, nor be ashamed for simply being. ♦

I remember listening to this song for the first time almost four years ago, when I still had my mother and a fresh grip on being a teenager. I knew how I wanted everything to look. I knew that I wanted to have what I stupidly thought was the feeling of being in love, and I wanted my friends and I to go to house shows like the one in the video, and I wanted to be consistently creating and not crying in the shadows of my room for days, and I wanted to always feel as alive as I did in the pit or on the nights where I’d come home from a concert on an empty train. 

How do I make everything undead? How do I go back to before I killed off the best parts of myself?
I don’t want to be the fool anymore. It’s a role I play well; the bag of phantom accomplishments on my back is beginning to feel like a time bomb, heavy not only with the weight of what-could-have-been but with impending consequence. I am scared and alone. I don’t understand how I got here. 
I don’t know what to do about myself.
I don’t know what to do. ♦

You don’t realize you might have no self-esteem at all until someone puts an HD camera 16 inches in front of your face and tells you to act natural.
Acting is not a foreign concept to me. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been storing at least three different screenplays in my head at once, playing every character to perfection. And even when the films were real, and not of my own creation, I was a good actress. I was better than good, I was desired. Friends sought me out for projects; sometimes they even wrote roles with me in mind.
Take for example, the role that catapulted me to mild local stardom. Last year, I starred in my friend’s movie about a girl who’d fallen in love with Jesus. It won an award at our town’s local film festival, and, in addition to a pretty big screening, we got a fair amount of press. People recognized me as Myrtle, the girl who cried over Christ’s chastity. My friends and their parents and my parents told me I should pursue acting seriously. What none of them understood was that I was not acting in that movie. I’m a girl who is insecure and sometimes introverted and a little weird when it comes to taste preferences. I’m immature and obsessive. I am the type to fall in love with Jesus. In an alternate universe, I probably have. Thus, I was not truly acting. I was merely displacing emotions. I don’t understand how no one else saw that. (But, I’m glad.)
Because of this role, I was cast in another project. This one is being made by a group of kids a lot younger than me, but far more professional, timely, and creative. My character is a bubbly, hot girl. My audition left me full of pride, but my first day of shooting has not. I stutter and miss cues and marks and want to cry a lot. It’s not that my character is two-dimensional. And while it’d be very easier to credit our differences in personality as the reason for my sense of inadequacy, we’re very much alike—outgoing, excitable, with all the qualities of an “extra” person. What I lack is my character’s deeply-rooted confidence. Confidence in her physical presence, her knowledge, her friendships and relationships. Her confidence surpasses the extent of my superficial arrogance, it bleeds into every aspect of her being.
For this reason, I fear (and know) that no amount of direction can improve my performance. I don’t open doors like a confident person would or pronounce “the” like a confident person would or know how to hug people like a confident person would.
I hope I don’t ruin this movie. I hope if I don’t ruin this movie, it makes me feel a bit more secure. ♦

I like lists and order. It’s partly to do with my dyspraxia. I’m naturally a messy person, my bedroom is a pigsty and my handwriting hasn’t changed much since I was 10. It’s because of this that I write lists and don’t draw spider diagrams. I hate spider diagrams, my brain doesn’t comprehend them properly. I remember getting told off for writing a list when we were told to draw a spider diagram. Let me take notes in a way that I can understand. A neater, less cluttered way. 
I like what I call “short-term order” as opposed to “long-term order,” which for me means that although my room is messy, when I’m getting ready in the morning I have to lay things out in the order that I’m using them. It also means that I only file things that I use a lot and that if things aren’t neat when I’m working I get uncomfortable. 
I am going to finish with a list of things that affect me as a person with dyspraxia:

 Problems with note-taking and copying information
 Background noise
 Difficulty getting started
 Memory difficulties
 Planning is difficult
 Balance and coordination issues
 Handwriting
 Limited focus
 Easily distracted. ♦

It’s currently college visit season at my school so there have been a lot of colleges coming to present about what they offer. I’ve gone to a few presentations, and a lot of them have been by schools I would have no interest in going to, such as architecture or engineering. It’s weird though because now…I’m considering what my life would be like if I was an architect or something. I think I’m feeling overwhelmed with all my options for what I could do for the rest of my life, and I don’t know why I think that adding more possibilities will make the decision easier. 
I know that I can change my major, but, I don’t know, I feel like I should just know what it is I want to do. I’m surrounded by people at school who are in computer academy, or health academy, or engineering academy and they just know what they want to do. They’ve been knowing what they want to do, since 10th grade. I thought I wanted to do computer-type things, but that didn’t really work out how I hoped it would. I guess it’s good that I know that I don’t want to be a computer scientist, but that doesn’t really help guide me toward what I want to do. I want to do jobs that involve a lot of risk for success, like film or media, or art, or fashion, so I really have to be sure I’m good so that I don’t end up in a desk job that I hate. It feels like I’m running out of time, especially when my close friends have their lives planned 10 years into the future. I just want to have some sense of security. ♦

School has been a lot more demanding than I’d imagined. I am currently in the midst of my foundation year, so I’m taking a bunch of art, design, and technology courses. It’s weird, being back. The dynamic of the school has changed a little bit. Time is also flying, and it seems like it’s getting harder and harder to stay ahead of the work I’m supposed to do. I’m not a very organized person and I’ve been trying to balance everything, which isn’t easy! 
I’ve also been thinking a lot about how being at a liberal arts college can be sheltering, and the implications of that. Just outside this campus, the whole world is on fire. Here I am, with all these responsibilities, but none that truly feel important. You find yourself in the midst of another death, another race conversation where you scream and shout, but for what? It’s monotonous. I’m not trying to be rude or discouraging, but it just becomes enough. The President of our college sent out an email comparing police brutality to the violence in Chicago, which felt insincere and silly. I’m not complacent about these issues, but I’m at a supreme level of eye-rolling right now. All I can focus on is keeping my head down and killing my classes. I’m on academic probation, so it’s not a game. 
The great thing is that I’m starting to link up with more likeminded people. Out of the frustration among Black students comes a sense of community. I’m trying to reach out and be more involved in campus activities, including bringing films and musicians here. Standing in the background and complaining about the lack of diversity isn’t going to do anything—we’ve all come to that conclusion. So, for me, it’s important my voice be heard. Even if I don’t know what I’m doing in terms of bringing people here, I’m determined to learn on the job and milk this institution for all that it’s worth. That’s what it is, an institution. Once people realize that, they’ll be a lot better off. That’s not to say you can’t challenge your schools, or want more, but they also exist to make money. I want to get to a place where I can better balance schoolwork and lay a foundation on campus for more inclusive programs. I also just want to have fun. Fun thus far has been late night trips to Popeye’s and sneaking into the academic buildings at night to watch Flavor of Love episodes on the projector. ♦

This week has been driven by sick, with a sore throat and mucous jaws coming for me at the very beginning and a bout of nostalgia complete with rotting layers of skin and new old memories finalizing the Great Ill. It is almost over, only to begin again. I used to think that cycles gave you chances to right wrongs, but if anything, it forces you to add to the list of missteps, with a gold star moment or two thrown in between the series of screw-ups. I love learning that I haven’t learned. I don’t look to people for constants anymore, but to my own bad habits and somewhat deficient common sense. 
For once in my life it feels strange to be talking so openly about what a blemish I can be, and I wonder why I do it—why I talk so much about myself and what other people must think of me and what a joke I must sound like. I don’t write about any of the good things I do. I only talk about my happiness when it involves another and that disgusts me, not in a beautifully repulsive way but in a “stop being so dependent” way. Except even then I didn’t acknowledge that I’ve already acknowledged this in real life! I’ve begun to learn. I already took my mental notes on this lesson.
Maybe it’s that I feel the good is sacred and the bad is public domain. I wrote a whole post on disliking how I’ve been defined by all my tragedies and how angry it made me when my college advisor became perhaps the hundredth adult to tell me that I was lucky to have such a “good story” (meaning that my life would be a pain to live but an enjoyable pain to consume from the safety of a seat in Barnes & Noble or in bed with both of your parents in the next room). Except, the thing is, my default is defining myself by my tragedies. This is a bit of a personal jawdropper for me because I antagonize others for forcing this image onto me but I play into it without fully realizing it. As I am writing this, this is the first time I have fully confronted this fact. So what now?
All I can do to save face is be more conscious, and change the narrative. Everything is not all good, but everything is not all bad. (Duh!) Today is a safe kind of emptiness, where I am not smiling or forcing myself to laugh if I don’t think something is that funny, but it feels good. I am not being artificial towards myself or others. I am remaining positive while maintaining realism, instead of moping or trying to pretend that everything is [insert one-sided emotion]. I am OK. I am content. For the past few days, I’ve been shockingly happy, and today I am content. It doesn’t feel lesser and I like that. I think I can be ridiculous, but I like myself. This is where I am. Moving up and across and sometimes backwards and sometimes very much downwards and then up, up, up again. ♦

Crossing the bridge between sleeping and waking has become harder. I doze off at the wrong hour, sometimes in the wrong places. I forget what it was like to have a restful sleep, and uniform breathing that leaves you refreshed and calm in the morning.
I’m always tired and upset; tired of everyone, upset about everything. Finals are underway and three professors have assigned us performance pieces as a substitute for the written final exams. This situation is stressful for me because I loathe group work, especially when those in the group are passive-aggressive, careless jerks. There was an instance last week when I tried to lead them into coming up with a decision—a decision that’s better based on group thinking than on a single mind—and to my dismay no one even bothered to answer. Pure silence via a “seen by everyone” Messenger status.
This is when I don’t find introversion a redeeming quality. University work and all the hours required for me to “show up, stand up, speak out” are draining the life out of me, conspicuously. When I get home and immediately sleep without even taking my school uniform off, then that’s it, I’m tired to the bone.
I wonder why the majority of the people I’ve been groupmates with in recent projects are docile and dormant. I think age difference might be a culprit, since my age is that of the usual college graduate. I would have been a senior now had I not dropped out and delayed a year of schooling. At present, I’m carrying sophomore status, even though I’ve taken almost all of the required sophomore courses (university rules are mad confusing), which is also how I happened to be stuck with 16, 17-ish young people at present. So then, maybe age difference is a contributing factor to their passive-aggressiveness (which is so sophomore me, two years ago) and that my being so stressed and un-chill about school projects and group work is because of my being a “senior at soul and heart.” Aren’t the younguns supposed to be full of vitality, while the oldie senior students are devoid of life and even robot-like? If this is the case, then I can’t wait to see what I look and feel like when I become a legit senior. ♦

I don’t mind flying, but that’s probably because I don’t do it often enough. As a child, it was glamorous and exciting because it meant the luxury of vacation. With age, I’ve become accustomed to its more practical purposes, like a trip to see family, and thus, less impressed by recycled air and synchronized seat belt demonstration. However, there is something that always makes me marvel at air travel. 
Generally, I am easygoing person. My fears are superstitious and personal. At a very young age, I realized the “this could happen to you” narrative the news media spurts out in the wake of freak tragedy was designed to harness anxiety and keep up ratings. 
With this reasoning, it wouldn’t make much sense for me to fear an airplane. But there is nothing, and I mean nothing, more terrifying than the ascent of an aircraft. Specifically, any Boeing model whose name starts with a seven. Seated and locked in, with no possibility of escape; it is puzzling, fearful, nail-biting. It seems against the laws of nature that such a beast—filled with passengers, and cargo, and frozen tilapia cutlets in tin foil—could lift off the ground and stay off the ground, for hours at a time. When the second half (my half) of the plane lifts from the ground, my stomach churns in steady motion until houses are nothing but specks under clouded mist, and I’ve been impressed by the airline’s extensive offerings of Spike Jonze films. 
There is a great deal of trust in my abiding to my seat and silence and sanity during take off. I suppose this is true for everyone. The collective conviction of passengers on the plane prevents uprising and meltdowns in the seconds before departure. It keeps the planes operating on schedule. It maintains order in the world. I, along with everyone else, must trust that my plane will lift and fly and land safely, and that science is truth, even when I’ve just written a paper for philosophy concerning the nonexistence of truths.
I trusted an airplane this past weekend on a trip to my cousin’s wedding. We lifted, and flew, and landed safely.* Trust is very powerful. 
*Do note, my luggage was left behind. ♦

I start small. I ask someone for help on a physics problem. “Yeah, of course, I could use a break from my astro homework,” she says, and then, “oh god, do I even remember kinematics?” We work it out together step by step and laugh uproariously at our mistakes. I ask someone else to proofread a short essay before I turn it in online. “Yeah, yeah, sure,” she says, distractedly, and when I turn my computer to face her she scrunches up her nose. “Can it be, like, later? I’m kind of busy.” I am learning who my friends are.
Sometimes, I feel like I learned all the wrong things in high school—pride, secrecy, hypercompetitiveness. A substitute teacher I had in a calculus class once said something along the lines of: “If this doesn’t come easily to you, then I for one don’t want you building my bridges and healing my children.” Asking for help was a show of weakness, a failure of intuition—especially in science and math courses. If you want to spin that a positive way, it taught me independence, right? Problem solving, using different approaches, figuring shit out on my own. But my sense of academic independence is so pronounced that I’ll sit 20 meters from my astronomy professor’s open door and agonize over the homework by myself because I can’t bring myself to admit that I simply don’t understand. At college, it’s even easier to ask for help than it was in high school—in theory. In practice it is just as hard, and maybe harder, because I am still trying to learn how best to stand out.
But it’s funny, because while I’ve always been more comfortable in my “academic skin,” so to speak, I feel a lot better about the balance I’m striking outside of the classroom. I don’t have a lot of friends, but I also don’t care about sitting alone at dinner anymore. I am finding places where I can be vulnerable—I go to a meeting of my college’s queer union and find myself opening up about things I had never before said out loud. Later my friend says she’s proud of me and I tell her thanks, and then I’m like, “So, about this other physics problem…”
I am learning to prioritize. And when my desire to succeed takes priority over my pride, I will find help. ♦

The realization that the week is almost over is less of a relief, more of a mimicry of the way I suddenly wake up fully clothed in the middle of the night, trying to figure out how much time I have to organize myself and trying to collect what I have missed and appear less disoriented. It is never a satisfying end, because it is not one; it is a bump in a cycle, an anti-climax. Every time I fall for it, waiting shakily for the next Thursday to Friday stretch, and the next, and the next. Being a fool-ess is what keeps me alive. Ignorance becomes less about bliss and more about survival. 
Jenny Holzer returns to me when I am writing one of my college essays. IN A DREAM YOU SAW A WAY TO SURVIVE AND YOU WERE FULL OF JOY. Or, more appropriate for my daily life: THE BREAKDOWN COMES WHEN YOU STOP CONTROLLING YOURSELF AND WANT THE RELEASE OF A BLOODBATH. SPIT ON SOMEONE WITH A MOUTHFUL OF MILK IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT HIS PERSONALITY FAST. She is everything to me, and I mean this literally, not some half-formed instance of idolatry; she is the sum of my fears and abuses and primal desires and self-studies. I am constantly astounded that one person can not only mean so much to me but be so much. She is a light in a world where my enemies have good excuses and I am fighting to get out of the crawlspace. 
At a few points in time, I would have said something along the lines of wanting to provide that kind of guidance, practice her brand of encapsulation. But I don’t know if I could handle it, or accept it. My friend told me yesterday that a girl in our school was telling her that she spent the summer reading my diaries and I couldn’t believe her. It wasn’t a lie, but I did not—and do not—have the ability to consume the thought of someone admiring or relating to my work without a barrage of assaults on myself following suit. I’m being silly, but at least I know that I am. 
Is self-awareness really everything? Everyone I’ve talked to about it seems to think so. I don’t think I need to rank it, only acknowledge its extreme importance—if I try to order it or make claims on its behalf I know that I will look back and have at least one regret. That’s it: minimizing the chance for regret. That’s one of the biggest things to keep in mind, although acting on it is harder than the simple revelation of it. I can’t rank my fears either, but one of the biggest is dramatically being on my death bed in the last scene of my life and thinking about what I could have done. I hate that thought! I’ll do anything to avoid having it. ♦

I’m so excited. I have to shoot a scene that resembles earlier films made by the Lumière brothers for my history class. It’s nothing fancy. The shot will be 30 seconds and I’ll only be shooting from one angle, but I’m just happy I get to create a film in general. My old advisor swore up and down that I wouldn’t like being a film and screen studies major, and that I wouldn’t get to do any hands-on work if I transferred schools, but look at me now. Joke’s on him. I’m having trouble finding actors for it, but I’m sure one of my friends will pull through this week.
I keep seeing all these lukewarm reviews of Frank Ocean’s (other) album, Endless. I’m falling in love with it in the same way that I feel like I’m in a hazy, sad but victorious dream when I listen to Blonde. It just took me a little longer to build that same affection with Endless. I wish there was an actual album for it so the video didn’t kill my battery. The song “Alabama” reminds me of tumultuous yet funny moments in my childhood that affect the relationships I have with people today. I feel way less alone and crazy when I listen to both of these projects. If Blonde is a foggy dream surrounding my being, Endless feels like my emotions dripping down my face in the form of sweet honey.
I’ve been praying even though I’m not sure I believe in God. Between police shootings and the bomb that went off not to far from my dorm, I’ve been crying for the past two weeks. I worry about my family. I worry about myself. I worry about my friend who slightly resembles the suspect that appeared on my phone through one of those tri-state area alerts. I texted him reminding him to be aware of his surroundings and to be safe. It almost sent me back to being the person I was when I was 13. I promised myself and others that I wouldn’t open up that chapter of my life again. So I pray. 
Anxiety quietly sneaks into bed with me in middle of the night to harass me in the morning. These aren’t things I can talk about with a therapist. My worst nightmares can’t be washed down and silenced with prescription drugs. I don’t put sugar in my tea anymore unless it’s black, is that a sign of true adulthood? I apologized to past lovers for not being open enough or “shut off.” I was just trying to protect them. I still struggle with not seeing myself as anything more than a problem, but I’ve gotten much better at it. I do think I’m worthy of respect and love from friends, and I accept compliments with a smile. Now I’m listening to Endless again, crying to “Rushes To,” and I don’t know how I’m going to feel tomorrow or next week but I do hope I find some middle ground in all of this. ♦

I am rearranging and smoothing over all my parts like a glass shard puzzle done by bare hands. Admittedly, I am at a loss. I’ve stopped sleeping for more than two hours a day and when I do, I have the most vivid, telling dreams that evade my grasp within moments of awakening. I am used to this kind of running away from me. 
It’s so strange to be rising and falling all at once. 
7/14/16: I miss turning and having you kiss me and I miss interesting you and being the good brand of sick and not feeling like a marble that gets pulled by chance from the sack.
My new favorite types are Genie the feral child, June and Jennifer and their cryptophasia, all the girls I’ve known who were put to waste in their rooms because they told the truth and became Too Much. None of them are new to me—just cycling back around. There’s an extra seat for me in the back, they say. I don’t tell anyone where I am going. 
7/29/16: The worst I’ve ever felt was when you merged with the heart beating behind my ears I hate that you come with my blood and that you’ve eaten all my platelets so that I drop recovery.
I listen to “Aneurysm” and try to remember the last person who made this song feel like something. I count in years. Nothing about this realization is good. In our ongoing, unspoken chess game I am constantly wondering where I stand on the board. I doubt I have ever removed myself from the pawn position. I shake the thought and pretend not to hide quaking legs beneath a semblance of order and OK-ness. I can keep going. One foot forward. I can be better. Try not to trip.

I live in the house that Jack built without a deed of my own. I write to avoid the monotony of going from corner to corner and realize how much more misery I have left to give. I nurse it. I give it a home birth. I raise it in the darkened rooms where we forget windows. I feed it three meals a day. I release it. ♦

I leave on good terms. Both my in-store manager and the guys who run the entire local chain are trying to get me to stay. “Are you sure you don’t want to come in next weekend?” they say, not even half jokingly, and: “Well, if you ever need a little extra cash, you know you can give us a call.” Sure, I’ve got their phone numbers saved, but something in me doubts I’ll be using them. I only have about three weeks left at home, anyway.
Speaking of, I got my dormitory assignment! (In the middle of writing this.) The Facebook friend request is en route to my future roommate, the awkward introductions soon to come. Who will bring the mini fridge? (Are you gonna have a problem with all these plants on our windowsill?) It’s exciting, but it makes me nervous. That’s a real live person I’m going to have to coexist with for at least half a year, and all I have to go on right now is Facebook likes (and I have two, so it’s not like I’m any less of a mystery to her). It just seems so sudden, that this is really truly happening, and I am growing up. I got excited about the detergent pods that my parents bought me the other day.
There’s so much I need to do but my head is too much of a jumble to prioritize right now. I’m thinking about what books I want to take with me and the cute girl that came through my line at work today whom I’ll never see again and the last paycheck that’ll arrive in my bank account sometime tomorrow morning, sealing the deal, telling me that my summer is almost over and there’s a whole new kind of hard work ahead. 
Sometimes that work can wait. Tomorrow I’ll go for a run and make a playlist and eat a real breakfast for the first time in weeks, and then, maybe, I’ll start step one.
But it’s real now. It didn’t feel like it was before. ♦

Very soon, life is going to become about thinking on my own and doing on my own rather than learning about what others have thought and done. I’ve been very insecure as of late, not so much about the doing, as I am about the thinking. I don’t think my thoughts are very profound or important. I am a self-declared simpleton. 
When I was very young, I saw an interview with Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend. The interviewer asked him a question along the lines of, “What is the worst music in the world?”, to which he responded (and I’m paraphrasing a lot here) “I don’t know if there is any “worst” music. As long as someone appreciates it, I think it has value.” So, from there, I formed most all the opinions I have about art. As long as someone appreciates it, and it serves some purpose for someone, then it can’t really be “bad” or “good.” 
The thing is, being critical tricks people into thinking you’re interesting. And that’s exactly what I need to do. Because if people think I’m interesting, they will think my thoughts are profound and important.
For a long time, I was content with my supposed opinionated-ness. But really, the only strong opinions I had and continue to have concern my hatred for celebrities, motivated purely by emotional instinct. I mean, it’s not truly critical to hate Jennifer Lawrence because she reminds you of an annoying girl from sleepaway camp. 
One day, I will have strong opinions about culturally important things. I will distinguish artistic value from entertainment quality. I will be able to tell the difference between good and great choreography. I will go to art museums and and not just perform a 45-second gaze because everyone else is. I will read lengthy literature with no plot and be able to discern themes and motifs. I will “get” Shia LaBeouf. 
My thoughts will be profound and important. ♦

I am scared. This is a time in my life when I’m cementing my interests, refining my passion, and developing particular interests. It feels like being on the edge of a cliff with the subconscious knowledge that you’re about to be pushed; a voluntary burning of the self, the flesh and the mind, in order to emerge rigid, fortified, as a sword is to the flame and the blows of the craftsman’s hammer.
I keep re-reading Virginia Woolf’s The Waves, trying once again to imbibe meaning from words by saying them aloud, rolling them with my tongue; as if to entrench in my heart what little nuggets of light and wisdom I can find; as if to let the book and the words know that I cherish them, as I do my life pals, my intellect, my body.
Maybe not my body.
My body is limiting me from walking the paths I long to take—studying, the practice of discipline, care, kindness, and warmth. I got sick for a week and a half, triggered by a throbbing, dull but constant, pain in my upper back. I am afraid to go through sickness and the worst, because I don’t have a health insurance (who has health insurance in this country?), or any kind of insurance, really. The idea of health insurance sounds strange when you have none, or when you don’t even have an inkling as to how it is processed, how it works. To me, it appeals as this hyper-awareness of an impending sickness, an inchoate presentiment about one’s health or future, which drives everyone, fervently, to apply, or seek, or secure it.
These days I’m always shuffling my feet to keep up with my classes, to heed the calling of my mind to know more and be relentless in conduct. Sometimes my body permits me, and I love it; other times it limits me, cuts me short, robs me of the glory of reaching the goal, the finish line, and so I resent it. I look up at people, after reading a book or writing, and they look like hyperreal, plastic versions of themselves—I’m scared again but I keep quiet, because I know this is my mind in action. This OK-ness with people is strange, knowing that it doesn’t translate to how I see and treat my body, so the goal is this: To be aware, even hyperly so, and transform this knowledge into acceptance. To know and be OK with my corporeality, even more so when it seems to limit me. ♦

One of my friends has been incessantly complaining to me about her mom. Unsurprisingly, it has been making me upset. It’s one thing if someone is telling me that their mom is abusive or negligent toward them, but she whines about how much she hates when her mom tells her what to do or annoys her, as if that’s not something all parents do. One of the main reasons people have kids is to annoy us into being responsible! But, more than that, at this point it’s extremely insensitive and rude of her to talk down on her mom to me when she knows my mother is dead. She’s obviously not considering how I might feel about hearing someone berate their mother for doing regular mom stuff. It makes me feel alienated and depressed. Not only do I feel inadequate because I cannot relate to this universal experience of being irritated by my mom, but it heightens those feelings of “wow my mom’s really dead, this sucks.” When she starts moaning about the person who birthed her, I have to fight the urge to say, “Wow, I wish my mom told me what to do. I wish she annoyed me like yours does you.” I know many would say these are selfish thoughts and that I’m making it about me, but I’m not a bad person for not wanting to hear people whine about petty issues with their living, breathing, healthy mothers. I want emotional boundaries. 
I mean, really, we have all these other friends who have moms whom she could talk to, but of all those options she still chooses my motherless self to be her confidante! As a (supposedly) good friend she should know better than to talk to me about how much she hates her mom. It’s gotten so bad that whenever she brings it up I begin to feel a headache coming on and I have to fight the urge to tell her I don’t care about her mom issues and I’m not the friend for this topic. Everyone has been treating me like their mom lately, but I don’t even have a mom and that’s what makes it so unfair. 
The other night, I had a friend over. I told her about my issues with listening and she said it’s nice that I’m a good listener but I shouldn’t have to be the good listener. I loved her take and felt less guilty about not wanting to listen to everyone’s problems. She understands that friendship isn’t just about being dependent on each other for emotional help, but also just hanging out. Simply being in a good friend’s space can help clear whatever foggy dreariness is lingering in your mind. We ate mangoes and laughed for the rest of the night.
The night after that, around midnight, my best friend Leah invited me over to do crafts. We stayed up until about 5:30 AM just making art and occasionally talking. She painted while I made a collage, which I discovered I really enjoy doing! I was satisfied with the piece I made and happy that I just got to chill and make art that I can hang in my dorm room. We’ve both been going through some heavy emotional woes, so a long night of quiet art-ing was needed. 
Other than that, I’ve had Destiny’s Child on replay all week, because who can be sad while listening those angels harmonize? I’m going to buy more supplies for collages—it’s going to be my new hobby (although I’ll probably end up with too many and have nowhere to hang them). I think my next one will be social justice oriented. I’m gonna include a picture of Angela Davis and another black woman, then add quotes and other pictures. I plan to incorporate lots of gold glitter, too. I want to have a big encouraging poster to look at when I come home from protests and actions, to calm myself down and remind myself why do what I do. ♦

Last week was slightly hazy. It’s getting to the stage where I don’t know what day it is and I wake up at 12 PM every day. It’s like time goes on forever and it will never end. However, I’m certainly not complaining. I love watching Malcolm in the Middle and making pasta for lunch. If someone asked me, “What would you do every day, for the rest of your life?” this is what I would choose. 
I think I’ve finally passed the stage of staying in my room; it was isolating and overall, unhealthy for my body and mind. Hiding will never create a solution, only more negative energy. Instead of staying in my room, I apologized to my sister. We were talking again, until we got into another argument last night. 
I don’t want to speak anymore. I just want to be silent and to stop shouting and arguing. I honestly think not talking will help me immensely. I’m not a hateful person, but I don’t realize how much I hurt people. My sister is my sister. She’s my blood, my heart, and my soul. And I hurt her. 
I’m sick of having to look at myself in the mirror and I’m sick of being me. ♦

I leave the house just before 6 AM. This time it is by choice. I run with my body loose except for one hand, tightly wrapped around my phone; but for once I’m not tracking distance, or time, or heart rate, or anything that quantifies the activity and forces it into a guise of productivity. I just run. It’s slow and it’s not productive. My ankle hurts at first, but the pain dies away as I ease my body into the run, like I would into a hot bath. The morning is cool but humid. Sweat runs down the line of my back. I stop, sometimes, to take pictures of the sun rising through the trees or raccoons caught guilty and out of place in the daylight. I slow to a walk and talk into my phone’s camera for five or six minutes. I tell it stories about the playgrounds I pass and the old house I used to live in and the kid I liked down the street. Then I start running again. I am on the home stretch, and I sprint, and it feels good.
I go ziplining on a course I’ve done before with my cousins. The lines seem simultaneously shorter and slower than they used to be, the height no longer stunning me as I pass over copses and gullies and fields of stubby grass.
My roommate texts me! She’s from a place where there are mountains and forests and clear blue skies, so I send her a photo of the cornfields just outside of town, as flat as flat can be, morning haze blending sky to tassels at the horizon line. The only forests we have are wind farms, I tell her. It’s a good thing we aren’t going to school where I live.
I put on music as loud as it will go and clean my room from top to bottom. That means emptying my closet and pulling dust bunnies of all sizes out from under my bed. My college life begins to take a material shape in the crates littering my room, some empty, some already filled with clothes and items that will be essential once I get there. It’s hard to remember sometimes that I’m not just going off to summer camp, that I’ll actually be living in some tiny box of a room, that anything I might need had better go on the shopping list before I leave. In less than three weeks. But then, I got really excited about my new laundry detergent just the other day. Is adulthood really that far off? ♦

Recently, I’ve gotten into some arguments that have a lot to do with opinions. I’ve learned that I really hate when people disagree with my opinions, especially when I feel like my opinion is more morally “correct.” But I’ve also really learned that the reason people say things and believe in things is totally personal to them, and just because they don’t agree with my opinion doesn’t mean they don’t agree with ME. I get really hostile when people challenge me, and I know I feel like that because the way I grew up makes me feel like I have to have my guard up at all times. Sometimes, maybe the people I’m arguing with have personal backgrounds that make them say what they say. My point is that I can’t really change how other people feel. I’ve spent a lot of time being angry and arguing and I’m just tired of feeling that way. There’s always a part of me that feels like challenging other people, but if I was more sympathetic I could be a lot happier. All I have to do is put myself in their shoes; it’s so much easier to understand people when you truly think about what they’re going through. I truly just want to understand people, so figuring this out was really important to me. ♦

I was out with friends when my father violently sped past me, a flatbed filled with suspicious materials following his vehicle. Little did I know, he was setting up the ramshackle enclosure in which I would spend the next few nights.
Aimlessly walking around town, now alone, he cornered me in an empty parking lot, and threw me, tied, in his car. There I was: kidnapped. He introduced me to a ragtag group of accomplices he’d met at a trailer park. In exchange for money, they’d agreed to aid him in his efforts, amongst them, present-day David Spade.
I was threatened with various weapons and told to keep quiet. I did.
In this universe, my parents were no longer married, so I was relieved upon sight of my mother, believing she was there to save me. I was wrong. She had reconciled with my father, in what she promptly explained was their joint effort to stage my disappearance. In what I then deemed a careless misstep, she revealed to me their plan. First, they would condition me to my new standard of living, an empty shed in an overgrown lot. They would soon report me missing, launch a large-scale search, kill me, dump the body, all while collecting $$$$ympathy from the community, life insurance company, and legal settlements. She explained that since I was so special, brilliant, memorable, impactful, and universally loved, she and my father would make at least $1 billion if everything worked out correctly.
I knew I had to expose their lies. And I knew there was a way.
Phase one had only just begun, so I was still allowed to go to school, albeit without my phone, and under a low profile. My mother, a teacher at my high school, was to keep careful watch, ensuring my compliance.
At school I was my usual self; happy and outgoing and loud and not understanding that I might not actually be the smartest one in the classroom. But some of this was purposeful, I thought to myself, the bolder I am now, the better they will be at finding me. But what if they don’t find me? That thought lingered too.
Finally, I had my chance at freedom: In the auditorium—seated next to Christine, equal parts unemotional and intelligent—for a school-wide assembly. I aggressively whisper-explained my predicament and begged her to go to the precinct after school, to which she responded with a passive, “Okaayyyyy.” In this moment, my mother made eye contact with me, and in the scariest 15 seconds of my life, swiftly approached us. She instructed me to get up and let her sit between us, saying it was disrespectful to talk during the assembly. As I sat there, wondering if I’d just ended my own life, two police officers came on to the stage, calling out my mother’s name, proclaiming they had a warrant for her arrest. My mother jolted up and away, quick to defend her honor to the crowd. But I boldly stood, verifying their claims, sobbing relief, knowing my horrors were over.
But the audience remained chillingly still, unresponsive to my emotion. And then my father, followed by his band of misfits, began to emerge from backstage, hand hugging and smiling at the officers. And the audience wailed, laughter filling every open space, while fingers and open mouths taunted me.
“GOTCHA!” My mother exclaimed as she began a speech explaining her past transgressions as part of a town-wide effort to test and destroy my inflated ego. Really, how could I have thought I was worth $1 billion?
I screamed back at her, shedding tears as salty as I and cursing everyone around me, even Christine, my once-savior. To this my mother retorted, “Watch your language, there are assistant principals here!,” erupting the audience in a second wave of hysterical chortling.
I woke up abruptly, startled and uneasy.
Upon further reflection, I decided to document the dream and share it, because my special, brilliant, memorable, universally loved brain had crafted such a metaphorically truthful statement and it needed to be heard. ♦

1. When I saw the back tire of the car roll over my left ankle all I could see was the dark of the car’s underneath and the maroon of a fading limb and when the sun hit me again I held a stranger’s hand and told them that my body hadn’t been equipped to handle this kind of pain.
a. Put here for destructive testing but I think the lever got pulled up too fast too fast!!
2. I want to eat the swollen parts of me in the ambulance
when every misdiagnosis
is a separate spectrum of pain.
And the nicer EMT asks me if Spanish prayer is OK and I smile, because the words I don’t understand remind me of my abuela even though I wince at the fresh mental image of her dropping my hand when I reached for it as I crumple in the bike lane. 
3. I am in the hollow of my memories of my mother in the hospital STOP
I am alone in the ER with each of her sick doppelgangers sprinting through my mind I count the gauze to calm them down STOP
I curl up with no blankets like a dead man’s curve STOP
My hands won’t write and I wonder if I would trade their insides for my foot STOP.
4. Every time a new nurse asks when my mother is getting here I stare at the fresh lumps of skin sitting in a pile at the edge of the bed and scream:
b. a) SHE’S DEAD! b) She isn’t home right now, can I take a message?
5. They all love a good tragedy. ♦

After getting some form of closure at our final company dinner, I have not set off in search of work. I’m in this weird in-between space. I have some really great experience under my belt, but I’m still mostly relegated to internship work or freelancing. 
At the dinner, everyone went around the table and talked about their next steps. All of it had me in awe, and I realized that the experience I gained the four months on that job really inspired me to hit the ground running. Except now I’ve hit a wall. 
Most internships are unpaid. I was so close to biting the bullet on one, in hopes that the connections gained would pay off instead. That’s not even an option anymore, because I have to come with a minimum of $1,000, a balance financial aid won’t cover. It’s not a lot of money to some, but it’s a lot of money I just don’t have. I don’t want my parents to have to bear the burden of paying, mostly because I don’t want to have anyone to answer to. So, with that, I’m going to have to find a job. Which is proving to be a lot more difficult than I’d imagined. 
I’m just stressed out and annoyed. I don’t want to go down this road again. I went through the application process only to be flat out ignored and it’s beyond frustrating. Not to mention that companies that make BANK are the ones refusing to pay interns. This too shall pass, but this has been such a tough year for me. Can a bitch catch a break? Damn. ♦

When I slip, it is hard and sudden. It is a revolving door into the memory bank and I am a donor in desperate need of transfusions in quick succession. I look up and I see my mother’s face shining in full smile regalia. Feels like morphine turned chemo. 
FROM THE FLOOR: I can see it all. There is no end anymore. I wonder if there ever was. 
FROM THE TOP: Death is like being on the ceiling of the Sistine. I’d rather be a screw-up than a voyeur. 
FROM THE INSIDE: Comfort comes for moments but I want seconds. Being an only child has made me greedy. Being the only survivor has left me starved. Old pictures don’t feel real. I wonder what plane they belong on now. I try to join them and I look like a fool-ess struck by nostalgia. 
FROM HERE: What am I doing??? ♦

The time in between asking a question and getting the answer is where I am my weakest. My mind will not allow me to think about anything but the answer I might get for more than 10 seconds. The longer the time in between, the more of a mess I become. It’s a huge problem and I need to learn how to deal with it. I’ve been saying that about a lot of things in my life. “I’ll figure out how to deal with it soon.” I’ll get to it, I promise.
From elementary school to eighth grade I’d never stayed at a school for more than two years before moving. It didn’t matter to me; I’d settle down and get to go to the same high school for all four years and that’s all I cared about. Finding out that there’s a chance that that might not happen shook me to my core. A semi-recent move has taken me out of the school I’ve been at for three year’s school district. This means I’ll have to get a permit from the school district I’m in now saying that I’m allowed to stay at the school I’ve been going to, and then my current school has to accept me as a student all over again. 
Senior year is so important to me. High school hasn’t been the best for me, but the last day of junior year ended on a good note. I’m eager to get back and to have memorable senior year with my friends. I’m excited to go to our big game against our rival school. I’m looking forward to prom, and crying with everyone on the last day. Right now, all I can think about is how upset I’m going to be if that’s not going to happen, but I’m trying to remind myself how good that yes is going to feel when I get it. ♦

I am used to using a lot of punctuation—exclamation points, question marks, and commas. However, I am now very hesitant to use any of them. I am scared because putting a period at the end of my sentence means saying goodbye and not communicating with you again.
This diary entry will be my last one, and therefore, I have decided to say everything without hesitation, fear, or embarrassment. Life might not give me another chance to share everything that I want to say.
You all know my story. I have been sharing it with you since I was that innocent little child filled with happiness, whose life was turned upside down by the brutal Syrian crisis. It took away everything that I loved, including my father. When he was killed, I moved from the safe and beautiful world where I had been living, to a scary and painful one. My name, Marah [Joy], did not fit my new world anymore.
My city was bombed and subjected to the Syrian regime’s massacres, starvation blockades, and missiles. I witnessed destruction and blood. I witnessed children dying, and young men being destroyed by war. I was shocked and silent in the beginning, but I reached a point where I could no longer contain my anger, and that’s when I rejected and rebelled against my new reality.
The only person I was able to actually rebel against was my mother. However, she was wise and patient, and she did all she could to contain my anger. She consulted with one of the support organizations, and they suggested that I write down my feelings to express my anger, sense of rejection, and frustration through words. They also found a media source that agreed to publish those entries, and this is how I began communicating with you.
The number of people who read my entries empowered me, encouraged me to write more, and inspired me to share the suffering that we were all living through. My city was besieged by the Syrian regime, and then ruled from within by a group of oppressive and corrupt people. It was impossible to pursue my studies there, so I left and headed to Damascus by myself, despite the risks. In Damascus, I managed to pass my high school exams and enroll in college. I entered into a field that I had never imagined before: manufacturing and installing prosthetic limbs. My choice was inspired by the devastating cases of people who lost limbs in my city because of the war.
After seven months in Damascus alone, my family finally joined me. Our life in Damascus was not any easier than it had been in our hometown, Ghouta. I had to take on new responsibilities to help my mother, who was overwhelmed by many different pressures. Since my father had died in Ghouta, a city that rebelled against the government, the regime and its allies saw us as the family of a criminal. What’s more, my mother was struggling to provide for us in the expensive city of Damascus.
Later, I decided to leave Syria for Switzerland. Although my mother did not want to leave Syria, she finally decided that she and my siblings should join me, because she did not want me to be alone. The hardest part of our journey was when we crossed the Mediterranean to Greece on a little boat. We knew that the boat was not safe, but we had no other choice. The fact that we ended up safely reaching Greece felt like a true miracle. I spent my first night in Greece in the wilderness and the cold, but I knew that I must continue.
In each country I passed through on my journey to Switzerland, I was humiliated in one way or another—I was treated like a hungry animal, or germ that spreads diseases. In Germany, I had the worst experience—one that separated me from my family. When I finally arrived in Switzerland, I met with Karam, who is now my husband, face-to-face for the first time. I had gotten to know him while I was still in Syria though our online communication. I was very tired physically, emotionally, and mentally, and therefore I decided to marry him. I needed to finally rest and settle, and marriage felt like a safe solution.
Despite the difference in our ages, worldviews, and opinions, Karam has given me a lot of love and support. One month after our marriage, I discovered that I was pregnant. I was shocked at the beginning. I did not want this pregnancy to continue because I was scared that with all the suffering I had been through, I would not be able to provide my child with a healthy environment. But the moment I heard the heartbeat of that young being, and the moment I felt it move inside me, everything changed. Now, I cannot wait to meet my baby, and all I dream of is to provide him or her with a great life.
I am focused now on studying German so that I can continue with my studies here in Switzerland. Although I miss Syria very much, my life here is a new beginning, and a new chapter. I want to continue to educate and empower myself, and to one day go back and help my people and my country, which I will never forget.
I have poured all of the feelings that I have had since the death of my father into the entries that I have written here. These diaries helped me survive, and this magazine has supported and empowered me. Writing here has given me the important opportunity to help people understand the reality and the suffering that Syrians are enduring. No matter how small my role, writing here has made me feel that I could do something; that I could uncover some of the Syrian truth, and communicate it to the outside world. I was honest with every word and every letter that I wrote, and I am very grateful to this magazine for helping me and my family throughout our difficult journey.
I am not going to say goodbye, but rather, I will say so long. Who knows, perhaps life will bring us together again through this magazine. So I will not close this entry with a period, but rather with an ellipsis. To be continued…
Sincerely,
Marah, a Syrian woman, and the daughter of a man who was killed in Eastern Ghouta ♦
Marah’s diary is produced in collaboration with Syria Deeply, a digital news outlet covering the Syrian crisis. It has been translated from Arabic.

I’ve watched so many films this week, I think I’ve lost count. One of my favourites of all the ones I watched was The Karate Kid. When I was eight years old, I watched the Jackie Chan remake in the cinema, but I hadn’t watched the original movie until a few days ago. The original has become one of my favourite films. Not only can I relate to the main character Daniel LaRusso (who is relentlessly bullied by a group of violent boys), but the whole film is so memorable and dreamy. I’ve always envied the older members of my family who got to see classic ’80s movies in the cinema, when they first came out. 
Another reason I relate to The Karate Kid is that throughout the film, his only friend is Mr. Miyagi. Being the new kid sadly singled him out as a “loser,” so he makes friend with the old Japanese repair guy. I feel like that would happen to me, too, if I was in Daniel LaRusso situation. 
Although binge-watching ’80s martial arts films doesn’t sound like the most fascinating thing a person could do, it’s all I could really ask for. ♦

I don’t know how much longer I can do this.
I am no longer part of my own life. I am a passive rider in every moment, moving from tableau to tableau with nothing but instinct in mind. I am awful at writing my diaries on time. I’ve trashed my poetry. My only company consists of the men of the trenches of my brain I am only tethered to by a kind of Stockholm syndrome, the faint ghost of my mother that does nothing but highlight the absence of being cared for and my own past missteps that I can do nothing but awkwardly pave over—but I still trip over the bumps. My broken bone, the fine line between my flight and the bunker that has morphed into a Labyrinth. Quick mental minutes of moments with the boy I like (liked? Like. It’s hard to tell where I stand in the haze) where I feel nothing but useless, the crumpled housewife in the damp kitchen corner. I don’t respond to messages, even the ones I want to. I went through a few days of extreme energy and working on all of my projects and filling out my Common App but none of those exist in this slow muddle of unreality. 
There is no reason for anyone else to understand the full extent of why I feel this way, especially if our acquaintance has only been through my writing. But I have begun to enter one of the most extreme disconnects of my life and it is a wonder that I did not predict this exact fall at the start of my summer. It always happens. I have no relief. 
I scream, “I don’t want to die! I just want to be happy!” into my empty apartment. I don’t know where my grandmother is. I never do. ♦

My school signed my permit so starting this week, I’ll be a senior. Thinking about it makes my hands start to shake just a little. I couldn’t sleep last night and in between cursing myself for messing up my sleep schedule I wondered who was more nervous, my younger twin sisters who are starting their freshman year, or my friends and I. To be fair my sisters both have classes with friends, each of them have a class with my best friend, and no one will blame them if they do slip up because their freshmen. I, on the other hand, have been here all three years (despite being mistaken for a freshman at registration), and as far as I know, have no classes with any of my friends. 
Nevertheless, I’m intent on having a senior experience to rival the ones in my beloved teen movies. I’m going in with a group of friends who support me and I couldn’t be more excited. My best friend who took a break from regular school for a year to try homeschooling is coming back. If I’d been writing at Rookie around the time she left, know that a couple of these diary entries would have been dedicated to how much I missed her. 
My number one goal for this year is to get the best grades that I can. My second goal is to make the most memories with my sisters and friends before the end of my high school “career.” ♦

It’s amusing that after all of my dissertation-length rants about reconciling the arts and sciences, I find it so difficult to balance other dichotomies: the proven with the chosen, the normal with the paranormal, fact with faith. A physics textbook I flipped through this summer gave me several things to think about. It administered a memory test which I unwittingly—and by pure luck—aced through pattern recognition; it told me that all of the rote memorization I had forced myself through in my high school physics classes was, indeed, for naught; and it stated, quite firmly, that anyone with any kind of spiritual belief would never truly make it as a physicist. I closed the book immediately. I had told myself that I would do self-study this summer, but something kept me from reopening that particular textbook. Because while I am not a religious person myself, I do not take kindly to a point of view that narrow.
Not when my own dreams can be so insignificantly prophetic— 
At 3:58 AM I am jolted out of a REM cycle dream involving an artist whose music video I had recently had on repeat. Is he ever going to get the Olympic gold? I wonder nonsensically to myself, still half lost in the dream, rolling over to paw at my nightstand for my phone. I am prodding stubbornly at the keyboard, recording the imagined events, when the device buzzes in my hand at 4:00 AM precisely with a YouTube notification. That same artist dropping a new music video out of the blue.
—or when a necklace gives me all the answers I want, provided they’re yes-or-no—
It’s a simple pendant on a leather band, a stone with a hole in it and painted shabbily with ogham writing, procured from a tiny side-of-the-road stand in the middle of nowhere (i.e. somewhere on Ireland’s Dingle Peninsula). I suspend it in air with my elbow propped on a table and mutter the opening requests: “Please show me ‘yes.’ Please show me ‘no.’ Please show me ‘unknown.’ Please show me ‘cannot answer.'” I don’t really have any important questions to ask. Will this girl text me back tonight? Will I find out my grade in calc tomorrow? Will I succeed in all that I attempt in life? (Yes. No. Cannot answer. That last one is interesting.) The girl texts me back. I don’t find out my calculus grade until the next week. I don’t know about the last one yet, either, so I can’t really blame the pendulum. Am I affecting the swing? Maybe. Probably. Is it still right every time? Damn right it is.
—or when sometimes I just seem to know things.
Maybe it’s hereditary, because my father and I have this almost-game: whenever we watch a soccer match together, be it in person or on TV, whenever there’s a penalty kick, we call the outcome. “Going in.” “Keeper saves it.” “Wide to the left.” Sure, we get it wrong here and there, or sometimes we disagree, but more often than not we both get this feeling that’s impossible to describe when a goalkeeper is about to make a save. Just today, I was at a women’s game at the university in town—my last before leaving for college myself—and the referee blew his whistle against one of our players. “It’s a penalty!” exclaimed my friend. “They’re going to equalize!” But I wasn’t so worried. If it weren’t for my dad elsewhere in the stands, I would’ve been the only one present completely unsurprised when our freshman keeper dived to her right to bat the ball away from the net and then stood, lifting her fist in triumph, as a defender cleared it safely away.
I maintain that I am not necessarily a religious person—no one in my immediate family is—but I like to think that I believe in something, even if that something is not yet clearly defined.
This is my last entry before leaving home. Maybe I’ll find answers when I get to where I’m going. Maybe I won’t. Maybe none exist and maybe I don’t mind either way. ♦

I am in bed before my 10 AM bedtime trying to salvage the bright lights of a grey recovery month when I remember the best one. My memory has become so bad, paired with the sludge of being inside all of the time, that I couldn’t say when it was—just that it wasn’t this or last week—but it was one of the times he came to visit the bunker. I had just stopped writing in order to draw and he was sleepy. “I’m tired,” he kept saying. Neither of us spoke much for a while because he kept closing his eyes and leaning against the wall. 
“Go to sleep,” I said. I knew what was next.
“No, I don’t trust you.” (No one who is close to me trusts me in their sleep, not that they really should.) 
“Will you go to sleep if I go to sleep?” This became my end of the evening’s back and forth. “Will you go to sleep if I go to sleep?”
Eventually, I resigned myself to the creeping tiredness and lay down. He was next to me when I closed my eyes, far away enough that we weren’t invading each other’s breathing routines. It was the best nap I’ve ever taken because I didn’t know it was happening. I went to sleep with the expectation of going to sleep without really thinking I would go to sleep. Even now I laugh. Waking up was an experience—I didn’t want to open my eyes because I realized that I’d fallen asleep, and was semi-shocked by this. I felt his fingers on mine before I saw them. I don’t remember when he let go but he was still holding on when I opened my eyes. This is my happiest moment of the month. As I write this I remember mentioning it before. (I don’t recall where, but it was in passing.) It is not the same. This is detail. This is me saying: That was the safest I felt in years. Since her. 
Yesterday, again. Still in the dark, pre-recollection. I am offering my tears up to God in a stream of “why.” You know how it goes (or how it must, for a grieving, lonely, bedridden 17-year-old biting back at the heat and the heels of sobriety). Suddenly, rain. Like a response to an emergency call my body is suddenly moving, moving, moving down the hallway and outside in my floor-length sheer nightgown, my crutches banging against the floor at my sides. I bellyflop onto the closed bunker door and look up. Nothing is more beautiful. I think, To have experienced the most precious moment of my life and my mother isn’t even here. This must mean something. The tears stop. The rain stops. I don’t realize everything right away, but to have a true beginning means even more. I know where I stand on the racetrack. (I promise I didn’t recognize the strains of irony in that sentence until it was too late.) 
I wonder how long I will be able to maintain this sort of house arrest, even though I am slowly but surely rising from the ashes of my perceived inadequacy and definite idiocy and lackluster depression. This is the longest diary entry I have written in a while, and a reasonably on time one. That means a lot to me.
Old-to-new creed: This is just the beginning. I have to believe that. ♦

I’m a bundle of nervous energy. Tomorrow, they’re laying my grandfather to rest. It’s been an intense couple of days. Finalizing and going over funeral plans, trying to find an outfit, and generally preparing ourselves for the big day. His death was sudden, expected—he’d fallen ill. However, he’d been in and out of the hospital for months. We’d heard talks of hospice care, but even then, I was expecting to visit him, a conscious him, and chat until he’d gone in his sleep. That’s not what happened. Instead, he went into cardiac arrest, the respirator sustaining him long enough for goodbyes. We live an hour and a half away from the hospital, driving there with the GPS as our guide, trying not to freak out. All we knew was that we should go there that night. I thought he’d make it to see another day. He always made it to see another day. 
The atmosphere was like in the movies, the next of kin in the waiting room area. I was surrounded by cousins, aunts, stepbrother’s nephews, and everyone in between, none of whom I met before. It was weird, getting off the elevators to hugs. Why were they hugging me? I thought I was just coming to visit Papa. I was led closer to the ICU by the family matriarch, who informed us he’d died two minutes earlier. Doctors had been working on him for 30 minutes with no results. I broke down in the hallway, where I was comforted by a supposed great aunt. Hers was a touch unfamiliar to me, so I sought refuge in a quiet hug with my brother. 
Closure meant seeing the body, and I wanted to support my mom if anything. I went in. He looked so peaceful. Sleep. I kept expecting him to wake up and hit us with some witty joke. Grandpa always had a witty joke and response, a mile-wide smile, and deep dimples. I went to touch his hands, although he’d just passed, they were so cold. Very cold. I realized in that moment just how much he looked like my mother, just how much he meant to me, and just how truly unprepared I was to deal with his death. 
So, I found the blue dress. They want us to wear his favorite color, also mine, one of the similarities we shared. I’m hoping my hair comes out decent. I’m also preparing something quick and concise to say. We’re all expected to speak. All the preparation in the world won’t matter—I’m hurting and I’m not sure if I have it in me to say anything. I just know that this has all been a lot. I keep trying to emotionally detach myself from this situation as I approach a new semester, but I’m genuinely sad. I don’t want them to lower my grandfather into his grave. That will mean he’s really done. It’s final, a finality that I’m just not sure I can handle right now. ♦

Despite it being the first week of school we’ve been talking about endings a lot. Every teacher I have has asked all the seniors to raise their hand and then proceeds to tell us how fast this year is going to fly by. When I hear this I take a deep breath and start to panic. 
There are so many expectations that come with senior year. Some you have for yourself, while others are things other people expect from you—my teachers making it a point to count down the days we have until we should start applying for colleges, my family asking if I have my senior panoramic picture outfit planned yet. 
I feel as though I should have done so much already, even though we’ve been back at school for five days. I keep telling myself I’m behind, even though we haven’t really started yet. My allergies season always start during the first week of school, so I’m also dealing with this with a stuffy nose. Maybe I should just try to relax. ♦

Someone told me the only thing I owe anyone is to be myself. I cried. It’s such plain advice, but it was the first time I’d heard it with such unfeigned honesty. I don’t believe a person owes it to me to be who they say they are, because they may not even have a firm grasp on their own sense of self. So I’m taken by surprise, every time, when someone doesn’t afford me the same respect; the space to simply be a person and grow. Like, the audacity. They think they own my spirit and energy. Acting as if I betrayed them whenever they find a new quality in they haven’t seen before. “Oh no, you need to be exactly who I thought you were when we first met,” is what I imagine they’re thinking when this happens. 
I wish the people I’ve had to cut out of my life understood that things happen to people: We can be reshaped by events, and change is inevitable. It has absolutely nothing to do with anyone else. I don’t owe it to anyone to remain in the canon they created for me in their head. Nobody owns me. Nobody has a claim over my personality; it belongs to a much higher being. I don’t know, the universe? God? Maybe I’m starting to have faith in God again, like I did when I was 14.
Something that happened this week:
I hit up Annabelle to come listen to the new Frank Ocean album Blonde with me in the park. We sat by the pond. I connected my phone to the bluetooth speaker, and the experience began. Fifteen minutes in, I thought, Damn, this is some 2016 shit. We’re really in the future. 90 percent of that thought wasn’t even about the album. The part of the park we were sitting is also a hotspot for Pokémon Go. There are always kids and an array of adults running around the pond, bonding with other players as they search for rare Pokémon. 
There we were, listening to what some may call new wave R&B via bluetooth, while moms and dads were helping their children chase after virtual creatures using their cellular devices. I felt like we were in a sci-fi movie that people watched in the ’70s. I felt so present in the future, fully aware that 40 or 60 years ago someone likely pictured a moment like this as the peak of technological advancement. Vibrations ran through my lower arms and fingertips. I expressed this tingly feelings to Annabelle, who is particularly interested in spirituality and being synced in to your surroundings. She smiled, “Yooo that’s awesome.” 
This probably sounds like I was high, but I wasn’t! And I really appreciated the fact that I was able to feel that sense of consciousness without the help of drugs. ♦

The doctors at the hospital taught me how to speak in numbers. Each numeral carried a separate pain and a separate pill. I wondered from my bed if the number 10 would even be able to speak. Sheets of blood came to mind. A 10 could speak for itself, I decided. 
I smell the sickness before I can name it. It stains my sheets, the pillows that I have not slept on in 48 hours, the lining of my clothes. I have an infection and dark marks pop up without warning; I lose feeling in my right pinky. 
School starts on the 9th. I wish someone would come to my house and tell me why every time I get relief, get some sort of understanding and even appreciation of the worst things in my life (see: 95 percent of it), something else drops onto the pile. Actually, let’s not even glamorize it—my mother has been dead for almost two years, my father is in a completely different half of the country, I live with someone who cannot stand me, I had maybe a week of bliss because I am not a person who is allowed to like someone and have it work out because that just isn’t me, that isn’t how my life is allowed to go, I was run over by a car, my one respite—skating—has been ripped away, I had a month of summer before it ended for me, I broke my phone, I lost my glasses, I lie in bed all day with intrusive thoughts and fruit flies, I live in a city full of people whose awfulness you should be glad you cannot and should not be able to fathom and so even if I could go out I would be submerged in what can only be described as an abyss of complete unfeeling and uncaring, and last but surely not least, I now have diabetes. I don’t need another person to tell me what a great tragedy I have for my college essay. 
How can you possibly think not giving up is a good idea when God Themself whispers into your left ear, Drop dead? ♦

There are small elements of my last summer life that are revisiting me in this one: Shunklings and Down 2 Clown, Kids, my frustration over being away from my mother, some of the same people here and there. But for the most part, it is different. We’ve traded Prospect Park for Tompkins, the number of people in our hemisphere has grown so quickly that I’ve barely had time to be shocked by the difference, I’m with someone and it isn’t toxic or painful or fractured. Things are strange. I look for clues in old diaries and new words. I think about the absence of my mother and try not to lose my cool.
I get a headache every night. “Leave me alone,” my abuela says, “I don’t want to hear anything you have to say.” Most days I wake up exactly on time, forgetting to set my alarm clock the night before but my body knows. There are days when I submit to the sweltering heat of my bunker bedroom and pass out until 3 or 4 PM the next day, trying to keep my eyes open in the sweat-stained inkiness of the room. My days are split between three options: See the boy, see my friends and wander around for a little while, or stay at home all day. The last one coughs up a few good things, but mostly, it is the most hellish and energy consuming. Today was one of those days. They carry the most breakage. 
I eat irregularly. I don’t always keep up appearances. I muddle through. ♦

My job is fairly simple. I am a counselor at an adventure day camp run by my middle school English and Spanish teachers, Tim and John. Every day, I get on a bus filled with 50 or so 10- to 15-year-olds, and we drive somewhere to hike, swim, walk, or participate in an activity. As a counselor, it is my job to keep the kids safe and orderly while fostering connections with them. I’m not sure of my ability to carry out the former aspect of my employment, but I am certainly succeeding in the latter. I’ve gained at least 12 Instagram followers since camp started last Monday, and I’m learning an awful lot about the incoming eighth graders.
Aside from the sexual innuendos I’ve heard, and my new acquaintance with the art of dabbing, most notable about my job is the food. Since we travel every day, often to far off places, we have stop for eats. We always try to stop for local favorites or seek after specialties. Bottom line: We eat good and well.
Of all the money I earn this summer, I know about half of it will go to food. No question. But I do frequently question, what food? This is difficult question for anyone, but like the narcissistic, overthinking person I am, I make it all the more challenging.
My predicament is best epitomized by a recent run-in I’d had at the Jersey Shore. We’d taken the kids for a swim at Avon, and driven the bus a few miles up to Asbury Park, which is now equipped with a gentrified boardwalk. This meant my options for overpriced food were nearly unlimited: fish tacos, burgers, fries, acai bowls, smoothies, ice cream, funnel cake, cheese steak, chocolate shake. It was a lot, even just assessing my options. Once I’d seen everything, I could cut options away. I’m almost broke and I’ve become vegetarian, so there goes half the food and all the meat. But still, the quesadillas, the nachos, the salads, the veggie burgers, the grilled cheeses. I wanted something tasty, and filling, but not too much. I wanted something cheap but not cheaply made. It was all too intense. My legs hurt from walking, my head hurt from being in the general vicinity of seventh graders, and my heart ached. Why? Because if I can’t decide what to eat, then how can I decide anything ever?
My indecision is a recent development, conveniently timed of course. How am I, this coming fall, going to decide where I want to be and who I want to be and who I want to be surrounded by and what I want to learn and how I want to learn it? And I know college doesn’t determine your life’s trajectory in the way the College Board explains, but it certainly feels like that now! And what if I make the wrong choice? And aside from college, doesn’t every move I make and step I take have some effect upon my final destination? (Sorry for all the clichés.)
I wish someone could make these decisions for me. And that’s why, on that day, I was thankful I’d packed myself a lunch. Fuck you, free will. ♦

Some firsts and seconds:
Two weeks ago I went to a gig for the first time. I saw the band Tegan and Sara live with my lovely friend Daze, so basically this queer grrrl’s wet dream. It was such a wonderful night, which I’m glad I shared with my sweetest enby friend.
The next day (….or the day after, I forget) was another first, the first time I voted. It was the EU referendum and the question was whether we would remain or leave the European Union. I voted remain, against the majority of the population: We ended up getting the “leave” decision.
I went to my second Pride event. Last year, I went to the regular Pride parade and it was really stressful and upsetting. I had only just come out and the person I went with—who happens to be a gay, white, cis mal—was telling me that I was just going through a phase and my identity wasn’t valid. And then some strangers started calling me “half caste,” something I hadn’t been called since I was in primary school. And to top it all off, the crowds made me lose the people I was with and I had a panic attack and went home alone.
This year was different, not necessarily better. But different. I prepared for it by making a selection of food with my friend who came with me. I also bought a pan flag for me and an ace flag for her. The prep work was much more enjoyable than the actual event. But that probably because I didn’t know anyone there, and and was too awkward and anxious to initiate anything. ♦

You know on when you meet someone new and they ask you to tell them something interesting that’s happened in your life and you totally blank? Well, my usual response of an eye roll and a mumbled “my life isn’t interesting” was challenged in the last few days. I know that my response was never very honest but my family usually tells everyone about my writing before I can, so my token “interesting thing” isn’t usable. 
I stayed over at my friend’s house for a few days, and the entire time I was there we alternated telling each other stories from our elementary and middle school days. She told me about the time she a kindergarten classmate shook her, and how she was the only one who got in trouble when she reciprocated. I told her about the constant bullying that followed me all through middle school. As we told stories, new ones sprung up. We grew closer and now, we could probably explain each other’s entire life if needed. 
This is special to me because I was actually willing to tell my stories to someone face to face. For a long time, I’ve wanted the past to remain in the past and as a result, no one knew my backstory. Remembering all these stories reminded me that I’ve done a lot more than I thought I had. It’s comforting. ♦

My sister and I talked to my mom about our stepdad. The house has been divided for a really long time. It seems that even when I try to be cordial with my stepdad, he acts out. I truly think he hates me. He’s already said things like, “I can’t wait until 2017!!”—as in the year I’m graduating. We laid everything out to her and I made it really clear that he is super homophobic and sexist. He said some extremely disgusting things about the shooting in Orlando and Bill Cosby’s victims. Whenever I watch something on TV and there’s a hint of a character being gay he’s super evil about it, so I just avoid watching TV altogether. And that was one of the hugest issues: My sister and I feel so uncomfortable everywhere else in the house that we just hole ourselves up in our room. Sometimes when I know he’s in the kitchen I won’t go down there to eat even if I’m hungry. 
We said all this to my mom and the conversation was really intense—my mom started crying. I haven’t seen her cry since I was maybe six 6?? It freaked me out. And she said she’s really tired of the situation and that he’s just so shitty when it comes to us and she doesn’t know why he acts that way. She said if she had known he would act like this she would never have brought him into the house. I feel like all of us are trapped. It’s so hard on my mom because she’s caught in the middle. I don’t know how things are gonna work out, because things have been so messed up for so long. ♦

On the train yesterday I saw the coolest woman. She was probably around 60 years old, with short, spiky grey hair, and wearing a yellow and green outfit. Everything was matching, including her green loafers. She was so put together. I wish we knew each other, or that I could see her again. I feel like she probably spends her evenings sipping pink lemonade and reading To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee.
I think I have a love-hate relationship with public transport. On the one hand, it’s quick and easy and you can see a variety of cool people, but on the other, you are pretty much guaranteed never to see those people again. I find it weird that although I use public transport to get home from school every day, and to get to a lot of other places, I always see different people. It’s quite daunting when I think about how many people in the world I’ve seen, and how many people I will never get to see. I also think about all of the boys with curtains whom I’ll never get to see, and it makes me sad. 
Another thing that made my day was when an East Asian man who was crossing the road waved at my family and I in the car. It was so kind; I wish everyone could have the same outlook on life as that guy. I find it funny that the things I saw while traveling to where I was going were more interesting than the actual event I was going to. It was a long day, but I want to thank those cool people I saw for making it bearable. ♦

A couple of months ago I was counting the days until graduation. Now I am counting the days until I am allowed to go back.
Not to the same place, of course—part of the allure lies in this new destination being just that: new. I haven’t received my schedule yet, but I hope it also means being able to pursue subjects I’ve wanted to for years. Mostly it just means an end to what I’m doing now: I’m so tired, all the time, too tired to respond to friends’ texts or study everything I’ve been meaning to or set my alarm early for the morning runs I wanted so badly while I was still in school. I know full well that it’s all in my head, but these things seem nigh on impossible.
I am lost. I am OK. I bite all my nails to the quick and can’t bring myself to spend money, even a few dollars here and there to go out with friends. It’s a vicious circle—the less I spend, the fewer activities I do with them, the closer I am to feeling human again.
And the worst part is that it’s hardly difficult work! By all accounts I have no right to be complaining! Pulling 35 hours a week is hardly a death sentence—but I want to be honest about how I feel. So here I am. Staring down the barrel of an eight to nine hour shift often feels like there is no end in sight. I have to remind myself that, like all days past, eventually it will be over. The day, the month, the summer. There is an end. Sometimes it just seems very far away. ♦

Ramadan ended last week. I’m not Muslim but I’m part of an organization that has a large Muslim membership. We work to bring marginalized communities together to fight for mutual liberation in the U.S. and around the world. Being in this organization has taught me how to practice solidarity in action, and not to be simply an ally, but rather an accomplice.
We pride ourselves on being community-oriented, so in order to become more visible in the city, and bring people together, we held a huge public iftar a few days before Eid. We were all afraid that it would be a failure since, typically, people aren’t interested in political events. Every member was required to help prepare for the event and bring a dish—I brought banana pudding. We were nervous because we had an enormous amount of food and didn’t want it to go to waste if the attendance was abysmal. We were so happy to be wrong: Over 70 people came and made most of our food disappear. We laughed and danced all night while munching on more traditional dishes like maklouba, lamb haneeth, and dates along with tacos, and cannoli in the dessert section. People even devoured my pudding, saying it was the best dessert there.
Members of the organization gave speeches on Islam’s connection to social justice. We were all so proud of what we accomplished and I felt so accepted by a group of people I wasn’t sure even liked me. I know that’s silly, because I’ve been working with them for over a year, but I’m still learning and developing as an activist and they’ve had to be very patient with me. It felt good to be around such love and to be appreciated in that way. That was the energy I was desperately craving after hearing about the executions of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. 
It seemed like every social media platform had the shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling on replay 24/7. Death was everywhere I looked. Although I understand people are trying to spread awareness, seeing those images definitely put my mental health in a precarious state. I’ve resorted to sleeping too much and watching Melissa and Joey reruns. Watching funny sitcoms that are nothing like your actual life definitely makes for great self-care. There was no one physically around me whom I could talk to about the pain I was in. All I craved was a hug and for someone to hold my hand. Then my good friend Razan texted me. At first, we talked about how our summers were going, but then she admitted that her true intention in texting me was to check in on how I was doing given everything going on with police brutality and the media. I began tearing up; she’s not even in the States right now and she still thought to check up on me. That was the hug I was looking for, just in virtual form from my iPhone. She was there for me the same way I’m there for her when terrorist attacks happen and she gets self-conscious about being an Arab Muslim girl. That is what friendship and solidarity are supposed to feel like. 
After that conversation I felt a little better and was ready to go to a protest in Newark. At the first the march was small—we marched through the streets, people gave speeches, and we even stopped traffic a few times with our tiny army. Then one of the leaders suggested that we head back to Penn Station. I was afraid the protest was coming to an end. I could feel people’s spirits beginning to dwindle as we chanted “Black lives matter…” We drew closer to the tunnel in Penn station, where the buses stop to drop people off. 
I was in the middle of the crowd and noticed that people began sounding confused. The chanting became muffled. As we got closer to the tunnel the chant resumed: “Black lives matter!” Then, as we got to the tunnel entrance it got even louder: “Black Lives Matter,” and some people began running. By this point we were in the tunnel, and the chants became much louder. I ran to the front of the protest to see what all the commotion was about: There were about 800 other Black kids on other side of the the tunnel waiting for us with open arms screaming, “BLACK LIVES MATTER!” in unison with us. As soon as the group I was with saw them it was over—both groups began running and skipping toward each other at full speed screaming “BLACK LIVES MATTER! BLACK LIVES MATTER!”, and the echo from the tunnel made it even more pronounced. 
It felt like I was in a movie as I sobbed and dropped my umbrella while running, crashing into to them, hugging them like they were long lost siblings. We didn’t know each other, and we didn’t have to, we knew we were all there for one thing. It was so crowded that the buses couldn’t even get in. I felt so loved. In those moments I finally understand the meaning of Assata Shakur’s words: “We must love each other and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains.” ♦

I am in a house. There are no windows but I can see what outside looks like. There are three doors behind me. I open each one to find a body. They are all me, in different stages, like a metamorphosis with bad stills. I died happy in the first—alive at the very least. My jaw is slung open in a permanent scream and my fists have not unclenched, although the rest of me has. The second is after the shock, in my angle of repose. This one does not speak to me because she has finally been ended. No specter ready for a haunt. I shut her eyes so she may see the rest that has become as foreign as the boy. His scent fills the room and I hold in my bile as I close the door so our suffering doesn’t overlap. 
The third is a sound bite of horror and I close my eyes almost immediately. This is always my reaction to a mirror. Whenever a clear image of myself is revealed I reduce it to a distortion and bring back my mantra: “itcantbeitcantbe.” I don’t wear acceptance well. I poke too many holes.
Everything has come down on me as quickly as my mother’s death notification and I should be used to this kind of lottery pain but I was wrong again. I made a pact with God and the bastard had His fingers crossed the whole time. Another man eating a promise for dinner. ♦

When I was in Syria, I believed that the war was to blame for people’s corrupt behavior. However, when I came to Europe, which I had always imagined as the land of knowledge and freedom, I realized that lies are everywhere. The moment I stepped into Germany I realized that even the government lies. The German authorities forced us to get fingerprinted and told us that that procedure would not affect our immigration status in our final destination, Switzerland. But we arrived in Switzerland, and we realized that what they had told us was not correct, and my family got into serious trouble because we had believed that lie.
My mother has been trying very hard to stay in Switzerland. She has sent numerous letters to the refugee center explaining what has happened to us. However, two days ago, when I accompanied her to the refugee center for an interview, we were shocked to hear from the officer that they had not received any letters from her. It was shocking because she had placed every single letter directly in the mailbox, and none of them had been returned to her. I did not say a word, because I realized that whatever I said would not change anything. I was sure that they were lying about not receiving the letters.
They do not understand what they have done to my family. My siblings no longer have trust in the system, and they now make fun of those who insist on being honest. “Look around you,” my little brother said to my mother, “there is no honesty in this world anymore.” I was shocked when I heard what he said. I pray that he does not abandon honesty and use lies to navigate his life in the future.
Our government in Syria humiliated us and lied to us, and now, the European governments are also lying to us. Where should we Syrians go? We have no place to find shelter.
My situation is different from that of my family because I got married to Karam, who is a legal resident. I am talking about my family here, but, unfortunately, many Syrian refugees have similar stories. These are people who have been through hell to get here, hoping for a better life for themselves and for their children. But until they get legal residency, their lives are miserable, and they cannot even work to provide for their families, which is one of the fundamental actions that makes them feel like they matter as human beings.
There are many laws here, but none of them deals with the needs of these human beings. A refugee may wait for more than a year before finally learning that his or her application was rejected. My siblings have lost six months waiting, only to now learn that they have to go back to Germany. I understand that Germany is a good place to live, but they have family here in Switzerland. Don’t we deserve to finally live together in peace?
Life has been really unfair to us. We are not looking for a life that is void of any troubles. We understand that going through bad experiences helps human beings appreciate the good ones, but for a long time now, all we have gone through are bad times and bad experiences, and this is not fair.
I know what I want. My goal is very clear to me. I want to empower myself through education. Being strong is the only way to achieve what I want, and I am working hard on that. I am more motivated now, because of my little baby. I want to raise him or her on honesty and respect. I will do my best to be a great mother. Oh, baby, I promise you that I will work hard to achieve what I want. It is for me and for you, too. Soon you will be next to me, providing me with the most powerful motivation ever. ♦

So, you know the classic lesbian stereotype and joke…? 
“What does a lesbian bring to the second date?”
“A moving van.”
Well, I’ve finally fallen into the woman-loving-woman stereotype of moving too/very fast. My girlfriend and I, within a week of knowing each other, have done the following: Had our first date, decided to date officially, slept at each other’s houses, had sex (a lot of it), and she has told me she loves me and often brings up going away together. She has also met my parents and my best friend—and my cats.
Up until now my dating history has been tragic to non-existent. I had a boyfriend for two days and an enbyfriend for nine. The only romantic relationship I’ve had for longer than a month was with a girl who didn’t even want to label the relationship “a relationship.”
So, let’s see how this goes. ♦

I am spiritually and emotionally tired. I woke up Friday morning feeling mentally drained. I didn’t know why, especially because I feel like I’m at a good place in my life right now. I thought on it. My friends revere me for being a being great listener, and I genuinely do love being there for those in need. It’s also flattering to know that they trust me and my judgement enough to come to me with their problems and ask for advice. Plus, duh, I care about them and want them to be the happiest they can be. Most of the time I don’t even give advice, the best thing you can do for someone is to just affirm that they’re not wrong for feeling whatever they’re feeling. However, this week, my friends have been coming at me left and right for advice, complaining to me about their problems like a swarm of emotional mosquitos, not even asking me how I’m doing. I’m an empath so I naturally want to help them, and it makes me sad to know that they are hurting. But, that empathy ends up backfiring because I have taken on all of their emotions as though they were my own, and for past the four days I’ve felt as though I’ve been waking up from nightmares that are not mine but theirs. 
Another friend who actually listens told me I need to take a personal day. I tried to do that on Saturday by relaxing at a barbecue and consuming as many ribs as humanly possible, but other homies showed up and used me for my emotional energy there, too. At that point I became ticked off. I started acting distant at the party to see if I could get a break from being the orbiting therapist. That seemed to work but I still felt irritated. 
Pretending to be in a whole other world while at a friendly function doesn’t count as a “me day.” In order to protect my mental health I politely asked my friends to not hit me up for emotional support for a few days unless it’s an emergency. My heart was reluctant to go through with this request but my brain was like, “lol, girl, you need a break.” I plan on taking a day out of this week to get a mani pedi, go to one of my favorite taco shops in town to get empanadas, and read one of the books I took home from the discarded shelf at the library. I think this will help me recharge and maybe find more effective ways to help my friends without using up all of my energy. ♦

My sisters turned 14 this past weekend. The twin terrors are finally old enough to terrorize me in a territory: my school. When school starts up again I’ll be ready for the coveted and eagerly awaited senior year, which will only be slightly tainted by the twins’ entry into freshman year. I can’t pinpoint how I feel about that yet, and would rather put it off until the first day off school.
So back to them turning the big one four. They decided they wanted to go rollerskating, then changed their mind a thousand more times. My dad finally put his foot down with a gentle “I already booked a space at the Rollerskating rink.” 
On the way there we were all so excited. No one spoke about the fact that we’ve never done it before. The only conversation was about how fun it was going to be. Well, reality was there to knock us off our feet. 
My dad was really good at it, but he did have previous experience, and my brother got the hang of it after his first tumble. The birthday girls and I, however, were a completely different story. At least one of us was on the floor every few minutes. We were instructed to try to fall forward if we felt ourselves falling. 
Something I didn’t consider was how close to the wall I was when falling forward. My forehead smacked into it hard, and my tooth cut my lip open. Pretty gruesome but it could have been worse. Anyways, hello from bed rest, and sorry about “ruining” your birthday, sisters ♦

I’m finally on summer break!
I’ve been waiting for so long and now I can finally relax. I feel like the song “Twisted Nerve,” from the Kill Bill soundtrack, is my musical narrative. It’s so beautiful but it’s so short (although I’ve always thought that the greatest things in life never last long). Now that school is over for the summer, I don’t have to worry about getting up early, even though I’m naturally an early bird. The extra time has resulted in me praying again. 
With the constant pressure of hate against Islam in the media nowadays, I guess I was pulled away from God, but I’ve been reunited with Him again. I know that I’ll always believe in God, no matter how weak or strong my connection with Him is at a certain time. The main factor that put me off praying was that during times of dire need I would pray to God, but I didn’t get that special feeling—the feeling of butterflies in your stomach, when your head gets slightly flustered. This feeling occurs when you believe in something so much that nothing else matters. Instead, recently, during times of sadness, I felt as though no one was listening to my prayers.
I just stopped. Instead of talking to God before I fell asleep, I would fantasize scenarios that will never happen, about a life that is truly spectacular and where no one is in pain. I addressed these feelings with my sister last night, and she told me that God is doing this so that I can find little things to appreciate in my life. She told me that when life gets worse, God will give me the strength to remember that I have loads of things to appreciate. Everyone in my immediate family is healthy, I am able to receive a free education, I have access to the internet, I can read books and watch films. 
As she reminded me of this, I suddenly felt so selfish. How could I abandon God, just because I was having a hard time and nothing was changing, when there are millions of families being broken apart due to war and because people need to escape from their countries? After our conversation, I went to bed and thought, Why not try again? I began to talk and I started crying, and then the feeling kicked in. My stomach swirled around and I felt so safe. The last thing I remember seeing before I drifted off to sleep was my ceiling, and feeling guarded by God’s miraculous glow. I know that I’ll always have love in my heart, and I know that this love comes from Him. I feel so strong with Him by my side. ♦

As I type this, I’m receiving text messages from the most consistent friend I’ve probably ever had. Consistent in that she’s there when I need support and is always affirming my visions. be they off the cuff or half-thought-up, she’s standing by to cheer me on. Over the years, other friendships have been demoted to “hey girl!/see ya around!” status. The gang of girls I took up with in college are cool, too. Only one is my real ace, but we haven’t had a tough situation to work through or an exchange of what feels like life-altering secrets to cement a best friendship. We resort to saying things like, “ you’re the closest friend I have here!” or “we have so much in common, it’s wild.” I’m totally OK with that for now. 
I haven’t completely been able to process the feelings I’ve had this week, to do with losing a friend (permanently, I hope) and the reappearance of an old one. I’m increasingly frustrated with people whom I care for holding on to my ankles as I try to soar. It isn’t on purpose. It manifests itself in different ways. For example, that text was a series of memes, followed by “this was you in 9th grade hahaha.” The first in a series of messages that try to pin 14-year-old me down in some way. That was five years ago. I am not that person anymore, and I won’t be able to grow if I have to keep revisiting that person. 
I guess it’s pretty common for people to look backward out of fear of looking forward. I’ve just always had a forward thinking attitude, sometimes to my own detriment—stressing myself out about impending birthdays and goals yet to be reached. I am completely aware that you can be trapped in trying to create your future, or running on a hamster wheel of dreams as opposed to doing anything to achieve them. The idea of being an adult is scary. Many of my former high school friends are on their last years as teens, if not already in their 20s. I’m not trying to be rude, but I have no interest in a class reunion with a group of people who graduated A YEAR AGO. I see them almost every time I make the trip around the corner from my building into the downtown area. A trip to Rite Aid to buy pads is a high school reunion. What for? 
My first petty beef in years was with people trying to cling to whatever status they enjoyed in high school. The Facebook message under the pictures one of the best nights of my life was, “I heard you were talking about me in 10th grade.” How pathetic to come at me, a (formerly) really really good friend. What I remember most vividly was standing on the corner of 129th & Lenox, bawling. Onlookers included my potential bestie and my actual bestie. I cried not because I was afraid, these hands are swift, but rather because whenever I felt like I was on top of the world there was always someone waiting in the wings to steal my joy. I had just seen Solange perform and eaten delicious oxtail, only to open this message and feel put down by FALSE accusations from 10TH GRADE. 
I recently told someone that I was learning how to protect my spirit. I’m constantly surrounded by negativity. I’m taking the first steps in that direction, which includes rethinking the people I share my space with. I value friendship very much, and so there are only a select few people that I’m close to. It’s just that I’m very guarded and private, which comes with it’s own hangups, such as feeling the weight of the world on your shoulders. Oftentimes, it seems like people are ready to release their weight onto me, along with their vitriol. I hit the end of my rope with a friend recently. I just couldn’t take them meeting everything I said or did with a sarcastic quip about how they were incapable. I know false confidence, I know discouragement, and that’s something we each have to tackle on our own. I myself am a work in progress, and when I feel myself hating to be in another person’s presence—smiling less, and unhappy—nah. I have to disengage. ♦

Today a man in the Chambers Street station came up to me and told me that I would be his wife. “I’m 21,” he said after I told him, shaking hands behind my thighs, that I was only in high school. “Not really. I’m 41.” 
Between the bile rising up and the alarms screaming in my head, I remembered my worst fear, a news item from a few months ago on a girl who told a stranger that she wouldn’t marry him on the train and was stabbed in the face by the man. It was happening, it was really happening to me. All at once I was hyperaware of my girlhood and of myself and of the possibility of these being my last moments. He sighed and reached into his pockets with the hand not holding the bottle of a quarter of vodka and all at once the dread chorus in my head tuned out even the rattle of the approaching train. Wait—the approaching train. I jumped to grab everything I had on the ground, keeping my head up and as far from him as possible in case he tried to do something, and hurried backwards toward the train. “Have a nice day,” I yelled. If he was angry it would maybe stop him from coming after me. As if in response, he shook his head and began to stumble toward the train. I ran. 
This has been a week of running for me, of trying to be ahead of everything bad that could happen, of lateness, and enough awful moments to leech off of the good. I have been well, and I have been so sick that I thought I was going to throw up while riding down the street. It’s so strange how quickly things can return to the abyss from which they came, eating up more life than their absence did. I returned from being on an urban farm in North Philadelphia for five days, one of the best experiences I’ve ever had for a whole list of reasons, and immediately the fecal apathy of New York City settled into my gut. My welcome back party was a boy who no longer wants to see me and a park thick with the constant lust for Lethe. But I am learning, and I am moving. There are so many genuine positives that have unexpectedly entered my world, and I am upset that the smallest disturbances are tearing me apart so much that their impact sometimes falls through the cracks. 
My stomach hurts. Running sucks. ♦

1. I lock up and unlock my bike, fingers clicking through the numbers, the sun in a vastly different place in the sky each time. The total number of words I say at work is few: “Hello, what can I do for you?” “What size would you like?” “Your total is…and here’s your change.” It’s repetitive and exhausting. I’m not bad at it—talking to the customers—but some of my coworkers seem to disappear when I’m on shift, vanishing into the back room and leaving me helpless at the front. Food and drink orders blink accusingly at me from my register. In front of me, so do the customers. A few days later, one of my coworkers confronts me. “You were too slow on Monday,” she says. It takes me a moment to remember what even happened on Monday. It’s all one big blur. I don’t say anything beyond a monotone “Thank you for your feedback,” but a little part of me resents it all. She could have helped. She knows I’m not in a position to ask for it. But I am almost done.
2. I leave for college in one month. Almost exactly. My room is not clean and bags not packed and supplies not acquired but dammit, it’s happening! Today I hugged my brother goodbye for what could be the last time until winter break. Every passing day is one less until I am on my own. And I can’t wait for it. I am ready to test my independence. I have learned a lot this summer.
3. But I miss learning. My best friend is teaching herself the Arabic alphabet and she shows me how some of the characters are written, how they’re strung together. “I don’t know many words yet, but I can at least sound them out when I see them written,” she says. She writes the word for “morning” on the page and it comes so naturally to her, or it seems to, I don’t know what kind of hard work she’s putting in behind the scenes, of course, but there is something about her learning that seems to be instinctive. I envy that. I have felt that way myself a few times before but not in a while.
4. I love all of my friends so deeply and I’m doing a terrible job of showing them that. I get home in the evenings and sleep, or read, or lie in bed and stare at the ceiling, notifications on my phone turned off. I don’t blame them when the frequency of their texts diminishes. It’s so simple—just text them back, Lilly, I swear to god!—but even that tiny, attainable level of interaction seems to be nothing if not impossible. You don’t deserve to keep them

I’m working on a screenplay. Well, sort of; it’s more like I have a central plot for a movie, and dialogue and scenes appear in my head while I’m doing daily activities. I write them down in my iPhone notes. I don’t have a beginning or ending, but it’s going somewhere. I never understood people that say one is most creative when they’re in a dark place or dreadfully depressed. Ever since my mood got better I’ve been thinking up so many ideas for different art projects. Maybe because my renewed self-esteem gives me the confidence to feel like I can actually execute these new endeavors. The romanticization of depression has always irked me. Nothing creative or worthwhile comes out of me falling into the stale, dank world in my mind. But maybe it’s just different strategies for different people? 
My self-care day from last week became two days. On Tuesday, I walked around town and got my nails done. The next day, I had a little pizza date with my friend Annabelle. This is probably what really lifted my spirits because even though she’s a newer friend, she’s the only pal who wasn’t talking at me with all her problems. She’s what people would call “chill” but times one hundred. It’s like she’s permanently relaxed and can’t help but spread that state of peace with everyone. Seriously, her vibe is infectious. We talked for so long that we almost forgot to eat our pizzas. When we finished she suggested that walk home slowly; we were in no rush, why not savor the cool night air and being outside in general? As we walked, we came across some swings and ran for them. We talked more about boys and unconventional relationships while we swung as high as the tree branches in front of us. I felt so young and light. All the worries I had about my other friends were quieted. 
Even though it might not be “real,” Annabelle and I both somewhat believe in astrology. We think the position of the moon and stars can be the reason why certain events happen all at once. So it was a surreal moment when we began trekking up a hill toward home and saw the moon smack-center at the top of the hill. It was huge and beautiful, and seemed to get bigger as we walked higher. It looked like it could roll down and touch as at any moment. We childishly ran toward it as if it would somehow belong to us the closer we got. My stress with friends and other issues seemed minuscule. The moon was more pressing than me and my problems. I’m starting to believe there’s something bigger at play, something that makes people act similarly at specific times and in certain places. ♦

I’ve been watching a lot of teen films recently and they’ve made me think a lot about myself. Films like Scream and American Pie, make high school seem so fun. I know school is crappy all over the world, but I feel like I’m missing out on an experience. In England, most schools have a school uniform and it’s really strict and time-consuming. It also doesn’t help that I feel more comfortable in my own clothes, compared to my school uniform, so I can’t help but act shy and uncomfortable in school. 
But I know I shouldn’t dwell too much on these thoughts. Those films were scripted by adults and the characters were played by 20-year-olds. It’s probably just an exaggeration of school. I’m not denying the cliques and the annoying teachers, but, personally, school is never that funny. To be honest, I don’t even know why I’m thinking about school because I’m on my summer break. Ever since I finished school, I’ve been way less anxious and I haven’t had a panic attack in weeks. It’s crazy that when my environment changes, I’m way more calm. 
There’s no doubt that I wish I was invited to parties, or that I knew what it felt like to be “popular,” but at least people in school don’t hate me or pity me. In fact, a few weeks before summer break started, a few popular girls started talking to me. I’m so glad that in a school full of cliques, I’m not labeled. I might be a nobody to everyone else, but I know that I’m just me. ♦

Next Wednesday is the last hoorah. The last expense account dinner and in my own eyes, the end of an era. I remember my first expense account dinner. It was sometime this spring, although still cold out, as I’d worn my puffer coat. All eight of us had Sichuan food, family style. The ongoing gag being that I was too young to purchase drinks and had traveled from college. I was the only person in the group who was still in school and not yet into her 20s. In a weird way, instead of that making me the outsider, it made everyone want to help me somehow. My boss was still young herself, but 10 years older than me. She took a big sister, tough love approach to our relationship that I really appreciated.
The startup was founded by an older white woman, who, to her credit, hired a diverse team. I believe she did this because she knew damn well she needed our youth and access to certain parts of internet culture to cultivate a following. I won’t promote the app here, as I no longer work there, but I’ll just say it wanted to be an amalgam of Instagram and Snapchat. My job title was Editorial Content Creator, and consisted of me working with a graphic designer to combine text and imagery and condense stories into bite-sized chunks. 
One of my favorites this to do was music reviews through slides, like “Summer ’16 Bangers,” and update the list as the summer continued. I really value the experience I got there, but mostly providing the visual component that went with whatever narrative I was building. No matter how trivial it was, I got to be as creative as I wanted to. 
Some of my team members went for more comedy related posts, and we all came from different corners of the internet. We had music writers, comedians, watercolor artists, all of whom wanted to work together as a team. It’s so wild that we were able to create a sense of family over the course of three months, meeting just every other Wednesday. We’d devote our time discussing the inner workings of the Beyhive and figuring out how to better the platform we’d be given. We seemed to care more about the work than the woman who hired us did—she was rich and her hobby was our livelihood. 
It was one of the first major gigs I’d gotten through knowing a guy who knows a guy. The office overlooked midtown Manhattan and had the startup perks that come with the position. It wasn’t on Google or Facebook levels, but the free food was new to me. I was making a lot of money, too—alot for me, at least—which gave me a sense of financial freedom I’ve been chasing ever since. So when the whole editorial staff got laid off, I was devastated. I’d finally started to hit my stride! We were all getting along as a team, and making some really cool things. It was very disappointing. So, next Wednesday, we decided to all meet up for one last on-the-house dinner.
It’s been about a month or so since I’ve seen everyone, but I’m excited nonetheless. I’ll update you all next week about what went down. We’re supposed to be getting some details and closure about our firing. (I’d anticipated things going left, but not so quickly.) Although I’m feeling broke and defeated, I know that I did my best on that job. I’m nothing short of thankful. ♦

Too often I find myself lounging around and scrolling past hundreds of Instagram squares, sleeping, waking up, yawning, and sleeping some more. Now that the warmth of summertime is here, and is actually nearing its end, I’m watching myself slink back into my natural state of rest-unrest. It’s weird, really, when at times I find myself yearning for a boost of endorphins (this is the part where I beg myself to go out and run), and then I’m suddenly hit by this wave-like laziness, which keeps me brooding for days.
It was last week when I initiated a daily running and jogging routine with an old pal from high school, having found my solitary running hours bleak and lonely. It’s also a coincidental plus that said pal just told me that she is trying to get back into shape after, what, a year of snoozing through alarms. Well, as they say, so far so good. We walked a shitload of miles four days ago, and did not stop until our bones felt like the insides of a man suffering from heartburn, until I protested and told her we should rest. The next day I woke up with bones that ached too loudly, which I sort of liked because I can play pretend that I’m hurt as I walk down the street wincing, giving rude men (and men, in general) the worst time of their lives, because, yes, that’s right, women feel pain, SO WHATCHU GONNA DO BUT LOOK AND LOVE ME AT MY WORST, etc. I’m becoming a li’l trickster, maybe, but for me it’s that I’m allowing myself this bit of craziness, this space to expand and thrive.
I’m sitting by the window as I write this with the sun sinking into the horizon, giving off a glow that only the sun can emit. Spectacular. Thirty minutes into writing this, the atmosphere changes, along with the light dimming and the air getting chiller as night approaches. I will be visiting my little old hometown the day after tomorrow. The thought fills me with a tingling excitement and an actual tingling, electric chill down the sides of my legs. The latter is a new sensation I felt three weeks ago, and I’m yet to consult WebMD about it. Anyway, the day after tomorrow, I’ll be on a bus bound to where all the monsters lurk. Wish me luck, my darlings, the luck-est of lucks.
P.S. I’d need books in order to survive the dread of my old hometown so I’m letting you know beforehand, in case my decisions change two days from now, that I’ll be bringing Charles Bukowski, Roland Barthes, and Virginia Woolf (my talisman) with me. ♦

I had my wisdom teeth taken out, so I’m currently living on painkillers and soft food. I’ve never been particularly good at dealing with pain. Sharp pain I can handle, but that’s because it usually subsides quite quickly. But the dull, achy pain of a toothache, or I guess, in this case, a gum ache, is so frustrating and just ouch. My mum has been looking after me. She made me soup on the first day and my dad bought me a bunch of yogurt and custard.
It was really strange when I woke up from the anesthetic: My tongue and bottom lip were numb and my throat ached. The nurses were busy around me and there was a strange moaning noise from the space in front of me. The nurse removed the tube from my arm and I was wheeled to another room where I was given water and yogurt.
I wasn’t too worried about the surgery because I know it’s something that many have gone through, and just before I was put to sleep I thought, If my dad can go through heart surgery then I can have my teeth taken out. ♦

Marriage is a partnership in which privacy almost entirely dissolves. Each partner knows nearly everything about the other, even the things that he or she normally hides from people. Certainly, this does not mean that they lack privacy altogether, but when the man, like Eastern men often do, insists on stripping his wife of her privacy, problems arise between them.
Since I was young, I have always had my own little private things that I kept to myself. Now my husband, Karam, tries to know every little thing that I feel or do. I feel my privacy is continuously violated and it has increasingly led to arguments between the two of us. Many Eastern men believe that they have the right to know everything about their wives. But I am not a naïve wife, and I will not let anybody, even my husband, rule over my desires and my personality. Yes, I do love Karam, but I am a rebel, and I will not let anybody strip me of my rights. I have lost too many of them already to the crisis in Syria, and I will not let that happen again, no matter what.
I have discovered over the last few months that Karam and I do not share the same opinions on many things, and that, in order for us to continue together, we’ll need to work on bridging the gap between us.
These differences are not shocking. My husband and I grew up in very different circumstances and environments, and our challenges as adults have been quite different, as well. Karam grew up in a family that had many issues. His father is a well-educated man, but his mother never cared about education. They were always very different, and Karam’s mother never tried to bridge the gap between her and Karam’s father. This environment impacted on Karam deeply, and he believes that his mother was the reason for his unhappy childhood. What he went through in his childhood still affects him today, even though he is a grown man. When I talk about how much my parents, and especially my mother, sacrificed for us, Karam is surprised that a woman would sacrifice her whole life for the sake of her kids. Sometimes he feels that my family is from a different planet—far removed from the one he knew as a child. He has openly mentioned many times that he would love to build a family similar to mine.
Eastern traditions and convictions have heavily influenced Karam. In Syria, there are still many families in which the man is the absolute leader, where the father bosses his wife and children around as if he were a military commander. But these habits do not fit our times. Women have developed—they do not accept being marginalized anymore, and they work hard to prove themselves. Women in my country are qualified and capable. They are powerful. Women in my country have unprecedented courage.
Arab and Eastern women gained their equal rights long ago, and religions consider them to be equal partners with men when it comes to family issues because they are responsible for raising children and building new generations. Unfortunately, there are always some who, due to poverty and lack of education, do not realize this truth.
In any case, I now find myself needing to play the role of Karam’s therapist, and help him get rid of these outdated ideas. Interestingly enough, while I felt that he was my therapist at the beginning, now I feel that I need to be the therapist in our relationship. I do believe that I can play that role. Why not? Karam is the father of my child and he deserves my hard work to help him.
The only thing that Karam doesn’t even try to discuss with me is my education. He knew from day one that my education was untouchable. My first and only condition in accepting his marriage proposal was that I would not quit my studies. This is why he encourages me to continue – and also because he knows that my education will positively influence our children in the future.
I do not doubt that, despite our differences, Karam and I will make a wonderful family. There is no perfect person, and we each certainly have our own issues. It is very important that we understand these issues and address them together. On my end, I will do whatever it takes to realize my dream and have a happy family. I will do that for the little child who is growing inside me, giving me strength and a greater ability to persevere with every step I take. ♦

Lately I feel like I’ve been seeing the future. My future. I see it in Tom Wolfe’s book The Right Stuff, and in The Right Kind of Crazy by Adam Steltzner (the guy who led the team to put the Curiosity rover on Mars), and in the physics textbook I found online to self study this summer, and in the class listings for special first-year seminars at my future alma mater—including the enchanting title “Extrasolar Planets and Astrobiology.” Sometimes the future is scary. Sometimes it looks like it’s going to be all work and no reward for the rest of my life. Sometimes it’s exciting anyway. In any case, it’s becoming altogether more clear.
It’s a kind of precognition that I know shows only one version of my future. It’s wont to change. Maybe all the people who do a double take when I say I want to go into physics will be right—”Physics?” they always repeat after me, “Really? Are you sure? Well, you know, almost everyone changes their major at least once. I would’ve pegged you for English myself.”
I smile without my teeth. “Yeah, who knows, right?”
But where those people used to foster doubt in me, now they foster defiance. Why are they so surprised? I want to ask. And not only that, but why does it have to be just one or the other? Maybe I like writing and math. Maybe I like learning how to think both ways—”use both sides of my brain,” my mom calls it. Maybe literary analysis and debugging programs aren’t as different as people seem to think they are.
So, to the person who said I would end up as a history major eventually, one way or another: If I leave the physical sciences completely, it’ll almost certainly be for linguistics. To the person who said this one programming problem was so easy, they wrote a solution using just two for loops, Lilly if you can’t do that then it’s just gonna get harder from here: I solved it using only one. To the person who said, all nice and condescending, that my answer to a calculus problem in class was so close, but not quite right, don’t worry, you’re almost there: You were doing it wrong. I checked. ♦

I love the feeling I get after watching Terminator 2: Judgment Day, on a grey day. It makes me feel so calm. 
I’ll be going back to school on Monday, which marks the end of the week off school. I’m definitely looking forward to the summer and listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers and watching Wayne’s World. School is really stressful for me because I daydream so easily and I can’t help being an anxious, stretchy-faced Jim Carrey loving person. If only I had the confidence that Jim Carrey has in the movie The Mask. When he’s Stanley, he’s a plain, nice guy who’s not extremely specific about what he wants. But when he puts on the mask, he becomes superhuman. I aspire to be like him. 
I’ve come to realize how much I love my own company. I only have my own thoughts to listen to, which means that I never misunderstand myself or get into arguments with myself. A recent conversation I’ve been having in my head is about how we, as humans, are born into this world of materialism and how everything is an advertisement, but when you try to break out of these boundaries, people try to pull you back under water. I’m honestly so sick of seeing the same models on Instagram. It’s so annoying that everyone looks the same. And even if the “diverse” look is trying to be achieved, it feels so forced. I never see Turkish Cypriot people in popular media. Maybe I’m not looking hard enough. However, I still wonder why my race is not positively portrayed. Sometimes, I feel as if I don’t even exist. It’s like the music video for the song “Role Model,” by Eminem—he disappears into an abyss while saying, “How can I be white, I don’t even exist.” I don’t feel like I have a clear identity that I can be proud of. 
I’m really lost, my cries for help muffled by the pile of recently bought clothes on top of me. I’m definitely guilty of buying my own acceptance: When I feel uncomfortable, I buy things to make myself feel better. I’m ashamed that I’m not truly comfortable in my own skin. If someone were to take my clothes away from me I would be nobody, and I’m not proud of that. 
I guess my desire to be noticed in this world is quite self-centred. I feel that I should focus more on being happy. The thing I love about happiness is that it can’t truly be defined because everyone has their own definition of happiness. For one person, buying an expensive car makes them happy, but for another, buying a peanut butter milkshake would make them just as happy. I know that I’ll be happy when I can feel comfortable with myself. I know that I want to start this journey of self-love and comfort toward myself in my thoughts and feelings. I’m going to stop invalidating my own thoughts. The things I think about are important. I matter just as much as anyone in this room, in this town, in this country, in this world. ♦

It’s June and school is so close to being over: June 23, I am free.
My peers have taken to wearing flip flops to school. This is both disgusting and sad, but also exciting, because it means we are all well aware of how little time we have left, and thus have stopped caring about adhering to social norms. 
My grades are, for the most part, finalized. They aren’t amazing, but they’re enough and so I will accept them. 
But there’s my chemistry grade. A 70.65 or maybe 70.62, or maybe lower, because I haven’t checked the Skyward app in about a week. A final grade, existing on a threshold, weakened with each passing day. Worksheets due weeks ago pile in my folder, myself unwilling to scratch the answers down. I cannot explain this phenomenon. I’m fearful of having a D as a final grade, yes, very fearful, but I also don’t want to open my backpack on the weekend or after school or anytime really. The work doesn’t get done, and I’m not sure it ever will. And all this, even before I have to contend with the final exam, a cumulative, anxiety-inducing, high-stakes fun fest coming up in about a week. 
I have this plan I devise in my head every night, before I lay to rest. I set an alarm for 6 AM and decide that from 6 AM to 7 AM I will do whatever chemistry work I need to show my teacher. Every morning, I silence or snooze said alarm, oversleep, and show up late to my first period class: chemistry. ♦

A couple of weeks ago, me and my sister listened in while my mom and my stepdad were fighting. I didn’t mind because my stepdad was making an ass of himself and my mom seemed mostly in control. It’s super rare that we see our mom reprimanding my stepdad. He’s always doing something annoying and when we tell her she puts it under wraps, which makes us feel like she respects him more than she does us; she has noooo issue putting us in or place in front of him, yet when he messes up nothing happens. 
Anyway, they were arguing about how my sister and I don’t make him feel welcome in the house. I thought that was ridiculous because ONE, Does he have any idea what it’s like to be two girls and have some strange man move in with you? And TWO, I thought I was doing a good job because I wrote him a letter that was basically a peace offering and we were doing fine. My mom called us downstairs and told us the issue. 
I was already annoyed because I’d only managed a couple hours of sleep the night before (thanks school), and I was ready to go to bed. As a result, I was not super engaged. On top of that, my stepdad was acting so so SO immature, it was unbelievable. The entire time he was cutting my mom off, being sarcastic, and laughing at what she was saying. It was so irritating to witness, when I knew my mom just wanted to diffuse the situation. It was really hard for me to watch him treat my mom that way. Everything down to his body language showed that he didn’t care about anything. He is also starting to act just like my dad who I consider emotionally abusive and recently, physically abusive. 
At this point, I feel like it’s important to mention that I hate starting problems like this. But every time I try to make sure everything is OK, I get pushed and agitated until I react badly. I don’t like getting angry, especially not because of other people. It makes me feel really helpless and out of control. One of the main triggers for that feeling is people not listening to me, especially when I haven’t done anything wrong, I don’t know why.
I started trying to say something, to be the voice of reason. I just wanted to stick up for my mom. But, although I listened to my stepdad when he spoke, whenever I tried to speak he cut me off. It hurt: I truly, truly hate not feeling heard. He kept provoking me, it was like he knew what he was doing. Then, when he saw me getting worked up he handed me his glasses and he’s like, “Go ahead and break them since you’re acting like a psycho.” That immediately set me off. I have issues with mental health that I’M not even ready to address, and here he is explicitly enabling my anger. I don’t think anyone’s ever done that before? I took them and I broke them, and I lashed out and ripped his shirt and broke his phone. 
I’m really disappointed in myself. Why do I always let people have this sort of control over me? I think part of what made this situation escalate was that it reminded me of my dad—I’m still really sore about all that went on with him. I hate how all of this started because he didn’t feel welcome but now I feel like I don’t belong anywhere. I’ve been working really hard so that my mom can change the custody so I don’t have to live at my dad’s anymore, but now that I have this issue with my stepdad everything is feeling a little impossible. I feel like I’m floating between two spaces that were never really mine to begin with. I try to hang out with friends more but anxiety doesn’t help with that. I find myself spending a lot of time alone, which is important and I understand that we all need to be able to be alone, but I think I’ve done a lot of being on my own. Now I feel lonely and it’s no fun at all. 
I have one year left of high school and getting out of here feels so far away. I don’t know if I’m ready to handle everything that’s bound to come this year. ♦

I am doing two things La Loba would scold me for: wearing a knee-length sweater in 86 degree weather and hiding from my problem, in the same room as the problem. There’s a stack of Freud at my feet and it reminds me of freshman year, when I sat here and proclaimed that I wanted to spend all of my time learning. My education didn’t arise from Nietzsche but from ashes and bunker corners and scouring my tongue over the kitchen sink. 
Yesterday: We walked into the graveyard after our time on the hill and I said it was my first. I had only visited the grey slabs in passing trains where my mother bit all my fingertips when I pointed at them. “Don’t you know it’s bad luck?” she said. “Never do that again.” All of the names are Irish or Italian with Eastern Europeans in between. The sky is too flat here and all the angels look the same. 
Mausoleum passing. “Why do some of them have tiny houses?” he asks. I love his questions. “What a waste of space. This is why I don’t want a grave. I don’t want to be a waste of space.” 
“I don’t want a funeral. I don’t even want to be buried. But I also don’t want to be cremated.” I think about how I never thought my mother would lose her body. “Honestly, when I die, they can just throw me in the trash.” I like the way we talk because there is truth in all of our jokes. 
We reach a crossroads. “Which way?” he asks. Eenie-meenie-miney-mo, yes or no—that way. I point and we walk. “It’s another hill,” he says. He skated the last one we were at. 
“I’m gonna do it,” I say, resting my board down. 
“No, I don’t want you to get hurt.” He said this last time, but this road is worse and the cracks are unforgiving. I’ll be fine. It’s a worthy trade-off. I feel him watch me as I go. ♦

I don’t know how to write about this. I don’t know where to begin. Ever since I heard about recent events in Orlando I’ve been shunting aside everything I’ve been feeling, telling myself I’ll deal with my own personal reaction later. Focus on work, focus on friends, Awareness, knowledge of what happened, that’s different. I internalize well; I can separate the emotions from the events. But I have to deal with both sides of the equation eventually. Solve for x, solve for y.
I’ve always wanted to go to Pride. Now, on some level, I am afraid to.
That is difficult to deal with.
My coming out story can probably be summed up as “easy,” at least in hindsight. I only ever directly said the words “I think I like girls” once, to my mom. In fact, I’m sitting here writing this in the very same place where I said that out loud for the first time. My friends all took it well. Nothing really changed. That doesn’t mean I was able to magically put an end to all of my confusion. Did I only like girls? Could I see myself ending up with someone of another gender? How does my own gender play into it all, anyway? These are questions I still haven’t answered. I still struggle to attach any definite labels to myself, although I absolutely support those who do.
But even if my coming out was that “easy,” god, sometimes it seems like just existing as the person I am is hard. I often feel like I try to convince myself that I have it easy in general, and maybe it’s true, that my situation is a good one. I have a roof over my head, and family and friends who love me. That doesn’t mean I’m immune to the fear. Not just for myself—for all LGBTQ people, especially Latinx and black people in Orlando, and Muslims affected by Islamophobia all over the country, and kids still “in the closet” who might see these events on the news and keep their mouths shut.
God, I don’t know how to keep going. To keep writing about this, that is.
I know how to keep going. A friend just texted me asking if I want to make a trip to a pride festival in the nearest big city with them in a couple of weeks. And I am still afraid. But maybe I will say yes. ♦

When Dad took me to his work in downtown San Diego, I had my camera in one hand and my phone in the other for navigation. I have this idea that if you look like you’re on a mission, no one will try to get in your way. No one sane, at least. Well, I guess that’s not too reassuring. 
I am sure the college kids working at Blick Art Materials thought I was stealing. My overalls could be viewed as conspicuous, I suppose. On my final trip there, I bought four small oil pastels. All pink tones. As I did it, I thought about Barnaby Whitfield, my current fav artist.
I carried my oil pastels a mile or two back to the Coffee Bean by Civic Center. For once, I pulled out my sketchbook and tried to be a cool artist and draw some people I saw outside the window. I started down the trail of self-hate, because it all looked like my personal style of crap and it was twenty steps backwards from the art I’d been creating with paint. I suppose I shouldn’t be upset since I don’t use pastel often, but, of course, that wasn’t good enough an excuse for me. 
“That’s really good!” 
The words were similar to what everyone says, but the tone of voice was completely new. It wasn’t a mom trying to pad or some nice art hoe kid. She really thought it was good. OK then. 
I was immediately indebted to her and her genuineness. She was a suit, like 80 percent of the city, but clothes were just clothes on her when she had those eyes and that voice to make people believe her with. 
I thought that was it. The interaction was over and I could cool down. 
But she said it again, and I panicked. I’m sitting here trying to remember the words that bridged that moment to the next—when she asked where I wanted to go to school. Oh yeah, she said that suits are all secretly jealous of artists and really need them to survive. I almost hated her, but then she said something amazing that I haven’t heard before, “Hey, you’re never going to see me again, so just tell me what you really want to do.” 
And I did. 
“Alyson, you just have a very trusting and kind aura. Believe me, I don’t talk to random strangers all the time.” 
I walked down the street and didn’t have enough eye-energy to launch tears. Anyways, I had to find my dad. ♦

This has been a trying week. Not all of the trying has been negative, but there have been plenty of opportunities for me to grow as a person. 
I began the week with an interview at my favorite magazine. I’d spent the couple of days before feeling absolutely terrified. My fear turned into me nitpicking my outfit selection for the day. It even turned physical: I felt queasy and lightheaded most of the way there. To me, it was a stepping stone, but one I didn’t think I would even have a shot at until years down the line. I arrived 30 minutes early. Hoping to waste some time, I popped into a Starbucks close to the building. 
I began to size myself up in the morning, rattling off positive affirmations, hoping to believe in them enough to get me through the moments ahead. I had this image of walking into a bustling office, filled to the brim with gorgeous talented people whom I had long admired, and just not stacking up. I’m a obsessed with media, especially magazines, and other tactile forms. I spent a large part of my early years soaking up New York radio, reading my parents’ issues of Vibe, Source, and XXL magazines. Who took the pictures? Who was the editor in chief? Danyel Smith-era Vibe and coverage of NY rap circa 2011 was instrumental in my desire to become a music journalist. 
I had these excessively high aspirations, most of them tied to what I thought it meant to be a music journalist. Most of them, I now realize, wouldn’t be considered professional anyway, such as getting in with the rapper and their squads because I was “one of the boys” and then capturing them in the moments that haven’t been discussed in interviews. When I had a new favorite artist, I watched and read all their interviews on YouTube, and was often disappointed when journalists would ask them the same questions. “How did your group get its name?” I’d think, Did you bother to research them? 
The lines between the interviewee and the media personality interviewing them are increasingly blurred. Many media personalities spend so much time cultivating their own brands and stardom that it affects their ability to do their job. I love and care about pop culture, especially black American culture. It isn’t a joke to me. To see it treated as such by media companies that built themselves up by covering rap and other black art forms, is disheartening. 
Although, I’ve taken a little break from my obsession with rap and the idea of being a music journalist, I’m still wary of gatekeepers. I watch Hot 97 personalities think that it’s cool to take shots or ask generic questions with younger guests, which I see as blatant disrespect. I just know for a fact that I can do their job one thousand percent better than them. 
We’re in a space now where there is no clear set path to get to where you want to go. Whereas before in the past, you’d go to school for broadcast journalism, and then internship, and then and then. That doesn’t exist anymore! I have a whole list of people and I’m coming for their spots, because I know I can do it! I can do it! I just need to get out of my own head to do so. ♦

I don’t know what to start with this week. I was going to write about being liked back by someone for the first time in over a year, and the first time ever by a boy, and then the Pulse shooting happened and gripped my morning. I was going to write about Pulse and how heavy it made me feel and how it intersected with my recent thoughts on my own sexuality and how strange it’s been being queer while so involved with a boy when another personal crisis blitzkrieged my day, leaving me at a complete loss for breath and blood and everything that reminded me that I was alive. I don’t know what to do with myself. I don’t know how to stop thinking about my own problems without dropping my ego somewhere where it can’t be recovered. 
My grade is on a college trip right now and it is so hard to keep myself upright, to be centered and well and not constantly in the midst of a stomach pain or quieting the pounding for validation in my head. My mom always told me that I made myself sick with my worrying, and it is true. All of my stressors are mammoths in my mind, trampling the calm savannas of “happy places” and the unmoving upstate air. 
The boy and I—we talk about where I will be in a few years. It is the day before I leave. He wonders what I’ll be doing. “So do I,” I say. Unsure footing is my constant. 
“You watching you,” he replies. “Me watching you watching you.” I’m too tired to be happy.
“Just like television.” 
“Better than television,” he says. Of course. I can always figure out our script. Nine times out of 10 it makes me feel better. This time is a rare miss. I still feel confused, stuck on the prospect of not being good enough, of being the domestic bore ignored in daylight and returned to in the comfort of privacy. Being ignored and coming in last does this to me. 
I fear anything owning my heart like this. I don’t know when the loan became permanent but I do know that my existence is now tethered to something greater than itself, something extending beyond another person. It is not just him but the way I feel about him, the strength of the ability to relate this deeply to another person, and the potential for all of that to undo the pieces of my foundation this same connection laid down. None of these are new concerns—only the vulnerability is a changed brand. 
I am in five different knots. He makes me feel like my life is a strip of light with no years to contain or restrain it, and he makes me feel like I am back in the woods waiting for the hatchet to stain my nightgown’s back with the final blow. 
Trusting, or even beginning to trust a man feels like one of the greatest betrayals that I could ever enact upon myself. I am the one who taught myself to be unmoving in the face of evil, the one who has understood the manipulations of beauty that men tirelessly weave and then lay down for the next day’s catch. 
What have I done? 
Where are we going? 
What have I done? ♦

Sometimes when I see my friends interacting with their mothers I get an odd feeling. But never in the years that it had plagued me have I been able to pinpoint exactly what it was. I defer feeling things. Is that common? In the midst of awkward, angry, or otherwise traumatic situations I remain numb. That is, until I can no longer handle not feeling and suddenly feel EVERYTHING. This can happen at the most inconvenient of times, like right before my Spanish final or in the middle of an event that I’d been looking forward too. One second I’m fine and enjoying myself and the next I’m sobbing in front of my entire class. I even wrote this paragraph as a device to procrastinate writing about my actual feelings. See? Over the years I’ve gotten really good at it.
But I think that’s enough procrastinating. A few weeks ago, I was doing my usual review of my day where, right before bed, I think about everything I did that day and decide if there are things I’d like to do again. I remembered a moment when my friends mother had called her out of the blue to tell her that she loved her. The feeling that I’ve come to know spread like a bitter cold through my stomach and I busied myself with playing around on my phone until my friend hung up. As I lay in bed that night, I know I started to feel something, but I told myself that I was too tired and fell asleep. 
This morning I woke up thinking about it. I don’t know why it was suddenly on my mind again but it was and I knew what the feeling was: I was angry. I’m so angry that I don’t get those random calls from my mom, to let me know that she loves me. I’m hurt that I don’t get to talk to her about the things that you’re supposed to talk to your mom about. I’m so ashamed that I’m crying as I write this. I can’t let my siblings know that this still hurts, that I’m still upset about it, because we are supposed to be stronger than our feelings. I’m supposed to lead by example and tears aren’t a sign of strength. 
I wish I didn’t love my mom so much because then it would be easy to not know how she’s doing. I really want to hate her so that I don’t feel bad about avoiding talking to her. But I love her with all my heart, and I miss her. ♦

Thoughts from the void, or things I’ve thought and written down today.
i. OK, what am I writing? I’m trying to distract myself and prevent a panic attack. 
ii. Loud people sitting next to me—a bit awkward. 
ii. Life is so complicated and inconvenient. Some people get to stroll through like it’s nothing, but most of us have to wade through a swamp, maybe climb up a hill. Then there are those who have to defeat Everest. 
iii. Oh no! Straight people are kissing—pardon me, making the fuck out. Not that if a gay couple were making out on public transport I wouldn’t be mildly uncomfortable, but when they’re straight I pretend that we live in a world where straight couples are considered perverse and different. 
iv. Swearing has lost all meaning, the word fuck no longer has the same effect it once did. There was a time when “crap” would get you grounded, now you might as well be calling a bunny cute. ♦

I am literally blaming all of my unruly emotions on being a Sagittarius and it has a surprisingly calming effect on me. 
God, everything hurts. Everything is a battle. Mind and body. The body, uncompromising in what it wants. The mind, a leash. The mind is really no fun. 
When I feel like I can’t eat, which one is that? My body doesn’t want food. It wants him. My mind, maybe, being logical. But that, too, wants to standby in the case of any unforeseen emotional changes. 
I thought I liked the game until I saw what it could do to me. Food is just a piece and I can’t breathe in church. I went mad in Wings and Things. 
I liked the game until I no longer had the upper hand. ♦

Pride is this weekend, and because of what happened in Orlando and the threats of violence at different Pride events around the country, a lot of my friends are starting to feel scared to go. It’s weird because everyone I know looks forward to Pride, and San Francisco Pride is probably one of the biggest celebrations in the country. So it’s really sad that everyone is on the fence this year. It’s more shocking because our city is really accepting of queer people, in my experience. But I guess Orlando could have been really accepting and what happened still happened. It only takes one person to do something like that. 
I’m trying not to be scared and my weird coping mechanism is to remind myself that someone got shot at San Francisco Pride last year and I wasn’t super scared then so I shouldn’t be scared now. But now it’s different as a queer girl: Queer people are being targeted. It makes me so upset that someone could just go and ruin lives and instill fear in an entire community. I’ve been dreaming about Pride since last year! I have so many more friends now, and I’m even gonna be in the parade!!! So I don’t want to be scared, I want to have a really good time. I really hope that happens. ♦

I keep having flashbacks of things that occurred during my time in the hospital, 10 months ago. 
Since I’m still not completely ready to talk about it, I won’t go into complete detail, but 10 months ago I had scoliosis correctional surgery. Scoliosis is the “abnormal” curvature of the spine, which meant that my spine was in a “S”-type shape. I found out I had it when I was 12, in September 2014. The doctors said I’d had it since birth, but it starts to develop more when the person goes through puberty. I can’t explain how different I felt after I came home from the doctor that day. I was so envious of my classmates for having such minuscule problems. 
The time between my diagnosis and my surgery was very rough for me: People at school made fun of me for wearing my back brace, I was always in excruciating pain, and I felt like everyone felt sorry for me. Even some of my family members made me feel weird and didn’t except that I’m still the same girl, just with a health issue. And I say health issue because scoliosis doesn’t just affect someone’s body, it can push into the person’s lungs if the case is severe, like mine was.
In August, I had my surgery and stayed home from school for six weeks (one of the coolest times of my life). But there were things that happened in the hospital that I’m trying to forget. I don’t like remembering the way I couldn’t walk with ease, or how I couldn’t sit up for more than five minutes without getting tired. The worst was having to have an enema, but I won’t go into detail because it’s a bit too disgusting. I’m completely back to normal now, but I guess it’s hard to forget the pain I was in.
Surgery was the best choice I could’ve made, but it had a stronger mental impact than I thought it would. ♦

I wish people would stop projecting their ideas of what I should look like and be when I didn’t ask them. So many people tell me how “bad” my afro shrinkage is and how I should do more twist outs or get braids again. I love shrinkage, it means my hair is healthy. I used to be obsessed with twisting my hair every night to make it look longer when I took it out in the morning, so I’d look more feminine. But I’ve gotten over that now, and that’s something I’m very proud of because I used to loathe my nappy hair. I was so ashamed of the tight puff it would curl into after a shower that if I didn’t do a twist out I made sure to wear a hat so no one could see my undefined curls. So I find it really unsettling when someone tells me I should go back to feeling that way. It’s like asking me to go continually dip myself in boiling water that singes off my skin.
I’ve been getting so much better at accepting myself for who I am and loving my looks and personality. I’ll never be the most graceful or typically attractive. I’m still beautiful anyway, and so what if I don’t abide by patriarchal white supremacist standards of beauty? I even feel better about my scoliosis! Whenever I feel insecure about my body compared to the able bodied images I see every day I just say, “My body is too punk rock for the rest of the world!”
So many people think they know me and my reasoning for doing certain things. I’ve been wearing mostly bodycon dresses for most of the spring and summer simply because they’re more comfortable than shorts. But a few weeks ago, I went to Brooklyn to visit a “friend” and when I got to his place and told him how awkward it was to be cat called and followed down the street on my way there, he argued that the main reason men are doing that to me is because I have a big butt and wearing a tight dress just accentuates it. “You know what you’re doing,” is what he said. Then he proceeded to get mad at me because he admitted that my physique also aroused him and he thought I was silly to be mad at comments about my body while I’m dressed like that. His harsh words made me uneasy, and when I gave him a piece of my mind about his bullshit opinion of me I was suddenly “taking it too personally” and just acting in a disrespectful manner because I’m young, when really he was the one being inappropriate with me. I wasn’t going to put up with that, so I left his place.
It’s really maddening to know that I have no control over my body and how it’s viewed, that I can’t wear something without someone assuming I’m after attention. It’s just like, Why are you concerned about me? It’s my body and I’ll do what I want with it. 
When I was growing up and even now, whenever I express discomfort with something done to me, or defend myself from mean jibes I’m turned into the bitch who should be fine with being stepped all over and ridiculed. I’m expected to be quieter than other people because I’m this tiny black girl who’s just supposed to make sure everyone else around me is happy and not pay any mind to my own comfort. Sometimes there’s nothing more painful than having to apologize for being genuinely upset about being disrespected or abused. It used to makes me so emotional that I’d cry about it at times. But in recent years, it got worse because, as I grew older, I was taught to hold it in. That’s why now it’s so important for me to trust myself, and love myself, because so many people try to trick me out of my emotions or gaslight me, and I still don’t always let my feelings manifest into actual concerns. I get manipulated into thinking I’m overreacting, or that my disgust with the way someone treats me actually makes me the nuisance, and I’m supposed to comfort my abuser. 
Accepting myself has helped me understand that my emotions are as real as can be, and that I have a right to own them and share them when I feel unsafe. I feel so much more like myself again: The girl who’s not afraid to fight back and tell someone off when they’re being a jerk. I’m overjoyed to be finally getting back to that place. A year ago it seemed impossible—I thought I’d never get back to being confident assertive girl I once knew. But here I am now, aware that I am worthy and pretty in my own way. I’m perfectly me. Nappy hair and all. ♦

The parade is bright and beautiful and everything I imagined. Float after float goes by—radio stations blasting music, clothing companies on publicity stunts, LGBTQ+ organizations in full pride attire. Walkers fling strands of beads and wristbands into the crowd, hands going up at lightning speed to pluck them out of the sky. “FREE HUGS,” someone has Sharpied across their collarbones. Behind us people shoulder through the swarm with armfuls of T-shirts and flags and bracelets, shouting to be heard through the din, more focused on selling their wares than the spectacle going by in the road. But they’re as much a part of things as everyone else is. They’re another splotch of rainbow in the whirlwind of color that has taken over the city.
I’m not good around that many people. By the time the parade is over I’m about ready to burst, and we still have hours of elbowing our way through crowds ahead of us. But it’s still good. At the end of the day I’ve walked more than eight miles and drunk what feels like gallons of overpriced water from convenience stores and pop-up stands along the route. I’m sunburned but not sorry for it. The sunset on the two-hour drive home looks like the parade all over again.
What worries me, later, is how easy it is for those colors to fade in my memory. Because now, at home, it feels like I just woke up and the last two days were just some fever dream, swallowed up neat by the immediacy of reality. It feels wrong to complain about going to work, going back to my usual routine, but an interruption like that is hard to deny. Two days of doing more walking than eating and now I can’t stomach breakfast without nausea eating away at my gut. I’m so tired that my contacts sting my eyes and I can hardly focus, barely enough fight in me to figure out what I need to wear today. And maybe these are all just metaphors for depression resurgent, because Pride was beautiful but I didn’t really feel like a part of it, and that didn’t really hit me until after I made it home. I don’t really feel like I’m part of much at all right now. But I’ll get through it. I’ll go to work and smile blandly at customers and then I’ll come home and I’ll be able to sleep again. Right now that’s enough of a reward. ♦

I had a dream the other night that my best friend was parallel parking my car at a party, and while doing so, scraped the car of a very cute boy. (Note: Both my best friend and the very cute boy are real people I interact with on a daily to almost-daily basis.) In the aforementioned dream, I walked out of the party to discover my car stopped in the middle of the street—with a line of paint missing from its right hand side, and a matching absence on the car of the very cute boy. 
My best friend remained in the driver’s seat, too shocked and embarrassed to exit the car. It almost annoyed me she felt this way, because I wasn’t mad at all. The scratches didn’t seem severe, in fact I could barely make them out. But then the boy exited his car, yelling, and cursing, out of character for him, and indicative of a serious offense. And suddenly a streetlight became brighter, revealing deep dents in both cars, ruined doors, thousands of dollars worth of damage. I apologized to the boy profusely, but the only condolence that came to mind was “I’m sorry for who did this.” In my head, I needed to keep reminding him of that: my car, but not me. Not me, but my best friend. Blame her. We yelled at her together. We screamed and cursed. She started crying, she kept apologizing. Pique consumed me. 
There was a three or four week period during which I stopped remembering my dreams completely, and savored their reentry so desperately that I promised to document every single one, and analyze them for meaning, maybe flesh out their content to write short stories. I thought if I respected my dreams, it would make them arrive with more frequency and depth. 
I don’t even want to think about what this dream means. Am I gross social climber who prioritizes the opinions of boys over the feelings of her friends? Does some form of social division exist between me and the person I’m closest to? Do I perpetuate it? Does she know that, and resent me for it? 
I do know that when I woke up, I ran to the window facing the driveway to check for scratches on my car. ♦

I feel weird and kinda disconnected. Not in a dissociation type way but from other people. I’ve had a lot of criticism for the people around me recently, and I wonder if it’s because I’m not satisfied with the people I’m surrounding myself with. As I get closer with my newer friends, the people I used to hang out with seem a lot less desirable. They’re still friends, though, and when they talk to me I feel that I should respond how a friend would, but it’s hard to act that way when all the feelings aren’t there anymore. I don’t want to be fake, but I don’t like hurting people’s feelings for something they can’t help. I just want everyone to be happy with the interactions we have. I feel as though I’m getting closer to finding people that the universe has intended for me. Is letting go of old friends is part of making room for new friends? I’m not sure, and it’s scary to not have all the answers, since I like knowing everything that’s going on around me. It’s a weird helpless feeling. ♦

A couple of days ago, I started writing a list of my favorite things in the notes app on my phone. The top of that list is: When comedians laugh at their own jokes. It has remained top of the list all week because I spend my days watching countless comedy videos. I love when they laugh so much; it’s so cute! It’s absolutely adorable to watch someone be so confident in themselves. It also confirms that there are people who enjoy what they do. 
It seems that every adult in my life dreads what they do. After hearing everyone complain about much they hate their job all the time, I wonder what it is I’ll end up doing when I get older. I know I love to write, but what if that doesn’t work out? I’m nervous that if I’m not careful, one day I’ll be the one complaining about how much I hate my job. I like to think I have a long time to decide about what I want to do, but in reality I don’t have much time to think about it. I’m grateful for every moment that I have to just think. ♦

Too often I find myself lounging around and scrolling past hundreds of Instagram squares, sleeping, waking up, yawning, and sleeping some more. Now that the warmth of summertime is here, and is actually nearing its end, I’m watching myself slink back into my natural state of rest-unrest. It’s weird, really, when at times I find myself yearning for a boost of endorphins (this is the part where I beg myself to go out and run), and then I’m suddenly hit by this wave-like laziness, which keeps me brooding for days.
It was last week when I initiated a daily running and jogging routine with an old pal from high school, having found my solitary running hours bleak and lonely. It’s also a coincidental plus that said pal just told me that she is trying to get back into shape after, what, a year of snoozing through alarms. Well, as they say, so far so good. We walked a shitload of miles four days ago, and did not stop until our bones felt like the insides of a man suffering from heartburn, until I protested and told her we should rest. The next day I woke up with bones that ached too loudly, which I sort of liked because I can play pretend that I’m hurt as I walk down the street wincing, giving rude men (and men, in general) the worst time of their lives, because, yes, that’s right, women feel pain, SO WHATCHU GONNA DO BUT LOOK AND LOVE ME AT MY WORST, etc. I’m becoming a li’l trickster, maybe, but for me it’s that I’m allowing myself this bit of craziness, this space to expand and thrive.
I’m sitting by the window as I write this with the sun sinking into the horizon, giving off a glow that only the sun can emit. Spectacular. Thirty minutes into writing this, the atmosphere changes, along with the light dimming and the air getting chiller as night approaches. I will be visiting my little old hometown the day after tomorrow. The thought fills me with a tingling excitement and an actual tingling, electric chill down the sides of my legs. The latter is a new sensation I felt three weeks ago, and I’m yet to consult WebMD about it. Anyway, the day after tomorrow, I’ll be on a bus bound to where all the monsters lurk. Wish me luck, my darlings, the luck-est of lucks.
P.S. I’d need books in order to survive the dread of my old hometown so I’m letting you know beforehand, in case my decisions change two days from now, that I’ll be bringing Charles Bukowski, Roland Barthes, and Virginia Woolf (my talisman) with me. ♦

I had my wisdom teeth taken out, so I’m currently living on painkillers and soft food. I’ve never been particularly good at dealing with pain. Sharp pain I can handle, but that’s because it usually subsides quite quickly. But the dull, achy pain of a toothache, or I guess, in this case, a gum ache, is so frustrating and just ouch. My mum has been looking after me. She made me soup on the first day and my dad bought me a bunch of yogurt and custard.
It was really strange when I woke up from the anesthetic: My tongue and bottom lip were numb and my throat ached. The nurses were busy around me and there was a strange moaning noise from the space in front of me. The nurse removed the tube from my arm and I was wheeled to another room where I was given water and yogurt.
I wasn’t too worried about the surgery because I know it’s something that many have gone through, and just before I was put to sleep I thought, If my dad can go through heart surgery then I can have my teeth taken out. ♦

Marriage is a partnership in which privacy almost entirely dissolves. Each partner knows nearly everything about the other, even the things that he or she normally hides from people. Certainly, this does not mean that they lack privacy altogether, but when the man, like Eastern men often do, insists on stripping his wife of her privacy, problems arise between them.
Since I was young, I have always had my own little private things that I kept to myself. Now my husband, Karam, tries to know every little thing that I feel or do. I feel my privacy is continuously violated and it has increasingly led to arguments between the two of us. Many Eastern men believe that they have the right to know everything about their wives. But I am not a naïve wife, and I will not let anybody, even my husband, rule over my desires and my personality. Yes, I do love Karam, but I am a rebel, and I will not let anybody strip me of my rights. I have lost too many of them already to the crisis in Syria, and I will not let that happen again, no matter what.
I have discovered over the last few months that Karam and I do not share the same opinions on many things, and that, in order for us to continue together, we’ll need to work on bridging the gap between us.
These differences are not shocking. My husband and I grew up in very different circumstances and environments, and our challenges as adults have been quite different, as well. Karam grew up in a family that had many issues. His father is a well-educated man, but his mother never cared about education. They were always very different, and Karam’s mother never tried to bridge the gap between her and Karam’s father. This environment impacted on Karam deeply, and he believes that his mother was the reason for his unhappy childhood. What he went through in his childhood still affects him today, even though he is a grown man. When I talk about how much my parents, and especially my mother, sacrificed for us, Karam is surprised that a woman would sacrifice her whole life for the sake of her kids. Sometimes he feels that my family is from a different planet—far removed from the one he knew as a child. He has openly mentioned many times that he would love to build a family similar to mine.
Eastern traditions and convictions have heavily influenced Karam. In Syria, there are still many families in which the man is the absolute leader, where the father bosses his wife and children around as if he were a military commander. But these habits do not fit our times. Women have developed—they do not accept being marginalized anymore, and they work hard to prove themselves. Women in my country are qualified and capable. They are powerful. Women in my country have unprecedented courage.
Arab and Eastern women gained their equal rights long ago, and religions consider them to be equal partners with men when it comes to family issues because they are responsible for raising children and building new generations. Unfortunately, there are always some who, due to poverty and lack of education, do not realize this truth.
In any case, I now find myself needing to play the role of Karam’s therapist, and help him get rid of these outdated ideas. Interestingly enough, while I felt that he was my therapist at the beginning, now I feel that I need to be the therapist in our relationship. I do believe that I can play that role. Why not? Karam is the father of my child and he deserves my hard work to help him.
The only thing that Karam doesn’t even try to discuss with me is my education. He knew from day one that my education was untouchable. My first and only condition in accepting his marriage proposal was that I would not quit my studies. This is why he encourages me to continue – and also because he knows that my education will positively influence our children in the future.
I do not doubt that, despite our differences, Karam and I will make a wonderful family. There is no perfect person, and we each certainly have our own issues. It is very important that we understand these issues and address them together. On my end, I will do whatever it takes to realize my dream and have a happy family. I will do that for the little child who is growing inside me, giving me strength and a greater ability to persevere with every step I take. ♦

Lately I feel like I’ve been seeing the future. My future. I see it in Tom Wolfe’s book The Right Stuff, and in The Right Kind of Crazy by Adam Steltzner (the guy who led the team to put the Curiosity rover on Mars), and in the physics textbook I found online to self study this summer, and in the class listings for special first-year seminars at my future alma mater—including the enchanting title “Extrasolar Planets and Astrobiology.” Sometimes the future is scary. Sometimes it looks like it’s going to be all work and no reward for the rest of my life. Sometimes it’s exciting anyway. In any case, it’s becoming altogether more clear.
It’s a kind of precognition that I know shows only one version of my future. It’s wont to change. Maybe all the people who do a double take when I say I want to go into physics will be right—”Physics?” they always repeat after me, “Really? Are you sure? Well, you know, almost everyone changes their major at least once. I would’ve pegged you for English myself.”
I smile without my teeth. “Yeah, who knows, right?”
But where those people used to foster doubt in me, now they foster defiance. Why are they so surprised? I want to ask. And not only that, but why does it have to be just one or the other? Maybe I like writing and math. Maybe I like learning how to think both ways—”use both sides of my brain,” my mom calls it. Maybe literary analysis and debugging programs aren’t as different as people seem to think they are.
So, to the person who said I would end up as a history major eventually, one way or another: If I leave the physical sciences completely, it’ll almost certainly be for linguistics. To the person who said this one programming problem was so easy, they wrote a solution using just two for loops, Lilly if you can’t do that then it’s just gonna get harder from here: I solved it using only one. To the person who said, all nice and condescending, that my answer to a calculus problem in class was so close, but not quite right, don’t worry, you’re almost there: You were doing it wrong. I checked. ♦

I love the feeling I get after watching Terminator 2: Judgment Day, on a grey day. It makes me feel so calm. 
I’ll be going back to school on Monday, which marks the end of the week off school. I’m definitely looking forward to the summer and listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers and watching Wayne’s World. School is really stressful for me because I daydream so easily and I can’t help being an anxious, stretchy-faced Jim Carrey loving person. If only I had the confidence that Jim Carrey has in the movie The Mask. When he’s Stanley, he’s a plain, nice guy who’s not extremely specific about what he wants. But when he puts on the mask, he becomes superhuman. I aspire to be like him. 
I’ve come to realize how much I love my own company. I only have my own thoughts to listen to, which means that I never misunderstand myself or get into arguments with myself. A recent conversation I’ve been having in my head is about how we, as humans, are born into this world of materialism and how everything is an advertisement, but when you try to break out of these boundaries, people try to pull you back under water. I’m honestly so sick of seeing the same models on Instagram. It’s so annoying that everyone looks the same. And even if the “diverse” look is trying to be achieved, it feels so forced. I never see Turkish Cypriot people in popular media. Maybe I’m not looking hard enough. However, I still wonder why my race is not positively portrayed. Sometimes, I feel as if I don’t even exist. It’s like the music video for the song “Role Model,” by Eminem—he disappears into an abyss while saying, “How can I be white, I don’t even exist.” I don’t feel like I have a clear identity that I can be proud of. 
I’m really lost, my cries for help muffled by the pile of recently bought clothes on top of me. I’m definitely guilty of buying my own acceptance: When I feel uncomfortable, I buy things to make myself feel better. I’m ashamed that I’m not truly comfortable in my own skin. If someone were to take my clothes away from me I would be nobody, and I’m not proud of that. 
I guess my desire to be noticed in this world is quite self-centred. I feel that I should focus more on being happy. The thing I love about happiness is that it can’t truly be defined because everyone has their own definition of happiness. For one person, buying an expensive car makes them happy, but for another, buying a peanut butter milkshake would make them just as happy. I know that I’ll be happy when I can feel comfortable with myself. I know that I want to start this journey of self-love and comfort toward myself in my thoughts and feelings. I’m going to stop invalidating my own thoughts. The things I think about are important. I matter just as much as anyone in this room, in this town, in this country, in this world. ♦

It’s June and school is so close to being over: June 23, I am free.
My peers have taken to wearing flip flops to school. This is both disgusting and sad, but also exciting, because it means we are all well aware of how little time we have left, and thus have stopped caring about adhering to social norms. 
My grades are, for the most part, finalized. They aren’t amazing, but they’re enough and so I will accept them. 
But there’s my chemistry grade. A 70.65 or maybe 70.62, or maybe lower, because I haven’t checked the Skyward app in about a week. A final grade, existing on a threshold, weakened with each passing day. Worksheets due weeks ago pile in my folder, myself unwilling to scratch the answers down. I cannot explain this phenomenon. I’m fearful of having a D as a final grade, yes, very fearful, but I also don’t want to open my backpack on the weekend or after school or anytime really. The work doesn’t get done, and I’m not sure it ever will. And all this, even before I have to contend with the final exam, a cumulative, anxiety-inducing, high-stakes fun fest coming up in about a week. 
I have this plan I devise in my head every night, before I lay to rest. I set an alarm for 6 AM and decide that from 6 AM to 7 AM I will do whatever chemistry work I need to show my teacher. Every morning, I silence or snooze said alarm, oversleep, and show up late to my first period class: chemistry. ♦

A couple of weeks ago, me and my sister listened in while my mom and my stepdad were fighting. I didn’t mind because my stepdad was making an ass of himself and my mom seemed mostly in control. It’s super rare that we see our mom reprimanding my stepdad. He’s always doing something annoying and when we tell her she puts it under wraps, which makes us feel like she respects him more than she does us; she has noooo issue putting us in or place in front of him, yet when he messes up nothing happens. 
Anyway, they were arguing about how my sister and I don’t make him feel welcome in the house. I thought that was ridiculous because ONE, Does he have any idea what it’s like to be two girls and have some strange man move in with you? And TWO, I thought I was doing a good job because I wrote him a letter that was basically a peace offering and we were doing fine. My mom called us downstairs and told us the issue. 
I was already annoyed because I’d only managed a couple hours of sleep the night before (thanks school), and I was ready to go to bed. As a result, I was not super engaged. On top of that, my stepdad was acting so so SO immature, it was unbelievable. The entire time he was cutting my mom off, being sarcastic, and laughing at what she was saying. It was so irritating to witness, when I knew my mom just wanted to diffuse the situation. It was really hard for me to watch him treat my mom that way. Everything down to his body language showed that he didn’t care about anything. He is also starting to act just like my dad who I consider emotionally abusive and recently, physically abusive. 
At this point, I feel like it’s important to mention that I hate starting problems like this. But every time I try to make sure everything is OK, I get pushed and agitated until I react badly. I don’t like getting angry, especially not because of other people. It makes me feel really helpless and out of control. One of the main triggers for that feeling is people not listening to me, especially when I haven’t done anything wrong, I don’t know why.
I started trying to say something, to be the voice of reason. I just wanted to stick up for my mom. But, although I listened to my stepdad when he spoke, whenever I tried to speak he cut me off. It hurt: I truly, truly hate not feeling heard. He kept provoking me, it was like he knew what he was doing. Then, when he saw me getting worked up he handed me his glasses and he’s like, “Go ahead and break them since you’re acting like a psycho.” That immediately set me off. I have issues with mental health that I’M not even ready to address, and here he is explicitly enabling my anger. I don’t think anyone’s ever done that before? I took them and I broke them, and I lashed out and ripped his shirt and broke his phone. 
I’m really disappointed in myself. Why do I always let people have this sort of control over me? I think part of what made this situation escalate was that it reminded me of my dad—I’m still really sore about all that went on with him. I hate how all of this started because he didn’t feel welcome but now I feel like I don’t belong anywhere. I’ve been working really hard so that my mom can change the custody so I don’t have to live at my dad’s anymore, but now that I have this issue with my stepdad everything is feeling a little impossible. I feel like I’m floating between two spaces that were never really mine to begin with. I try to hang out with friends more but anxiety doesn’t help with that. I find myself spending a lot of time alone, which is important and I understand that we all need to be able to be alone, but I think I’ve done a lot of being on my own. Now I feel lonely and it’s no fun at all. 
I have one year left of high school and getting out of here feels so far away. I don’t know if I’m ready to handle everything that’s bound to come this year. ♦

I am doing two things La Loba would scold me for: wearing a knee-length sweater in 86 degree weather and hiding from my problem, in the same room as the problem. There’s a stack of Freud at my feet and it reminds me of freshman year, when I sat here and proclaimed that I wanted to spend all of my time learning. My education didn’t arise from Nietzsche but from ashes and bunker corners and scouring my tongue over the kitchen sink. 
Yesterday: We walked into the graveyard after our time on the hill and I said it was my first. I had only visited the grey slabs in passing trains where my mother bit all my fingertips when I pointed at them. “Don’t you know it’s bad luck?” she said. “Never do that again.” All of the names are Irish or Italian with Eastern Europeans in between. The sky is too flat here and all the angels look the same. 
Mausoleum passing. “Why do some of them have tiny houses?” he asks. I love his questions. “What a waste of space. This is why I don’t want a grave. I don’t want to be a waste of space.” 
“I don’t want a funeral. I don’t even want to be buried. But I also don’t want to be cremated.” I think about how I never thought my mother would lose her body. “Honestly, when I die, they can just throw me in the trash.” I like the way we talk because there is truth in all of our jokes. 
We reach a crossroads. “Which way?” he asks. Eenie-meenie-miney-mo, yes or no—that way. I point and we walk. “It’s another hill,” he says. He skated the last one we were at. 
“I’m gonna do it,” I say, resting my board down. 
“No, I don’t want you to get hurt.” He said this last time, but this road is worse and the cracks are unforgiving. I’ll be fine. It’s a worthy trade-off. I feel him watch me as I go. ♦

I don’t know how to write about this. I don’t know where to begin. Ever since I heard about recent events in Orlando I’ve been shunting aside everything I’ve been feeling, telling myself I’ll deal with my own personal reaction later. Focus on work, focus on friends, Awareness, knowledge of what happened, that’s different. I internalize well; I can separate the emotions from the events. But I have to deal with both sides of the equation eventually. Solve for x, solve for y.
I’ve always wanted to go to Pride. Now, on some level, I am afraid to.
That is difficult to deal with.
My coming out story can probably be summed up as “easy,” at least in hindsight. I only ever directly said the words “I think I like girls” once, to my mom. In fact, I’m sitting here writing this in the very same place where I said that out loud for the first time. My friends all took it well. Nothing really changed. That doesn’t mean I was able to magically put an end to all of my confusion. Did I only like girls? Could I see myself ending up with someone of another gender? How does my own gender play into it all, anyway? These are questions I still haven’t answered. I still struggle to attach any definite labels to myself, although I absolutely support those who do.
But even if my coming out was that “easy,” god, sometimes it seems like just existing as the person I am is hard. I often feel like I try to convince myself that I have it easy in general, and maybe it’s true, that my situation is a good one. I have a roof over my head, and family and friends who love me. That doesn’t mean I’m immune to the fear. Not just for myself—for all LGBTQ people, especially Latinx and black people in Orlando, and Muslims affected by Islamophobia all over the country, and kids still “in the closet” who might see these events on the news and keep their mouths shut.
God, I don’t know how to keep going. To keep writing about this, that is.
I know how to keep going. A friend just texted me asking if I want to make a trip to a pride festival in the nearest big city with them in a couple of weeks. And I am still afraid. But maybe I will say yes. ♦

When Dad took me to his work in downtown San Diego, I had my camera in one hand and my phone in the other for navigation. I have this idea that if you look like you’re on a mission, no one will try to get in your way. No one sane, at least. Well, I guess that’s not too reassuring. 
I am sure the college kids working at Blick Art Materials thought I was stealing. My overalls could be viewed as conspicuous, I suppose. On my final trip there, I bought four small oil pastels. All pink tones. As I did it, I thought about Barnaby Whitfield, my current fav artist.
I carried my oil pastels a mile or two back to the Coffee Bean by Civic Center. For once, I pulled out my sketchbook and tried to be a cool artist and draw some people I saw outside the window. I started down the trail of self-hate, because it all looked like my personal style of crap and it was twenty steps backwards from the art I’d been creating with paint. I suppose I shouldn’t be upset since I don’t use pastel often, but, of course, that wasn’t good enough an excuse for me. 
“That’s really good!” 
The words were similar to what everyone says, but the tone of voice was completely new. It wasn’t a mom trying to pad or some nice art hoe kid. She really thought it was good. OK then. 
I was immediately indebted to her and her genuineness. She was a suit, like 80 percent of the city, but clothes were just clothes on her when she had those eyes and that voice to make people believe her with. 
I thought that was it. The interaction was over and I could cool down. 
But she said it again, and I panicked. I’m sitting here trying to remember the words that bridged that moment to the next—when she asked where I wanted to go to school. Oh yeah, she said that suits are all secretly jealous of artists and really need them to survive. I almost hated her, but then she said something amazing that I haven’t heard before, “Hey, you’re never going to see me again, so just tell me what you really want to do.” 
And I did. 
“Alyson, you just have a very trusting and kind aura. Believe me, I don’t talk to random strangers all the time.” 
I walked down the street and didn’t have enough eye-energy to launch tears. Anyways, I had to find my dad. ♦

This has been a trying week. Not all of the trying has been negative, but there have been plenty of opportunities for me to grow as a person. 
I began the week with an interview at my favorite magazine. I’d spent the couple of days before feeling absolutely terrified. My fear turned into me nitpicking my outfit selection for the day. It even turned physical: I felt queasy and lightheaded most of the way there. To me, it was a stepping stone, but one I didn’t think I would even have a shot at until years down the line. I arrived 30 minutes early. Hoping to waste some time, I popped into a Starbucks close to the building. 
I began to size myself up in the morning, rattling off positive affirmations, hoping to believe in them enough to get me through the moments ahead. I had this image of walking into a bustling office, filled to the brim with gorgeous talented people whom I had long admired, and just not stacking up. I’m a obsessed with media, especially magazines, and other tactile forms. I spent a large part of my early years soaking up New York radio, reading my parents’ issues of Vibe, Source, and XXL magazines. Who took the pictures? Who was the editor in chief? Danyel Smith-era Vibe and coverage of NY rap circa 2011 was instrumental in my desire to become a music journalist. 
I had these excessively high aspirations, most of them tied to what I thought it meant to be a music journalist. Most of them, I now realize, wouldn’t be considered professional anyway, such as getting in with the rapper and their squads because I was “one of the boys” and then capturing them in the moments that haven’t been discussed in interviews. When I had a new favorite artist, I watched and read all their interviews on YouTube, and was often disappointed when journalists would ask them the same questions. “How did your group get its name?” I’d think, Did you bother to research them? 
The lines between the interviewee and the media personality interviewing them are increasingly blurred. Many media personalities spend so much time cultivating their own brands and stardom that it affects their ability to do their job. I love and care about pop culture, especially black American culture. It isn’t a joke to me. To see it treated as such by media companies that built themselves up by covering rap and other black art forms, is disheartening. 
Although, I’ve taken a little break from my obsession with rap and the idea of being a music journalist, I’m still wary of gatekeepers. I watch Hot 97 personalities think that it’s cool to take shots or ask generic questions with younger guests, which I see as blatant disrespect. I just know for a fact that I can do their job one thousand percent better than them. 
We’re in a space now where there is no clear set path to get to where you want to go. Whereas before in the past, you’d go to school for broadcast journalism, and then internship, and then and then. That doesn’t exist anymore! I have a whole list of people and I’m coming for their spots, because I know I can do it! I can do it! I just need to get out of my own head to do so. ♦

I don’t know what to start with this week. I was going to write about being liked back by someone for the first time in over a year, and the first time ever by a boy, and then the Pulse shooting happened and gripped my morning. I was going to write about Pulse and how heavy it made me feel and how it intersected with my recent thoughts on my own sexuality and how strange it’s been being queer while so involved with a boy when another personal crisis blitzkrieged my day, leaving me at a complete loss for breath and blood and everything that reminded me that I was alive. I don’t know what to do with myself. I don’t know how to stop thinking about my own problems without dropping my ego somewhere where it can’t be recovered. 
My grade is on a college trip right now and it is so hard to keep myself upright, to be centered and well and not constantly in the midst of a stomach pain or quieting the pounding for validation in my head. My mom always told me that I made myself sick with my worrying, and it is true. All of my stressors are mammoths in my mind, trampling the calm savannas of “happy places” and the unmoving upstate air. 
The boy and I—we talk about where I will be in a few years. It is the day before I leave. He wonders what I’ll be doing. “So do I,” I say. Unsure footing is my constant. 
“You watching you,” he replies. “Me watching you watching you.” I’m too tired to be happy.
“Just like television.” 
“Better than television,” he says. Of course. I can always figure out our script. Nine times out of 10 it makes me feel better. This time is a rare miss. I still feel confused, stuck on the prospect of not being good enough, of being the domestic bore ignored in daylight and returned to in the comfort of privacy. Being ignored and coming in last does this to me. 
I fear anything owning my heart like this. I don’t know when the loan became permanent but I do know that my existence is now tethered to something greater than itself, something extending beyond another person. It is not just him but the way I feel about him, the strength of the ability to relate this deeply to another person, and the potential for all of that to undo the pieces of my foundation this same connection laid down. None of these are new concerns—only the vulnerability is a changed brand. 
I am in five different knots. He makes me feel like my life is a strip of light with no years to contain or restrain it, and he makes me feel like I am back in the woods waiting for the hatchet to stain my nightgown’s back with the final blow. 
Trusting, or even beginning to trust a man feels like one of the greatest betrayals that I could ever enact upon myself. I am the one who taught myself to be unmoving in the face of evil, the one who has understood the manipulations of beauty that men tirelessly weave and then lay down for the next day’s catch. 
What have I done? 
Where are we going?

Sometimes when I see my friends interacting with their mothers I get an odd feeling. But never in the years that it had plagued me have I been able to pinpoint exactly what it was. I defer feeling things. Is that common? In the midst of awkward, angry, or otherwise traumatic situations I remain numb. That is, until I can no longer handle not feeling and suddenly feel EVERYTHING. This can happen at the most inconvenient of times, like right before my Spanish final or in the middle of an event that I’d been looking forward too. One second I’m fine and enjoying myself and the next I’m sobbing in front of my entire class. I even wrote this paragraph as a device to procrastinate writing about my actual feelings. See? Over the years I’ve gotten really good at it.
But I think that’s enough procrastinating. A few weeks ago, I was doing my usual review of my day where, right before bed, I think about everything I did that day and decide if there are things I’d like to do again. I remembered a moment when my friends mother had called her out of the blue to tell her that she loved her. The feeling that I’ve come to know spread like a bitter cold through my stomach and I busied myself with playing around on my phone until my friend hung up. As I lay in bed that night, I know I started to feel something, but I told myself that I was too tired and fell asleep. 
This morning I woke up thinking about it. I don’t know why it was suddenly on my mind again but it was and I knew what the feeling was: I was angry. I’m so angry that I don’t get those random calls from my mom, to let me know that she loves me. I’m hurt that I don’t get to talk to her about the things that you’re supposed to talk to your mom about. I’m so ashamed that I’m crying as I write this. I can’t let my siblings know that this still hurts, that I’m still upset about it, because we are supposed to be stronger than our feelings. I’m supposed to lead by example and tears aren’t a sign of strength. 
I wish I didn’t love my mom so much because then it would be easy to not know how she’s doing. I really want to hate her so that I don’t feel bad about avoiding talking to her. But I love her with all my heart, and I miss her. ♦

Thoughts from the void, or things I’ve thought and written down today.
i. OK, what am I writing? I’m trying to distract myself and prevent a panic attack. 
ii. Loud people sitting next to me—a bit awkward. 
ii. Life is so complicated and inconvenient. Some people get to stroll through like it’s nothing, but most of us have to wade through a swamp, maybe climb up a hill. Then there are those who have to defeat Everest. 
iii. Oh no! Straight people are kissing—pardon me, making the fuck out. Not that if a gay couple were making out on public transport I wouldn’t be mildly uncomfortable, but when they’re straight I pretend that we live in a world where straight couples are considered perverse and different. 
iv. Swearing has lost all meaning, the word fuck no longer has the same effect it once did. There was a time when “crap” would get you grounded, now you might as well be calling a bunny cute. ♦

I am literally blaming all of my unruly emotions on being a Sagittarius and it has a surprisingly calming effect on me. 
God, everything hurts. Everything is a battle. Mind and body. The body, uncompromising in what it wants. The mind, a leash. The mind is really no fun. 
When I feel like I can’t eat, which one is that? My body doesn’t want food. It wants him. My mind, maybe, being logical. But that, too, wants to standby in the case of any unforeseen emotional changes. 
I thought I liked the game until I saw what it could do to me. Food is just a piece and I can’t breathe in church. I went mad in Wings and Things. 
I liked the game until I no longer had the upper hand. ♦

Pride is this weekend, and because of what happened in Orlando and the threats of violence at different Pride events around the country, a lot of my friends are starting to feel scared to go. It’s weird because everyone I know looks forward to Pride, and San Francisco Pride is probably one of the biggest celebrations in the country. So it’s really sad that everyone is on the fence this year. It’s more shocking because our city is really accepting of queer people, in my experience. But I guess Orlando could have been really accepting and what happened still happened. It only takes one person to do something like that. 
I’m trying not to be scared and my weird coping mechanism is to remind myself that someone got shot at San Francisco Pride last year and I wasn’t super scared then so I shouldn’t be scared now. But now it’s different as a queer girl: Queer people are being targeted. It makes me so upset that someone could just go and ruin lives and instill fear in an entire community. I’ve been dreaming about Pride since last year! I have so many more friends now, and I’m even gonna be in the parade!!! So I don’t want to be scared, I want to have a really good time. I really hope that happens. ♦

I keep having flashbacks of things that occurred during my time in the hospital, 10 months ago. 
Since I’m still not completely ready to talk about it, I won’t go into complete detail, but 10 months ago I had scoliosis correctional surgery. Scoliosis is the “abnormal” curvature of the spine, which meant that my spine was in a “S”-type shape. I found out I had it when I was 12, in September 2014. The doctors said I’d had it since birth, but it starts to develop more when the person goes through puberty. I can’t explain how different I felt after I came home from the doctor that day. I was so envious of my classmates for having such minuscule problems. 
The time between my diagnosis and my surgery was very rough for me: People at school made fun of me for wearing my back brace, I was always in excruciating pain, and I felt like everyone felt sorry for me. Even some of my family members made me feel weird and didn’t except that I’m still the same girl, just with a health issue. And I say health issue because scoliosis doesn’t just affect someone’s body, it can push into the person’s lungs if the case is severe, like mine was.
In August, I had my surgery and stayed home from school for six weeks (one of the coolest times of my life). But there were things that happened in the hospital that I’m trying to forget. I don’t like remembering the way I couldn’t walk with ease, or how I couldn’t sit up for more than five minutes without getting tired. The worst was having to have an enema, but I won’t go into detail because it’s a bit too disgusting. I’m completely back to normal now, but I guess it’s hard to forget the pain I was in.
Surgery was the best choice I could’ve made, but it had a stronger mental impact than I thought it would. ♦

I wish people would stop projecting their ideas of what I should look like and be when I didn’t ask them. So many people tell me how “bad” my afro shrinkage is and how I should do more twist outs or get braids again. I love shrinkage, it means my hair is healthy. I used to be obsessed with twisting my hair every night to make it look longer when I took it out in the morning, so I’d look more feminine. But I’ve gotten over that now, and that’s something I’m very proud of because I used to loathe my nappy hair. I was so ashamed of the tight puff it would curl into after a shower that if I didn’t do a twist out I made sure to wear a hat so no one could see my undefined curls. So I find it really unsettling when someone tells me I should go back to feeling that way. It’s like asking me to go continually dip myself in boiling water that singes off my skin.
I’ve been getting so much better at accepting myself for who I am and loving my looks and personality. I’ll never be the most graceful or typically attractive. I’m still beautiful anyway, and so what if I don’t abide by patriarchal white supremacist standards of beauty? I even feel better about my scoliosis! Whenever I feel insecure about my body compared to the able bodied images I see every day I just say, “My body is too punk rock for the rest of the world!”
So many people think they know me and my reasoning for doing certain things. I’ve been wearing mostly bodycon dresses for most of the spring and summer simply because they’re more comfortable than shorts. But a few weeks ago, I went to Brooklyn to visit a “friend” and when I got to his place and told him how awkward it was to be cat called and followed down the street on my way there, he argued that the main reason men are doing that to me is because I have a big butt and wearing a tight dress just accentuates it. “You know what you’re doing,” is what he said. Then he proceeded to get mad at me because he admitted that my physique also aroused him and he thought I was silly to be mad at comments about my body while I’m dressed like that. His harsh words made me uneasy, and when I gave him a piece of my mind about his bullshit opinion of me I was suddenly “taking it too personally” and just acting in a disrespectful manner because I’m young, when really he was the one being inappropriate with me. I wasn’t going to put up with that, so I left his place.
It’s really maddening to know that I have no control over my body and how it’s viewed, that I can’t wear something without someone assuming I’m after attention. It’s just like, Why are you concerned about me? It’s my body and I’ll do what I want with it. 
When I was growing up and even now, whenever I express discomfort with something done to me, or defend myself from mean jibes I’m turned into the bitch who should be fine with being stepped all over and ridiculed. I’m expected to be quieter than other people because I’m this tiny black girl who’s just supposed to make sure everyone else around me is happy and not pay any mind to my own comfort. Sometimes there’s nothing more painful than having to apologize for being genuinely upset about being disrespected or abused. It used to makes me so emotional that I’d cry about it at times. But in recent years, it got worse because, as I grew older, I was taught to hold it in. That’s why now it’s so important for me to trust myself, and love myself, because so many people try to trick me out of my emotions or gaslight me, and I still don’t always let my feelings manifest into actual concerns. I get manipulated into thinking I’m overreacting, or that my disgust with the way someone treats me actually makes me the nuisance, and I’m supposed to comfort my abuser. 
Accepting myself has helped me understand that my emotions are as real as can be, and that I have a right to own them and share them when I feel unsafe. I feel so much more like myself again: The girl who’s not afraid to fight back and tell someone off when they’re being a jerk. I’m overjoyed to be finally getting back to that place. A year ago it seemed impossible—I thought I’d never get back to being confident assertive girl I once knew. But here I am now, aware that I am worthy and pretty in my own way. I’m perfectly me. Nappy hair and all. ♦

The parade is bright and beautiful and everything I imagined. Float after float goes by—radio stations blasting music, clothing companies on publicity stunts, LGBTQ+ organizations in full pride attire. Walkers fling strands of beads and wristbands into the crowd, hands going up at lightning speed to pluck them out of the sky. “FREE HUGS,” someone has Sharpied across their collarbones. Behind us people shoulder through the swarm with armfuls of T-shirts and flags and bracelets, shouting to be heard through the din, more focused on selling their wares than the spectacle going by in the road. But they’re as much a part of things as everyone else is. They’re another splotch of rainbow in the whirlwind of color that has taken over the city.
I’m not good around that many people. By the time the parade is over I’m about ready to burst, and we still have hours of elbowing our way through crowds ahead of us. But it’s still good. At the end of the day I’ve walked more than eight miles and drunk what feels like gallons of overpriced water from convenience stores and pop-up stands along the route. I’m sunburned but not sorry for it. The sunset on the two-hour drive home looks like the parade all over again.
What worries me, later, is how easy it is for those colors to fade in my memory. Because now, at home, it feels like I just woke up and the last two days were just some fever dream, swallowed up neat by the immediacy of reality. It feels wrong to complain about going to work, going back to my usual routine, but an interruption like that is hard to deny. Two days of doing more walking than eating and now I can’t stomach breakfast without nausea eating away at my gut. I’m so tired that my contacts sting my eyes and I can hardly focus, barely enough fight in me to figure out what I need to wear today. And maybe these are all just metaphors for depression resurgent, because Pride was beautiful but I didn’t really feel like a part of it, and that didn’t really hit me until after I made it home. I don’t really feel like I’m part of much at all right now. But I’ll get through it. I’ll go to work and smile blandly at customers and then I’ll come home and I’ll be able to sleep again. Right now that’s enough of a reward. ♦

I had a dream the other night that my best friend was parallel parking my car at a party, and while doing so, scraped the car of a very cute boy. (Note: Both my best friend and the very cute boy are real people I interact with on a daily to almost-daily basis.) In the aforementioned dream, I walked out of the party to discover my car stopped in the middle of the street—with a line of paint missing from its right hand side, and a matching absence on the car of the very cute boy. 
My best friend remained in the driver’s seat, too shocked and embarrassed to exit the car. It almost annoyed me she felt this way, because I wasn’t mad at all. The scratches didn’t seem severe, in fact I could barely make them out. But then the boy exited his car, yelling, and cursing, out of character for him, and indicative of a serious offense. And suddenly a streetlight became brighter, revealing deep dents in both cars, ruined doors, thousands of dollars worth of damage. I apologized to the boy profusely, but the only condolence that came to mind was “I’m sorry for who did this.” In my head, I needed to keep reminding him of that: my car, but not me. Not me, but my best friend. Blame her. We yelled at her together. We screamed and cursed. She started crying, she kept apologizing. Pique consumed me. 
There was a three or four week period during which I stopped remembering my dreams completely, and savored their reentry so desperately that I promised to document every single one, and analyze them for meaning, maybe flesh out their content to write short stories. I thought if I respected my dreams, it would make them arrive with more frequency and depth. 
I don’t even want to think about what this dream means. Am I gross social climber who prioritizes the opinions of boys over the feelings of her friends? Does some form of social division exist between me and the person I’m closest to? Do I perpetuate it? Does she know that, and resent me for it? 
I do know that when I woke up, I ran to the window facing the driveway to check for scratches on my car. ♦

I feel weird and kinda disconnected. Not in a dissociation type way but from other people. I’ve had a lot of criticism for the people around me recently, and I wonder if it’s because I’m not satisfied with the people I’m surrounding myself with. As I get closer with my newer friends, the people I used to hang out with seem a lot less desirable. They’re still friends, though, and when they talk to me I feel that I should respond how a friend would, but it’s hard to act that way when all the feelings aren’t there anymore. I don’t want to be fake, but I don’t like hurting people’s feelings for something they can’t help. I just want everyone to be happy with the interactions we have. I feel as though I’m getting closer to finding people that the universe has intended for me. Is letting go of old friends is part of making room for new friends? I’m not sure, and it’s scary to not have all the answers, since I like knowing everything that’s going on around me. It’s a weird helpless feeling. ♦

A couple of days ago, I started writing a list of my favorite things in the notes app on my phone. The top of that list is: When comedians laugh at their own jokes. It has remained top of the list all week because I spend my days watching countless comedy videos. I love when they laugh so much; it’s so cute! It’s absolutely adorable to watch someone be so confident in themselves. It also confirms that there are people who enjoy what they do. 
It seems that every adult in my life dreads what they do. After hearing everyone complain about much they hate their job all the time, I wonder what it is I’ll end up doing when I get older. I know I love to write, but what if that doesn’t work out? I’m nervous that if I’m not careful, one day I’ll be the one complaining about how much I hate my job. I like to think I have a long time to decide about what I want to do, but in reality I don’t have much time to think about it. I’m grateful for every moment that I have to just think. ♦

My Queer Straight Alliance was invited to talk to the United States Representative Barbara Lee about our club and what we do. It was really exciting because I remember there being a “Barbara Lee speaks for me” poster in my third grade science class. It’s weird to think about how big of a deal she is!
A few people from our club’s leadership came and we each prepared something to talk to her about. I talked about what’s so great about our QSA. I think since my anxiety isn’t so bad anymore I was really able to do a good job! I talked about why we’re titled QSA and not GSA (we chose queer over gay to be more inclusive), and our peer education presentations (we go around to classes to talk about LGBTQ+ issues and safety. I also talked about a gender-neutral bathroom petition the ninth graders made—we got gender-neutral bathrooms, too!!!
One of my friends brought copies of our peer ed script and gave it to Congresswoman Lee and she was so cool: She said that it was really good and asked if she could use it to talk to those of her colleagues who are ignorant on this subject. That was SUPER weird, because I just go to high school and have issues with this stuff, but she works in Washington, D.C. with a ton of government people. I can’t believe that she deals with the same problems as we do. She told us she was really proud of us for making the script—which felt good because every part of the script was written by the members of our club—and we’d done an amazing job of covering the acronym, the gender binary, stereotypes, and fluidity. It feels really good that something we put a lot of work into is receiving praise. Afterwards, we got to take a picture with her. 
I’m glad I went, especially because I was considering not going because I have a bad history with someone else who attended. On the day, we ended up being totally fine with each other and it was actually really nice. They’re a senior and graduating in a month, so it felt nice to have this one last good moment to remember when I think about them.
It’s kinda scary to think so many of my friends will be leaving this year. My whole time in high school I’ve been denying that this day would come because, until now, it has been far away. But now that time is here. It’s bittersweet. I’m happy that everyone is going off to college to do what they love, but I’m gonna miss them tons—everyone is going so far away. I’m scared to lose touch with friends, even as I know that it’s bound to happen since they’ll be far away and busy and I will be, too. I think, though, that it’s best to try to stay optimistic and keep in mind that no matter how far away someone is they can still feel really close. ♦

I cried over the President on Sunday. Thrice.
Usually when I say I cried about something, I’m just exaggerating for effect. I’ll admit that I overuse and misuse the phrase, but in terms of yesterday, actual tears came out of my eyes, and my face was puffy for almost 20 minutes after.
The Electoral College, the keepers of democracy in these United States, made Barack Obama President when I was 10 years old. I remember the day after his election, my nanny took me to Whole Foods to buy a snack for the celebratory party we were having in school that day. We were both wearing Barack Obama T-shirts; she a middle aged Jamaican woman, and me, a white-passing mixed race girl. Normally, there’s an air of tension in overpriced health food stores. The cashiers are generally young black kids, and the customers, as WASP-y as they get. I always feel very uncomfortable, watching the racial biases of America play out in the grocery line. But not on November 5, 2008. On this day, it was like every single white person in the store wanted to hold hands with my nanny, me, and all the cashiers, while singing Kumbaya or Aretha Franklin. I remember my nanny engaging in lengthy conversation with a suited-up limousine liberal about how Obama showed her son that there were legitimate opportunities available to him as a black man, past the drug trade or professional sports. The man didn’t listen to her speak with a look of shock or disgust. He didn’t patronize her either. He just listened, and smiled, genuinely, and told us that he was excited for America.
Maybe we thought that racism would die. Maybe we were just sick of Dubya. I don’t remember how exactly I felt, besides excited to make fun of the kids with Republican parents at school, but I should’ve savored those moments
Obama was re-elected when I was in eighth grade. At the time, Hurricane Sandy had smacked the hell out of the Northeast, so I was preoccupied. I wish I’d savored this time, too. I wish I’d understood that it’s not every day a President is re-elected. It’s not every day this President is Barack Obama.
Through the most pivotal time in my life—my coming of age—the most famous figure in America was a mixed-race black man with whom I shared similar political beliefs. He was the age of my own parents, and had two kids who were the age of my brother and I. His dog was hypoallergenic like mine. He listened to Kendrick Lamar and appeared on Between Two Ferns. One time, he called Kanye West a jackass. He wore a khaki suit once, because FUCK IT! He was handsome. He was cool. He was—the best.
I will be 18 when Barack Obama turns the Presidency over—not to D*****d T****p, I hope. I dread this day.
But, I will savor these my last few months with Obama. I’ll try to save my tears for once he’s actually gone. ♦

Time passes so quickly. Even when life feels like it is going very slowly, we look back at a certain point and realize that it was all just the blink of an eye. Last week was the anniversary of my father’s death. He has been gone for three years now. It hasn’t been easy at all. When we were in Eastern Ghouta we were hungry, deprived of necessities, and oppressed. Then, after we moved to the capital, Damascus, we continued to live in fear and humiliation, and when we left the country, we risked our lives by sea to reach Europe, and eventually Switzerland.
Although my internal scars—from wounds I suffered during five years of bloody civil war—never fully allow me to enjoy my new life, I do acknowledge that my life in this country has significantly improved lately.
My mother risked everything to allow us to live normal lives in a place free of daily violence. When I look back, I find it hard to comprehend how much fear and misery we lived with, and the amount of patience and strength we demonstrated. My mother kept us strong. She gathered us around her and provided us with the support we needed. She is the reason we survived.
Losing a father is one of the hardest things a person can go through. I still cry every time I think of him. He was our shelter, our protection, and our safety. And although my mother has done her best to provide us with the safety and protection we need, I’ll always miss my father’s presence. No one could ever fill the void he has left in my soul. For me, mothers are a source of love, but fathers are a source of safety—neither can take the place of the other.
I do not know why I insist on looking back when I promised myself I wouldn’t, but thinking about my father has made me remember all of the details of the past five years. When I think about what has happened to us—especially in the three years since my father died—I find it hard to believe that my siblings and I have managed to start over, despite the physical, mental, and emotional destruction that we witnessed.
Apparently the Syrian crisis could not destroy us, and perhaps it has even strengthened us. I sometimes wonder whether it was only because of my mother that we managed to survive, or whether it was the love, the strength and the principles on which we were raised that sustained us, too. My father was a part of that. He provided us with the tools we needed to overcome the challenges we faced—he surrounded us with love and stability. It was not all because of my mother, rather, it was something that both of my parents established within us. It’s true that we feel weak sometimes, and that we stumble and fall, but we will always get back up again, stronger and more determined than ever.
I look back at what I have accomplished in just the past few months. After five years of war, I’ve managed to move to Switzerland, to marry, and very soon I will become a mother. Above all of that, I feel that I do not want to limit myself to being merely a wife and a mother. I have to continue with my studies because I have dreams and plans for things outside the kitchen or the house. I know that I must keep working on myself. I must become stronger and tougher. Life is full of surprises, as we Syrians now well know, and I should be prepared for them. Education will give me the tools to face any challenges that come. I’m working hard at learning German; it is the first step toward real security. At some point, I thought that being married would provide me with safety, but I’ve realized that marriage is just one little piece, and I need to work hard on the other pieces by myself—and I will do that.
When I think of my parents and how much strength they gave us, I wonder if I will be able to give my own child the same strength especially when I’m far away from my home country that I miss so much. I guess only time will provide me with an answer. ♦

Moments that are currently helping me cope with the gray and the showers and myself: Lilya 4-Ever. A video of a woman who loves eating dirt that she gathers from beneath a trench near her shack. The vomit scene in Possession.
In my room I can hear every instance of running water in the apartments above us. We are a bunker family of two. I have no window, and when I turn off the light to sleep, I can feel everything that was hidden before in all the votive offerings come out and watch me. I never try to face what I fear anymore. I suddenly lack the resources. 
I don’t sleep without waking up throughout the night. The heat and the wall clamors and the black atmosphere of the entire home make me feel like I am compressed in the far regions of a giant’s brain. My dreams have manifested as something that interests me more than it scares me, and I remember that I have stupidly neglected to protect myself. I lay out the sage to smudge but I never do it. I am too used to relying on thoughts over action. 
I see a movie where the sisters’ mother comes back from the dead through the trunk of a car and I feel lied to. I look for her everywhere but I can only feel. I am not content with this. I have never had enough. ♦

My mind floats, as a five-star cruise ship does. This brain is a vessel of dreams, longings, thoughts—all sacred or diabolic.
My bones, I remember them straining to push through the 5 AM alarm. Silly, a 5 AM alarm for a 7:30 AM test. I took a bath without an ounce of consciousness. All was motor memory. I may have blinked a few times as I rode a jeepney, at 6:45 AM, which made the man I was sitting across from think that I was flirting. (“In this too young a time in the morn, dear sir??”) I was itching to get coffee, or to go back to bed.
The only good thing about waking up early is the warm feeling of recognition that tugs at me: The recognition that I am here, and that along with everybody else, I am moving about to go somewhere, to be someone. It’s like watching the waves in the ocean tumble about and wanting to reach and move in time with them. How I wish I can could close my eyes and store this feeling, so I can reach for it—as a thirsty person reaches for water—whenever I need to catch that vibe.
I arrived way too early for the college application test, so I hung out outside the testing room. There were three other women waiting, all of them on their phones. I wanted to talk to them, but I decided against it; I read The Waves on my phone instead. I’m at the restaurant-meeting part, the part where they bid Percival goodbye, when my reading is interrupted by three, four, and then five people pulling chairs. The sound of the metal chair legs against the tiles, gritty and annoying, snapped everyone in the room out of their respective worlds, out of their phones, making the newcomers, who already sat, fidgety, not quite knowing what to do, look around as if waiting for a cue, or a question. I met their gazes, inferring that they were also test takers. This brought to mind the part in The Waves I’d just read: “The hostility, the indifference of other people dining here is oppressive. We look at each other; see that we don’t know each other, stare, and go off. Such looks are lashes. I feel the whole cruelty and indifference of the world in them.” I nod and whisper, “Yes, and I am both you and the indifferent people.”
Last Friday morning was slow. It went slowly, more slowly than I would’ve liked it to. Midday came like a sharp intake of breath. The sun was scorching my brain, and my kindness toward the world dissipated.
Meanness comes naturally to me at the moment. People have been making me feel unworthy of generating kindness. This is a really bad thing, I know, but I can’t help it. Anyone can dub me “insensitive,” and it hurts me so much to think that. I remember the tone, the cadence, the lilt in someone’s voice whenever they show me how I appear before their eyes. I am so hurt, so hurt by the world. I feel as though I’m becoming a truly horrible, grouchy person—a way of being I’ve always avoided and feared.
What is happening to my mind? ♦

April saw my call for late nights with friends, which I mentioned in an earlier diary entry, answered. I’ve been getting to experience those clichéd teen movie moments that I longed for, and I couldn’t be happier. 
This weekend went to The Museum of Contemporary Art’s teen night “Go Home.” It was amazing. When I arrived with my friends Natalie and Paola, I was surprised by my friend Andrew who I haven’t seen in a year. Together we made made our own pins (beyond cute), took in a lot of amazing art, and saw some really cool bands. Our goal for the night was to each introduce ourselves to at least one new person. At first it was really intimidating because everyone there was so beautiful, but after convincing myself that, Hey! I’m beautiful too, duh! it was a lot easier, and I was happy to see how accepting and loving everyone was. It was a great experience and whoever decided to include tangerines and bananas on the snack table deserves a gold star. My friends and I finished the night the only way you can finish a night like this, with milkshakes and mozzarella sticks. How’s that for a Teen Movie Moment? ♦

Books you should read, A to Z.
A is for Allison Hewitt is Trapped, my favorite teen zombie novel. 
B is for The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are. Alan Watts‘ essays are the reason I question the nature of reality. 
C is for Chicken Soup for the Soul. The editions for teenagers are full of wonderful and heartwarming stories. 
D is for The Moth Diaries. There is something mysterious about this novel that places it on my favorite list. 
E is for Eat, Pray, Love. Elizabeth Gilbert has written the only hetero/cis love story that I can actually abide.
F is for A Little F’d Up, a beginner’s guide to feminism. 
G is for My New Gender Workbook this book brought me to question my identity and confirm it all in the same sitting. 
H is for Harry Potter and the…, seriously how have you not read all of the Harry Potter books?
I is for It’s Kind of a Funny Story. When I first realized i was mentally ill, Ned Vizzini’s 2006 novel made me feel accepted and understood.
J is for Jane Eyre, we all need a classic.
K is for The Impossible Knife of Memory, Laurie Halse Anderson’s novel tells an important story with very realistic characters. 
L is for Looking for Alaska, because even though I‘m not always here for John Green, I still enjoyed this book.
M is Mister God, This Is Anna. I’ve read this book three times and each time I learn something new and take something different away with me. 
O is for The Outsiders, a book we were made to read at school but that I will remember forever.
P is for The Perks of Being a Wallflower, because I felt a connection to the protagonist Charlie. 
R is for The Rookie Yearbooks—all of them…Do I really need to explain why?
S is for Speak, another novel by Laurie Halse Anderson telling a story that it was important for me to read.
T is for The Christmas Mystery, a Norwegian novel by Jostein Gaarder. It is my childhood in a nutshell. 
V is for The Vagina Monologues. I haven’t read Eve Ensler’s Obie Award-winning play yet, but I intend to! 
W is for Thirteen Reasons Why we all feel hopeless at times; Jay Asher’s book helps me move past that feeling and see people for who they are. 
Z is for Z for Zachariah by Robert O’Brien. Identifying with a character who exists at the end of the world is strange but still, there it is. 
I know what you’re thinking, Ananda, where’s N, Q, U, X, and Y? 
Well, I’m not perfect, OK? I can’t think of everything. ♦

It’s astounding to me that I can feel all these things about people and they’ll not only never know, those feelings will never be returned. I am reminded of all the times my mother put out for me and I did nothing but take and take from her skein of rope. I am cackle-crying as I write this (Hysterical Woman trademark), and I know that my glasses will be stained when I am done. She won’t be here to clean them.
I watched the film Mommie Dearest for Mother’s Day, for the first time (three times), and even though it’s been called high camp, and a total defamation—both of which I agree with—I cannot help but sympathize with every woman’s breakdown that I see. (Isabelle Adjani’s depiction will always be the one I refer back to with the most ability to relate, and with the least disclaimers.) I’m in no way sympathizing with the film’s abuse, but I understand feeling that the tiniest misstep will expose everything that has been wrong up until that point.
I am sick, sick, sick. Always at the bottom of the barrel, reaching for the leech. I’m not good enough for myself. I don’t know if I ever will be. ♦

The only thing my coach says to me on senior night is “You’re starting at center back.” This isn’t news. All of the seniors start our last home game of the season—it’s tradition. He foregoes any words of tactical wisdom, holds onto his “good job” when he subs me out in the second half. I’m not counting his explanation of my only major defensive lapse in our post-game, post-loss huddle; I barely hear it, anyway, through a mantra in my head of, For the good of the team, for the good of the team, for the good of the team.
“That was my last chance,” I say to no one in particular as we break. I can finish the thought in any number of ways. To play forward again? To score a goal? To make a difference? 
One of my teammates gives the traditional speech in my honor, as a graduating senior. “You are so strong, and so comfortable in your own skin,” she says. “There aren’t many other players who could have suffered the injury you did last year, had surgery, and come back to play a full season in a position that you not only aren’t used to, but never wanted to play in the first place!”
And there it is, out in the open. She hugs me. Everyone hugs me. One of the freshmen cries when it’s her turn. Three different people tell me they wanted to be the one to give my speech. Maybe I have made a difference after all.
The next day at practice we end our scrimmage early and partner up to play a game, six or seven tiny teams all against each other shooting at one goal. For the first time all season I find myself in my element, timing my runs to meet my coach’s crosses and slamming headers off the frame of the goal, sprinting to catch a long ball and beating a defender on footwork and speed alone before slotting a shot through a dozen defenders from 20 yards. It feels good. And it’s fun. And my coach still doesn’t say anything, but I don’t need him to anymore. As long as my teammates trust me, I’ll play my best until the bitter end. ♦

The tunes that play on the strings of one’s heart vary—some make you happy, while others make you suffer. Some tunes steal your feelings all at once, rendering you unable to distinguish between the barrage of emotions.
The past week has been filled with work and activity. I prepared myself to take the German language exam, I took it and I did quite well, which brought me a happiness I’ve not felt in a long, long time. The test was like a challenge between me and my husband, and even though I am relatively new to the program, I scored better than him in the written exams. Although the oral exam scores have not yet been released, I think we received nearly the same score.
I’ve proved to him that I’m a girl who knows what she wants. I used to become jealous if I saw my husband talking to Swiss girls before I learned the language, but this was because I had no clue what they were saying. Now, after four months in Switzerland, I am able to communicate with those around me to a certain extent, even if I don’t understand every single word that they are saying.
I cannot explain how I communicate—it is a mix of hand gestures and some phrases and words. It’s not much, but it gives me a lot of confidence and diminishes my jealousy. Through my newly found maturity, I am able to silence all of those feelings, to hide them from my husband. You might laugh at me, and and maybe you won’t understand my viewpoint, but to tell the truth, those feelings have been my number one motivation to learn the language. 
That is how it has been, in terms of my academic life. When it comes to my health, I am doing quite well. Because I am carrying a baby, I have to visit the doctor regularly to make sure that everything is going well. A few days ago, the doctor showed me a picture of my baby, and I was torn apart with happiness when I heard the way my baby’s little heart was beating in perfect sync with my own. It was a sensation impossible to describe in any language—a truly magical feeling. To have a soul that is part of your soul, and a body that is part of your body, whose sleep is part of your sleep and whose food is part of your food…this is what pushes me to become responsible. I try to stay healthy and take my medication for his sake; I do so much for him and he is still in my womb. I wonder how it will be when he comes out. Maybe that is what motherhood is. I cannot believe that I was once a scared, shy girl, terrified of pregnancy and motherhood, when now I am so happy to simply see a picture of my baby, or hear his small heartbeat. Altogether, this experience has turned me into a calm and passionate person. Oh how sure my mother was when she said, “If you want to get rid of him, then do so after you have heard his first heartbeat.” 
She knew that this was going to happen because she knows what it is like to be a mother. I want him to come into my life so badly, I have already imagined what I want him to be like. I want him to be strong like my mother, and sweet like my husband. As for me—I do not know what I want him to inherit from me. I’m sure many of you are making fun of me, but I want to start creating that kingdom of happiness that I used to live in. I want to rebuild that kingdom, with the help of my husband.
I imagine that my friends would be surprised to learn that I am not that plain, exhausted, frightened little girl anymore. I am pregnant and will soon be a mother. I want to be known by my friends as the girl who regained life from the pregnancy that she once feared. Now I want the baby to arrive faster.
As a couple, our emotions are changing quickly, but there is always something dark deep down inside. It is very hard to get rid of that darkness because the human heart is complex, filled with emotions that change as quickly as the moments of time.
It seems as though I am returning to my old nature, and gaining more and more hope. It is very likely that I will become a woman who has survived a trauma that almost destroyed her. Yes, I think I just may have moved past that trauma, even though it scares me when I hear about home, and how it is getting worse and worse.
The bloodshed continues, regardless of the season. I am always thinking of my city. I want to do something to help, but I simply have no idea how or where to start. I trust that I will not stop sacrificing for my country, and will help out as much as I can after I have built a safe and happy home for myself. I chose my field of study because I knew my country needed it. I hope that I might be able to help anyone who has been harmed by this violence. I will not forget what my eyes saw during that war: those who lost limbs, those who suffered horrors, and those who lost lives. I will not let my happiness clear those images from my memory. ♦

It snuck past me, too, so don’t feel bad. In the past, when I didn’t say something, was not that I was afraid of what you might think, or that I was unsure, it was that I knew what you would think. But I didn’t know this time. This is the only time that I don’t know, and no amount of velvet pillows and cinnamon air can dissolve the discomfort that brings. 
She talks like an embroidered decorative pillow that was once your grandmother’s, whose fine needlework you have just begun to notice by looking at it intently for the first time. Her mind works more like a Costco display cake. Four years old and I thought I could walk over to the cake’s podium and swipe a frosting flower right off the top, it was just sitting there. I was four years old, and didn’t see the glass case. 
17 years old and I can see the glass case but I can’t crack it and I don’t know this time. The cake is always the cake. Duh. Is the icing even real? Can’t tell and never will: that glass case again. I can try.
I told her that an alarm goes off when my thighs touch. I explained that it was OK right now, since I was sitting on a couch. But not at other times. My hand seethed from pounding the case, but one of the frosting flowers dipped into the face of the cake. I can’t say I left knowing what she thought, but I was back in the world of knowing, scooting away from the cake. ♦

It’s getting to the end of the year and I’m really looking forward to summer. Usually teachers start to lighten up because why wouldn’t you?? Kids don’t see the point in working really hard when in a few weeks we’re not gonna be thinking about school at all. But my English teacher (who has always been super tough) is giving us so much work. He made us start a new book recently and he rushed us through it—it’s a 300-page book and he made us read it in three nights. And then right after that he assigned us five quotes each night to analyze. And me being me…I put everything off and didn’t read the book and I haven’t analyzed any of the quotes because I kept telling myself, “I’ll just do it later.” But I keep not doing it later! This is really gonna fuck me up because these quotes have a lot of value, they’re 100 points for each night and there have been maybe 10 nights of this homework. The due date is coming up really soon so I have to find out how I’m gonna get at least 1000 points of work done in probably 48 hours? 
I’m really pissed with myself. I ALWAYS say I’ll do better next time and I keep “trying” to do better and I’m not. I feel like maybe it’s not entirely my fault because I am getting tons of work pushed on me: On top of that work, my teacher expects us to read a short story, do a presentation of some analysis, have a full blown debate, and then write our own “moving short story” in less than 60 words. 
There are only four weeks left of school and all this week we have this new standardized testing. I’m starting to freak out now that I’m thinking about how much work I have to do. The only comforting thing is that in a couple of weeks I won’t have to think about it. But for now I’ll have to try to suck it up and finish my work the best I can. ♦

My sophomore year of college ended so much better than I thought it would. Maybe it’s my anxiety, but I was worried that I failed some of my classes, when in reality I got As in them. I have a really bad problem with rushing to the worst-case scenario. This was also my last time attending the school I hate so much as a communications major. I’m looking forward to studying film and creative writing at the school’s NYC campus. It’s much more diverse and I think I’ll be way more comfortable there. 
Even though the toxic atmosphere of my old campus largely contributed to my depression, there are a few things I’m going to miss about the small town where it was located. My friend, MK, introduced me to the Black Cow, a quaint coffee shop that makes chai lattes that taste like hugs. We’d meet there once a week to laugh over our drinks while discussing how ridiculous the world can be at times. MK radiates this sweet, otherworldly gentleness that would put me at ease when I was in the worst of moods. And her soft aura bleeds into her taste in local businesses. That coffee shop became a place of solace for me. Sometimes when I felt like school was getting to be too much I’d head to the Black Cow for that comforting chai latte, and admire the art on the walls until my anxiety vanished.
The best part of attending the crappiest school on the East Coast was having the privilege of meeting MK’s beautiful friends. They were all very similar to her and welcomed me with open arms. They basically gave me a tour of their rustic home, taking me to local art shows and watching local bands play in a neighbor’s basement became a staple in my weekly activities. I enjoyed hanging out with them so much that I went back to the town over the weekend for a party. I had a blast and made even more friends. 
Going back made me think about how specific places leave imprints on me, and vice versa. When you stay in a city for more than a month you begin to build a relationship with it. Certain street names get etched into your brain, you remember your favorite dish at that one restaurant, and the house of the person you had a short-lived crush on. As much I hate the educational institution situated there, I appreciated the town’s energy; it made my experience at school so much more bearable. I left a piece of myself in that town, it’s a part of me just like I’ve been part of it for the past year. I’m going to miss it. ♦

Sometimes little events stick in your mind and affect you deeply. Sometimes they become unforgettable.
I put my head on my pillow to get some sleep, and I began to cry because of what happened today—I was late for school and had to take a new bus line that I had never taken before. I wasn’t sure if it was the right bus, so I asked a man for help. He looked at me strangely, and walked away. I could not understand why he acted that way, but when I looked around me I realized that some of the people passing by were avoiding me and would even move away when I walked close to them.
Confused, I returned home and told my husband. He told me that these people saw that I was Arab and belonged to a different religion, and that some of them discriminated against foreigners. I was shocked by what he said. I could not imagine that in Switzerland, of all places, there were people who don’t appreciate freedom of religion or thought. I was deeply saddened that the way I look or dress could cause some people to avoid me, and that my appearance could turn me into a source of fear for them. I’d always thought that European countries were ideal, and that European people were mature, thoughtful, and open-minded. But I guess small-minded people are everywhere.
My husband blames their attitudes on the media, which he says plays a major role in spreading misunderstandings and stereotypes. The incident today hurt my dignity. It made feel that I was less than everyone else. I remembered how much blood has been shed in my country so that people might have a chance at living freely. I also remembered what my grandmother used to say, “He who leaves home, loses his dignity.” But if the only place I can keep my dignity is my homeland, then, in light of the current crisis, it is impossible for me to live with dignity.
I will not let this small incident affect me. I have faced many challenges in life, and I have learned to overcome them. I will try to forget what happened. I will remind myself that there are a few people that do not represent the majority. I will keep reminding myself of the many friends I have who belong to different ethnicities and religions, and how they all love and respect me, as I do them.
What matters is how we treat each other. Everything else, including belief and opinion, is a private matter. It seems to me that the younger generation in Europe is more flexible and accepting of foreigners than the older one. I have many friends with whom I spend time, and none of them are any different from my friends in Syria.
The only difference between women here and women there is their dreams. Most Syrian women, at least before the war, dream of a little home, a child and some work that might provide them with a little security. Here, however, most women do not have to worry about security because it is readily available. Their lives are generally easier and simpler, and they are not subjected to serious financial or social challenges. Girls here leave their parents’ house when they reach 18, while back home, a girl does not leave her parents’ house until she gets married. Some people think this shows lack of trust, but really it stems from respect and love. These are our traditions and I love and respect them because they strengthen family bonds, and, as you know, family means the world to me. All that I’ve been through, and all the changes in my new life, cannot make me forget about my family members, who are still waiting to receive the final decision about whether they can stay in Switzerland or whether they must go to Germany.
Europe and the Arab world are very different. Each of them has its own merits, though. There are many ideas in Europe that I wish the Arab world would adopt, and many ideas in the Arab world that I believe the Western world should consider. If these two societies collaborated more often, humanity might finally find a way to live in peace, stability, and security. But will this ever happen? Can the two worlds really unite? It seems impossible because those in power find it hard to compromise. The West has the upper hand right now, and I do not see it taking the weak into consideration. But I will store this dream away for another day. Who knows, maybe a miracle will happen. ♦

It is Ally Week at my school. A boy (who is white) comes over to the table where I am sitting with my two best friends (none of us are white), and starts yelling in the middle of the library. “If you have something to say to me, you know where to find me.” He is upset because we confronted him about his racism and hypocrisy as part of a public conversation online. For once, Ally Week has been about the school’s POC embracing their anger and their oppressors rather than faux joviality. “Kumbaya” is dead, but we didn’t kill it. The prejudice slinking unceremoniously through our corridors did. The trade of naivete for the realization of all the acts of bigotry around us was the hardest, but I cannot think of anything that was worth more. 
I cannot hear anything but my blood rushing through me for the next period. I am waiting. It seems like a small thing to be so angry about, someone yelling, but it is far more than that. It is the person in question, who has been nothing but awful and predatory to countless people in our school–including my friends. It is a matter of him exerting his privilege by pretending to be an ally in conversations and then turning around and saying the n-word or denouncing the work of women of color. It is a matter of him denying that he does anything wrong and then trying to intimidate WOC by shouting at them in public. He is an amalgamation of all the middle school racists I dreamed of leaving behind. The boy is in the next room, and I am certain that he can feel my rising body heat through the layers of insulation. “You look like someone pissed you off,” a friend says. I give her a slow smile and eye the clock, Glance number five. 
The minute before class lets out I see my best friends through the small pane of the door and rush out. They have been waiting, too. He doesn’t come our way when he exits so my friend Danielle calls his name. He turns, smirks, and keeps walking. “Elliot!” I scream. “Elliot Blumenfeld!*” He is talking to his friend. People are turning around. I continue. I berate him for his racism, for his inability to properly confront us, for his general lack of decency. One of my friends walks away but I do not stop until I am done. 
It isn’t over. This is just the beginning. I’m not depending on the visage of change anymore—because my life depends on it. ♦

I will be 14 tomorrow. I feel excited but slightly anxious. The thing I hate about my birthday is the expectation that I’ll change in some way. In actuality, I’m the same person with a different age. I’m listening to N.E.R.D right now. I like giving certain moments soundtracks so that when I go back to that memory in my head, I mix it with the songs I was listening to at the time. I’m wearing my evil eye bracelet to keep the evil spirits away and to resist all negative energy that could come my way. Tomorrow is going to be a good day, I can feel it.

It’s my birthday and I’ve had a pretty great weekend. I watched Austin Powers 3 and listened to the Justified album for the millionth time. I’m looking forward to my family taking me more seriously now that I’m getting older. I feel like age is a really weird thing; time doesn’t stop and we keep getting older as the seconds pass. One day, the never-ending weeks of school and the time I spend watching films on the weekends will be over. I know I’ll die one day, because everyone dies, but I feel like it’s really weird that I can be alive one day and dead the next. I also realize that it’s slightly abnormal for a 14-year-old to think such morbid thoughts on her birthday, so I’m going to stop overthinking things and accept that I’m getting older. Maybe watching episodes of Seinfeld will help me on this journey toward my death. ♦

Make me better. Paint my fingernails and toes, and cut off the parts of my cuticles that always fray. Scrub away my calluses and my cracked heels, and pluck the single brown hair growing from my big toe that no one notices until I point it out.
Straighten my hair so you can’t tell there was ever a single kink in it. Put so much product in it so that nothing—not sun, rain, wind—can ruin its sleekness. Make sure it doesn’t smell burnt. The last thing I want is to smell burnt.
Whiten my teeth so they hurt and my gums bleed. Extract gunk from the pores of my face and fill the little holes with false promises and self-confidence dependent upon the validation of others. Dry out my T-zone with any chemical that does the trick. If my eyes get puffy, cover them with cold spoons.
Tape my breasts up and into perfect mid-sized dollops of fat and femininity. Put the best jewelry around my neck and my fingers and through my earlobes.
Force me into heels and teach me how to walk in them correctly.
Tell me I’m pretty. Tell me I’m the prettiest.
I don’t like this part of prom. ♦

They call my name, and I don’t trip on my gown, and 11 seconds later high school is over.
My best friend shows up with a gift—a fancy journal and pen, she says, to record all of the new memories I make in college. Once I get home I read the inscription she left on the first page and it’s the only thing that makes me cry all day. I start writing in it right then and there. Here is part of what I wrote.
I guess it still hasn’t sunk in that it’s OVER, for good, all caps, that’s it, forever! The flowers on the mantle and diploma on the shelf might say otherwise, but part of me still believes that I’ll get up bright & early tomorrow and ship myself off to class as usual. Or, if not that, I’ll be back in the same old building come August, with the same people I’ve come to know and all the friends I’ve loved dearly over the past five years.
Because my friends are all such beautiful people, and I don’t know what great thing I did in some past life to deserve them, but whatever it was, it must have been huge. And sometimes that hugeness is daunting, and depressing, and I feel as though I don’t deserve them. And that is hard. I have been sadder this past year than in all my previous years combined.
But I cannot be sad today.
Later, I pick up my yearbook and everyone tells me how much they’ll miss me. They promise to keep in touch, even though that’s never a guarantee; this may be the last time I’ll ever see a few of these people. But that’s OK, too. There will be new places, and new people, and new friends. These things happen. Those who really care will find a way to continue doing so.
And I see that immediately. One of my closest friends says, “Let’s get brunch tomorrow,” and another says, “Finally, we can catch up on all those shows we’ve been talking about!” We are reaching a time in which staying a part of each other’s lives is going to require actual effort. We don’t have eight hours a day crammed into one building to keep us together by sheer commiseration. To see that effort so soon is meaningful in itself.
To sum it up, here is the difference I am trying to portray. Looking through the notes people left in my yearbook, two stand out, right next to each other. The first: “It was a great five years.” The second: “This is not goodbye!”
And on a first read, the first might make me sad. But I cannot be sad today. ♦

I am behind on everything. The to-do list in my mind is so comically long that I’ve stopped transcribing it out of fear. I finally start writing again, my first real script. I show my friend my ideas and a few days later she shows me her own work, littered with phrases and concepts from what I had done. I decide to stop talking. 
Women Who Run With Wolves tells me to learn from the “dark man dreams” I have been having, where there are so many antagonists sometimes, that it seems as if we are all going to run out of air. Clarissa Pinkola Estés says, “The threat of the dark man serves as a warning to all of us—if you don’t pay attention to the treasures, they will be stolen from you. In this manner, when a woman has one or a series of these dreams, it infers that a huge gate is opening to the initiatory grounds where her revaluing of her gifts can occur.” She goes on to talk about cleansing one’s life of negativity, which is such a mundane task that I forget how important it is until something as terrifying as my dream actors chasing me for burial jolts me back into what my mother called “my right mind.” I fill up the back of a new notebook with poems but none of them are good enough. Everyone has always told me that I am too hard on myself, but it is a matter of recognizing my best and accepting nothing less.
We have less than seven days left of school and it seems as if everything is coming down on me. I have not righted myself yet, or at least, not enough. The thought of being this off-balance hurts, a little pang in my heart to keep me moving. I am always tired. ♦

I had a really insightful conversation with this girl in my math class. At first, I felt and acted extremely awkward because she is quite popular, and I get really nervous around people who intimidate me. But I relaxed after a while; she turned out to be really cool. We started talking about our school and how none of the boys have nice hair and then moved on to a topic that I’m extremely interested in: parties. When it comes to parties, I’m like a spy who is forced to watch from afar. I’ve never been invited to one nor have I ever heard what happens at these occasions. I figured that the host maybe lost my invite, or that I wasn’t in school the day she gave them out, but it turns out that I just was never invited.
As the conversation moved on, she began talking about what happens at these parties, which is apparently lots of drinking and smoking weed, kissing, and sex. It sounded like my worst nightmare, but she seemed so nonchalant about it. She said that people start kissing random people they don’t know and everything is really wild, then reassured me that she didn’t want to have sex until she was ready. I was surprised that people my age are doing things like this. For all I knew, average 14-year-olds stayed at home and watched movies. Apparently that’s just me. 
We talked about the different social groups in school and she said that being “popular” isn’t as glamorous as it seems. Now I feel really shallow for underestimating popular students just because of where they stand in my school’s social hierarchy. That said, I still wonder why different social groups are even a thing in school. 
In fact, our interaction is a prime example of why staying in certain groups is stupid. Our interesting conversation wouldn’t have happened outside of class due to this strict rule that only pretty people hang out with each other and all the weird people should go away. I’m sick of this being a thing that people at my school still believe in. I have come to a conclusion that labelling social groups in schools ruins our confidence and makes us compare ourselves to others. 
It felt cool to enter the popular world without having to leave the math classroom I was in, but it pains my heart to know that if this girl sees me while she’s with her group of friends, she won’t speak to me, only smile to signal that we notice each other’s existence. It’s like we’re two separate worlds that only intersect on special occasions. ♦

I haven’t been feeling my best this week. I’ve had big “this determines what schools you’re going to be eligible for” tests every day at school, and when I get home I sat on my bed and worried about them all. From this entry, and some of my previous diaries, too, you can probably tell I’m not a huge fan of standardized tests. 
One thing I AM a huge fan of is videos about wisdom tooth removal. Countless Instagram pages and YouTube compilations show the hilarious after effects that whatever medicine they use to put you to sleep has after you wake up. These videos have been keeping me calm.
My grandma often tells me the story of my uncle freely expressing his love for everyone at the orthodontist the day his teeth were removed, and then trying to jump out of the car at the drive-through at a fast food place. It makes me think about what I might be like after having my wisdom teeth removed. I’ve seen videos of people letting out their secrets in front of their parents while still a bit loopy. Umm…yikes?! 
Admittedly I’m not one for breaking the rules—when I do I always get caught—but now I feel like I have a new question to ask myself when I’m feeling rebellious: “Is this something you want dad to find out while you’re under the influence of laughing gas?” ♦

I love my brother with all of my heart but I feel so distant from him. His name is Mustafa, but I’ve always called him Musti. He’s too cool, with his tattoos and piercings, living in the city, staying in his dream-like apartment with his girlfriend who is really kind. 
He’s always been the example of the family. If I show any signs of negativity toward my education, my mum tells me to be more like my brother. He is loved dearly by my parents because he’s always been extravagant and different, ever since he was a kid. I discovered what kind of music he was into when he was a teen because I was going through a wardrobe and found his old System of a Down CD. 
We’re 12 years apart—he’s 26, I’m 14. I don’t have many memories of living with him and that makes me sad. When we’re together, we talk like we’re old friends, but we don’t have the same bond that he has with my older sister. Sometimes I feel left out, as if I don’t really have a brother. At times, I’m desperate for his company, crying to myself when I review my school day in my head. I wish he was here to comfort me and make me laugh when I’m feeling depressed. If my family was Malcolm in the Middle, he’s Francis. He’s the cooler older brother that I’ve always wanted, but I never really get to see him.
I miss him a lot. ♦

To the boy I once kissed at that concert,
Is it because I was the closest girl to you? Probably. But for the sake of this outpouring of my innermost emotions, let’s pretend you chose me from the sea of sweaty teen girls.
First, did you see my face before we began? Did you like it? I was scared to look at your face because you were behind me and I thought you might be ugly. (You weren’t, congratulations.)
Could you tell that my hair was straightened? Could you imagine it curly? Which way did you prefer? What color were my eyes? Did you look? Was makeup running down my face? You were sweaty. So was I.
You are random and nameless and completely unattached to me. I like that. I’ll never be afraid to do something stupid in front of you, or fumble in front of you, or cry in front of you. I’ll never see you again. You won’t tell your friends anything about me, good or bad, because you’ve forgotten me. In fact, I only think about you because when I get pensive my memories are acute.
Thanks for 10 minutes of attention during the concert and an hour of attention after the concert. (My friends really grilled me about you.) Sometimes you just need a little something to validate your self-esteem. Can you now tell mine is shit? Did you know then? Is that why you chose me? ♦

I was really excited to go to L.A. I’ve been wanting to go for a long time, and it’s been a couple of years since I’ve been. I wasn’t sure if we would go because of what happened last week, and especially because my dad is the parent in charge of this trip. 
As I mentioned, my parents have been trying this thing where they take away my phone, which has mostly just been fucking up the rest of my life instead of teaching me discipline or responsibility. Anyways, we left for L.A. and it seemed fine: My dad even gave me my phone for the weekend. Since I was hoping for a good trip, I tried my best to make sure it would be good, but everything blew up in my face—really fast. 
One minute I was eating a really delicious breakfast, and the next my dad had me slammed up against a wall for asking him to not be pissy so that the trip wouldn’t be ruined. Well, it was ruined by that. So now we’re here and I haven’t been able to do anything that I want, although my mom convinced him after the fight to let me and my sister go to LACMA. I guess on the bright side, I got a really cool book at the museum. It’s more like a journal, and it’s to help me organize my thoughts, to some extent. It’s called Connect the Thoughts. There wasn’t anything else good about the trip, though. My dad confiscated my phone again, and made us stay at the hotel for the rest of the day (it was the afternoon when the incident happened), and found a flight for us to leave early. 
Knowing that my dad would hurt me is kinda a wake up call. He’s done it before, but I’ve never seen him look like that before. Or maybe he has and I just hadn’t noticed. I’m not sure. I’m just scared to be around him. And I want my mom to have full custody of me, because it’s just not safe here anymore. ♦

1. I forget that I have to turn in a proposal for my cultural history research paper in two days. I’ve had my topic for months, but my cursor winks malevolently at me from an empty page, dim and chilling on my laptop screen. My phone is turned off and an extension on my browser blacklists any websites that might distract me and I tell myself, Concentrate, concentrate! But it doesn’t come. I start putting together sources instead. The proposal isn’t worth that much of my grade. I’ll write it tomorrow.
2. I catch myself grinding my teeth. It’s rare. Sometimes I’ll wake up with my jaw clenched and it actually takes a moment to ease out of it. For some reason it won’t be sore later, but the rest of me will be, no matter how little our coach makes us run at soccer practice.
3. We’ve won two games and lost one. Scored 10 goals and conceded nine; not the best average. But we are exhausted and no one knows why. At the end of practice one day, our coach stops us mid-scrimmage and we all fall over each other, the cold air twists tight around our lungs. “Get on the line,” he says. We haven’t been satisfactory. I sprint faster than I have all week, chest heaving, stomach full of misdirected anger. I can’t tell if it’s at him or at myself or at all of us or at no one, but I don’t care, not as long as it keeps my heart beating and my legs working.
4. I pass a Calculus test. I sit in the corner and write furiously while the rest of my class retakes it.
5. I count the days on my fingers. Graduation is on a Sunday, but us seniors will hardly be at school the previous week. Our class officers send out information about the annual senior trip and one of my friends texts me, “Are you going?” I’m not. But I wasn’t expecting anyone to care if I was. I reconsider. My parents offer to split the cost. It’s a good deal, they say. You’ll earn plenty working this summer.
6. Over spring break I went kitesurfing. Kites I am decent with; surfing I am not. The instructor complimented the smoothness of my flights and then laughed when I wiped out repeatedly on the board. But it wasn’t cruel. I laughed along, self-deprecating, raring to try again. Eventually the wind died. We took the jet ski back to shore. I was peeling myself out of my wetsuit when my mom said, “Are you bleeding?” I’d lost all the skin off my knuckles and a horrendous red bruise was in full, colorful bloom on my right knee. But I was still laughing, raking a hand through my salty hair. “I’m fine,” I told her.
7. Sometimes it is still hard to focus, and sometimes I look in the mirror and it takes me a moment to recognize the person looking back at me. I meet their eyes and I am confused for a split second—and then it passes. I have the whole summer, I tell myself. Months to figure out who I am and who I’m going to be. Next year will be a fresh start, if I make it one. ♦

Every show or film or song that I listen to is about the hardships that friends go through, or the fun that they have when they hang out at the mall. I can’t relate. The combination of being 13 and also having super overprotective parents means that I’m not allowed to go out by myself. So, the only interactions I have with people my age are at school and, unluckily, I have no friends there. I’m always the subject of laughter at school for some reason. I really long for a friend. I can imagine drinking smoothies in the shopping centre, or playing basketball in the park with a group of companions. But I guess I’ll never know how it feels. 
All I do is read, watch films, and listen to music. And although that sounds really fun, I feel lonely. Sometimes, I just want to cry. I’m dreading the first day back after Easter break because I have no one to talk to. I don’t even talk at school, which explains why people always look at me like I’m a demented ghost who has been haunting the science block since 1990 when she accidentally was killed in an explosion. (That sounds like an episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark that I watched recently). I’m honestly not like that at all. I’m just too shy to start a conversation. I wish someone would talk to me who’s not my mum, dad, sister, or my dog. I feel like such a loser.
But when I really think about it, my teenhood will end one day and I’ll be an adult and none of this will bother me anymore. I dream of the day when I can wear what I want, go where I want to go and when I don’t have to ask my Mum if I can dye my hair or not. If anything, I feel worse about being a girl because I feel nervous going places by myself and I can’t wear shorts that fall above my knees. But now I’m prioritizing my first world problems: How can I be so selfish when there are innocent people dying from poverty and war. I can’t believe how self-centred I can be. 
Maybe having friends isn’t that important. I think I prefer sitting in my room, listening to my Frank Sinatra cassette. ♦

When I was 13, I had a notebook. On the front cover, I wrote “THIS IS A NOTEBOOK”—I thought it was very ironic. I wrote a poem in the notebook. It went like this:
The way he laughs, his crooked teeth. I love him but he doesn’t love me.
His Franco smile, he’s such a bad liar; he can’t admit the truth.
He loves her, without a clue.
His Khaki pants, his tacky jokes, he’s quite a caring little bloke.
He cares about me, but only a bit. With her, it’s different.
She always has him, he’s nice and he’s kind. So hard to find.
He doesn’t see it, neither does she. “We’re just friends,” that’s what he says.
I know how I feel. I know this won’t change.
Maybe he is just a name, a face, a person, someone strange.
We will never happen, and I’m not ashamed.
After all, there’s always James. 
When I wrote this poem, I loved one boy a lot. It’s likely that the only person I’ve loved more than this boy was James Franco himself.
I don’t love this boy anymore. I don’t think I love any boy anymore. But I’m still very jealous. I still feel uniquely alone. ♦

In most cases, the body hosts disease for a long time before the symptoms begin to show. It seems that what I experienced back in Syria was similar—the symptoms developed only after I left.
The most difficult symptom is the mood swings: I go from extreme elation to extreme sadness, seemingly at the drop of a hat. Sometimes I even amaze myself—I don’t understand all of the emotions that are housed inside my body. What scares me is that there is a new life growing within this sick soul of mine.
Only two months after getting married, I discovered that I was pregnant. A little human being with a heart and a soul is growing inside of me. I did not mean to get pregnant—it just happened. How should I feel? Should I be happy? Should I be sad? I don’t know.
My reaction to the news was very strange, and it hurt my husband, who could not comprehend what was going on inside of me.
I was so exhausted by the move to our new apartment that I fainted, and they rushed me to the doctor. When I opened my eyes, I saw my husband standing next to me, with a big smile on his face, happiness nearly gushing out of his eyes.
He told me, his voice trembling, that I was going to have a baby and that he was going to be a father in a few months. There was love, care and appreciation in his voice, as if I had just given him the most precious gift in the world, but my reaction destroyed his happy world. I was stressed. I began to scream that I didn’t want the baby. I literally shattered his happiness, which I fear is becoming a special skill of mine. What is happening to me?
He was silent until we arrived back home, and then he asked me about the reason behind my extreme reaction. Was it because I didn’t want his baby? Was it because I was scared? Was it because I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life with him?
I couldn’t answer because I didn’t have any convincing reason to give him, or maybe I was just too embarrassed to tell him the reason. What do I say to him? Do I tell him that I don’t think that I’m qualified to raise a baby? Do I tell him that I cannot carry such responsibility? Do I tell him that I’m afraid that after all of the oppression I suffered, I might become a tyrant with our child? I blanketed myself in silence. I was stressed out for three days, but then I turned to my mother. I told her how I was afraid that the curse of war might follow my child. She laughed and said, “Wait until you feel him moving inside of you, and then come talk to me.”
In some moments, I just want to get rid of the baby, and be done with everything, but I stop myself because I know that this decision is not mine alone to make. Other times, I look at my body and I imagine how it will change, and I wonder about the movement inside of me that my mom mentioned. I do want to experience it. I do want to be a mother, but I’m afraid that I won’t live up to that title.
However, when I see the flowers blooming in our neighborhood, I tell myself that there is beauty with everything that is newly born, and spring is how the world is reborn every year. I tell myself that this new baby might mean a whole new life and a whole new beginning for me, but soon that other feeling returns, and the past, present and future become dark. I don’t know if anyone can understand—I feel imprisoned, and the walls are closing in on me. I am suffocating. How weak I feel!
I hate being weak, and I always do my best to survive, but this time, it’s too much for me. I can’t tell my husband all of this. I know that he wants to become a father. This is his right, and it’s not my place to take it away from him. I can’t do this to him. I can’t do this to my baby. And I can’t do this to myself.
But what if I fail as a mother? I realize how important a mother’s role is, and I also realize how much mothers sacrifice, and I do not know if I am capable of such giving. I am tired. Not knowing what decision to make hurts. Not knowing what I want hurts even more. This is where I am. I no longer suffer from the bombs and bullets, but from the fears and illusions that my body now hosts. I call them illusions because I’m trying to deny that they are real.
The only solution I see is to ignore these feelings, and hope that they die from neglect. I truly want to have a baby and raise him to become a strong person, but…I don’t know what’s going to happen. I truly don’t. ♦

I feel uncomfortable posting in certain groups on Facebook and other social media at the moment. There is a lot of discrimination toward un- and underrepresented groups, and irritation toward people who are not in those groups and who act in oppressive ways by taking up space in online discussions. 
I don’t always know where I stand or how much privilege I have, because I don’t entirely know my identity—I’m at the intersection of so many. I’m mixed race, but because I’m white passing, I don’t feel like a person of color. Is it correct for me to claim that title? I have a non-binary gender identity, but I’m also a femme AFAB (assigned female at birth), which gives me privilege when standing alongside other non-binary and trans folk.
I feel a bit stuck, a bit disconnected from a community of people that originally saved me. I’m often told that as a queer, mixed race, mentally ill woman I should take up as much space as I want and need to. But I’m also told that I shouldn’t take up as much space as I do because—due to my privilege as a white passing, middle-class, able-bodied person—I’m silencing those who need to be heard. 
I’m not sure what I’m meant to do. ♦

I have this idea for a painting. It came to me on a not-great night, but that’s generally how things happen. It’s a thigh, with the curvy part being removed. It’s not gory or even bloody: It’s like a Salvador Dali painting in the way that this major event is happening, but the world around it is like, “lol chill, it no big.” The knife hovers between the newly butchered leg and the “extra” cut away. The background is a light-ish indio blue, and the color scheme is blue and orange complementary. It looks great.
I tried to paint it today but I couldn’t bear to look at it. To give myself some slack, the leg as I imagined it is at the toughest possible angle—looking at it from the front but to some degree from the side. But what does slack matter when you simply can’t portray the image that says what you can’t? It was so one-dimensional that I couldn’t even comprehend what it was. I wiped it off with a makeup wipe because fucking oil can’t just be painted over with gesso. It now resembles a tan tree trunk with a nubby branch. Accurate.
I have spent two hours trying to calm the uprising inside me. I almost didn’t paint anything today because I was afraid that I would feel exactly like this. But I painted anyways. I’ll be proud of myself today for painting anyways. ♦

Power interruptions have plagued our region for a while now, but it’s only recently that these little annoyances have got into my nerves. See, these power interruptions happen at random. Sometimes there are nights when the lights go out at a specific time, and this goes on for two, three consecutive days, urging me to think they’ve already scheduled the power outages. But no, these power interruptions are out to get me.
During these times, the only thing to hear is the beating of my heart, and loneliness is my only friend. It’s inescapable, which is why maybe I hate it. Other times, I go out to run at a nearby park, just to take my mind off my body, even for a while. To not think of anything besides muscles straining and lungs heaving to keep up, keep up, keep up with my mind’s willingness to push through the next curve, and the next. Until I reach a mindlessness, a space in my psyche where I can exist and breathe, exist and breathe, exist and breathe—nothing more or less.
This perpetual loneliness is haunting—although it may sometimes manifest itself as a curse, I hold it as a talisman, sacred. Right here, in this solitary space, I declare it holy. ♦

I completely failed at my version of self-care last week. I was having crying fits and anxiety attacks all through the night and was frustrated with not being able to sleep. I had a 10:35 class in the morning, which I am always late for, so at 6:30 AM, I accepted that there was no way I was going to fall asleep. I planned to used the extra three hours to shower, wash my hair, do yoga, and catch up on homework. That will definitely put my mind at ease, I thought to myself. I was so motivated, I got up ran to my hair care basket, and saw that I left my combs at home, How could I be so stupid? I had another self-hate episode on how I’m the stupidest person on earth who can’t function as a productive human being. I can’t even remember to bring hair essentials back to school after spring break? My lip trembled with disappointment. 
After giving myself a mental beating, I opted to detangle my hair with my fingers while I washed and conditioned it. I didn’t wanna give up. I had a fantasy of being able to tell myself that I was productive before noon for the first time in months. By the time I was done in the shower I decided I was still way too tired from not sleeping, so I hopped back in bed, and set an alarm for 9:30 AM, leaving me enough time to do yoga and study. Only problem was I slept through the alarm and I woke up at 10:25 AM, making me late for class again. I was irate and anxious, and telling myself I was worthless and wasn’t gonna amount to anything if I can’t even wake up on time. It was the end of the world, I felt like a failure. I got lucky and arrived just two minutes late. My professor had also just walked in, and marked me present.
Class wasn’t too hard. When it finished, I approached my professor to discuss areas I needed to work on. I had been doing better than I thought I would on tests, yet I struggled with the homework. She told me it was fine, and that I could come to her for extra help whenever. This was the opposite of how I thought she’d react. For months I dreaded asking her about extra help, thinking it would result in her being angry with me. This prompted me to take a look at how my anxiety affects my everyday activities, it keeps me from being able to rationalize between a life a or death situation and me just being forgetful or a bit scattered like every other person. In reality it was fine, and she was truly understanding. 
My anxiety keeps me up at night and tells me not to leave bed in the morning. It’s a miniscule, mind-crippling monster made from pencil scribblings, with wild hair and yellow eyes, that screams inside me—from the very bottom of my body so by the time it reaches my brain it is just a whisper—telling me that my life is still a despicable mess and I’ll never amount to anything, so I should just lay down and pretend to be dead, because I’ll probably just screw it up even more by trying to accomplish anything. 
Describing it now, I can’t believe that I walk around with this ghastly, horrifying feeling. I saw anxiety as a flaw that inconvenienced everyone else but me, not something I should look at and take care of with kindness and care. Whenever I got angsty or overwhelmed growing up, my family would just get annoyed and tell me to calm down. It wasn’t a mental illness to the adults around me, just Thahabu “being extra and overthinking everything.” I talked to my therapist about the episode I had, and she pointed out that I always go to the worst-case scenario, and that I’m way too hard on myself. “Instead of saying you’re stupid, try saying you’re sad, because that’s what’s really going on,” she said. She was right, I don’t give myself the time or space to be sad, and replacing “stupid” and “incompetent” with “wow, I’m going through a lot, of course I’m worried and sad,” did make me feel like less of a problem. 
I am slowly accepting that my anxiety is real. Although I had a terrible time trying to make myself feel better that morning, I still set a goal of waking up at 9 AM every day to do yoga and other activities that make me feel good. I love the feeling of being up while everyone else is asleep. Using the time to read is the best; because sometimes depression can make you lose interest in the things that you once loved. I haven’t been able to finish a book in a year but this weekend I got lost in The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan. 
I haven’t quite stuck to the 9 AM rule yet, but maybe it’s not supposed to happen all at once. Maybe it is waking up before 12 PM, and knowing that I’m making the effort to get up and make myself happy. That’s progress. I’m building the desire to do things, and reminding myself that these things do make me happy. I’m having to reconstruct myself: put all of the shattered parts of me back together and get to know them again. It feels so good to indulge in things that I thought had dried up and fallen off me like leaves from a tree in Fall. I know that spring is around the corner and the leaves always grow back. ♦

A reworked version of the Bee Gees’ song “Massachusetts.” 
Feel I’m going back to Massachusetts,
Something’s telling me I must go tour.
And the wifi is weak in Massachusetts,
The signal booster I left sitting at home.
Tried to stay my ass in New Jersey,
Would rather spend some time with my friends.
But the colleges are all in Massachusetts,
And Daddy brought me here to see my future.
Talk about the res life in Massachusetts,
Ask about the scores that I will not get.
And my heart was nearly destroyed by Massachusetts,
And Massachusetts is one place I’ve toured.
I will remember Massachusetts. ♦

I wish I had pictures of every single one of the scabs I picked as a small girl so I could put it on this shirt. I can see all of them on a rotating rack—me on my bed, on the polka dots, wiping blood on the wall. Me inching my stubby fingertips underneath a barely raised crust and holding my breath as I heard that slight snap of skin ripping. You really had to listen for it, and I liked that the most. I used to train my ears to do a lot. 
Sundays in my old apartment had a certain ugliness that made me cry when I woke up. One Sunday, I had a dream that the world ended and I woke up and remembered that my mother was alive and clung to her until she got annoyed. Last January, I woke up from a dream where she had died and I woke up looking for her comfort and remembered something different. I didn’t go to school that day. 
I told someone that I was the last Oracle of Delphi and they said that I was probably the first because it was all bullshit. What is there left to say when all of your intrusive thoughts come true? I panicked one night and couldn’t fall asleep so I crawled over my mom and locked myself in the bathroom and bawled and PLEADED SO HARD out loud with God—for 20 minutes straight—not to take her away from me, not to let her die, please God I’m so sorry anything but her. I prayed in my mind, too, in case my voice was a transgression. This was years before cancer. That’s how I know. 
She came to the door and asked me if I was OK. If I could swallow up her voice now and hold it in my mouth like a bullfrog I would never talk again. The glow through my skin would be enough. 
My favorite scar, left leg, is gone. It was from my favorite park in Prospect Heights. There are others but I don’t remember their moments. My favorite scar on another person, left hand, is gone. It was from my best source. ♦

I want to believe. I want to believe that good days far outnumber the bad. I want to believe that people are softer, gentler, kinder than what I make them out to be in my head. I want to believe that everything’s going to be OK, if I only let things run their natural course. I want to believe that I can take on the world, one breath at a time.
I got good quality trousers at a thrift market last Wednesday. The act of going outside to do something lightens me, and fills me with gratitude. The past few days have been rough, what with the looming certainty of going back to college in two months!!! I’ve also been loading up on caffeine, which is a bit anxiety-inducing, and terrifying because the comedown is not good. Somehow, I always think and feel that I’m dying.
I’m also engaged in a truckload of trying this week:

To eat on time and hydrate more. My care-savvy self wants me to “get back on track” or “keep up” with the coming stressors that college will bring. EEEEP.
To be thankful for things that I usually just ignore.
To not forget my multivitamins, but also to not be overly anxious about it to the point of imbibing twice the recommended daily intake.
To formulate a study routine, or a general routine, that will suit my needs when I’m finally back, hustlin’ at school.
To be patient with algebra, a subject I’m still stuck on, and a loser chicken in.
To control my head, this madness throbbing stealthily inside, while also trying not to suppress my angst and unusual grouchiness.
To place my feet firmly on the ground. To make decisions for myself—small decisions, big decisions, consequential decisions—and be accountable and own up to them.
Since the university I’m enrolling in is a bit more expensive than the university I used to attend, I’m trying to be brave and self-sufficient enough to face cranky adults in government offices, so that I can score educational aid. It’s stressful but, surprisingly, I have the strength now to power through.
Trying to lessen my vanity and recycle old eyeshadow palettes, and use what I have. to save money for when I truly need it. Somehow I still feel like splurging on a face mask, the peeling skincare stuff Arabelle Sicardi recommended, and a fire foundation. Damn, beauty is frickin’ terror. ♦

Sometime in the next two weeks I will finally decide where I’m going to spend the next four years of my life.
I’ve been thinking about where I’m going so much that I’m neglecting where I am right now. An English paper sits unfinished in an open tab in my browser, but another tab holds a sample schedule I constructed—should I end up at my top choice school—neatly laid out in a spreadsheet, detailed with class times and lab hours and notes like “Spanish or Russian?” and “replace with ASTR 113 if I test out of calc.” Laying it all out like that makes the future seem very real but at the same time not real enough, because I still have all of these other responsibilities weighing on my shoulders for the next month or so. I’m not at a point yet where I can just say “screw it” to my next soccer game or calculus test. Or English paper.
I visit that same school of my timetable dreams, do my first overnight on campus. The math professor I meet with is delighted to recommend his department’s data science minor to complement an astronomy major, and is overjoyed to discover that I have surpassed the school’s three-semester calculus curriculum. “You’ve already covered vector calculus?” he demands. I nod. “Sequences and series?” Another nod. “I’ll have to get you in touch with the chair of the department. This could open up a slot for you to take my statistical modeling class,” he hints. His last name is the same as my birthstone. Maybe it’s fate.
I get an extension on the English paper.
The National Women’s Soccer League kicks off its fourth season, marking the first time that a women’s professional organization has lasted more than three years in the U.S. While I’m on my college visit, my own soccer team takes a bus two hours out of town to beat some poor team 11-0.
“Senior night is May, 5!” someone says cheerfully. And everything will go from there: prom, our senior trip, graduation. Maybe it’ll finally be real enough when I can throw my cap in the air and say I’m done, done for good, done with this school and this town and this final crushing month. ♦

Anne Carson talks about the gender of sound: I am blahblahblah and WOULD YOU BE QUIET ALREADY and banshee wailing in the fifth floor girls’ bathroom. I limit myself to the second and third floors for today, and already I am relieved of the sin of small talk. No one can ignore me now. I’ve all but perfected the art of not being trampled. 
I leave Spanish class to cry about my mom and write about her beloved tulips and St. Michael necklace and the plant of mine she watered for almost a decade. I can’t feel her presence in the 79 degree weather but I know that she is not cold wind but fresh air. This is all her. I have to learn to recognize her without the car crash scar and the baby lotion scent. 
In my family, we don’t die. My mother has no headstone. Sometimes I think that I’ll open up her ashes and see nothing because this has all been a hoax and she is somewhere in San Fernando becoming one with her mother’s country dirt. I don’t know what I’ll do if I can’t meet her family this summer. It is my last one before I am an adult. I can’t be, I can’t be an adult already. The movement of years makes no sense to me. She would have been 50 when I was 18. My favorite of the soiled milestones. 
I am saving up to see them but I haven’t told my father’s side (my caretakers) yet because I hate when logic ruins my plans. I believe in the wildest. If I didn’t I would drop too quickly—the weight of reality would be too much. I know I can do it. She’s watching me. ♦

I’m a sad potato.
You know that feeling you get in the morning, when you wake up and realize you have to get out of bed and go to school or work? You have to do that thing called living. And you’re so tired but you manage to bundle up what seems like all your energy to get out of bed and take a shower and do the thing expected of you.
Now imagine feeling that constantly, ten times worse, every time you move or speak, every time you make a minor decision. That’s depression, for me—at least part of it.
Then there’s this looming sense of sharpness and panic, which is the anxiety, occasionally spiking when you have to do something under pressure or unplanned. That feeling you get before a first date or a presentation, an interview, something where you feel vulnerable: It’s that feeling following you around, constantly. ♦

The following is a “goodbye letter” to my mom that I wrote as part of the Every 15 Minutes program held at my high school, and many others, to promote awareness of drinking and driving. Around 40 of the 3,800 kids at my school were chosen to be part of the program, and my participation signified a teenager that had died in a drug- or alcohol-related car accident. After staging a live car accident—complete with ambulances, a helicopter, and the jaws of life—we 40 took trips to the county jail and morgue, then went to stay the night at a hotel, where we were cut off from the outside world completely, to represent our absence from the world as victims of this horrendous crime. It was there, after hearing graphic story after graphic story from now-graying and forever grieving parents who had lost their kids to drunk driving, that we wrote these letters.
***
Dear Mom,
I can’t express to you what things will be like now that I am gone, or even how I want them to be, specifically. Well, I would like a legacy. Maybe you can try to publish my writing and exhibit my art? I can’t say what life will mean for you now, and I can’t understand the difference, but I’ll try to understand it by pretending that I’m losing you.
Lying on my bed with you or sitting next to you in the car after school is what I dream about. When my mind was a hell, that’s all that I wanted. I could feel every emotion and every sadness during that time, but the realization that this sickness was pulling me from your arms was generally the only thought that would draw tears down my sweaty cheeks. I wanted to be back with you.
“I want my girl back.” Words I will never forget. 
I want to be back, too.
I’m glad that I came back for a little while before I had to go forever. Although I was often in pain while those times were happening, I’m able to look back and extract happiness from every moment together, and twice as much whenever I was hugging you.
I never saw you as a separate person, or as just a being. We were a plant. You were another part of me, and our relationship was critical to our survival. I’m sorry that I let our symbiotic system down. I really want you to evolve and become an independent organism, but I also really do not. I had begun to realize that I am a very selfish person, and this situation could not be an exception. However, is it selfish that I am longing for something (someone) who is entirely essential to my life?
Being able to love someone is a luxury. It denotes a level or two above primitivity. My love for you is second to my absolute need for you. It’s hard for me to believe that heaven is a place if I am there without my mom.
I close my eyes and miss your milk smell and soft little hair. Your body’s skin blanketing strong muscles merging like a mouth talking to me, reminding me of how you taught me to run, to love myself, to work hard, and that I can absolutely do the impossible.
But those are merely beautiful pieces of wrapping paper that protect the person with whom I have laughed painfully hard, felt better, said everything. The person I have screamed at, have tried to heal, and have hurt again. The person that I had never stopped trying to figure out, because I realized how necessary it was to my figuring out myself. If I wasn’t right with you, then nothing was right. I think the thing I disliked the most about you was how much power you had over me, naturally. The world was dismal at best when we were at odds. 
Leaving you at this age is hard because the final result of ME hasn’t been created yet. I was still being tinkered on by life, God, everything and everyone. You know I hated to miss out, and I don’t think that feeling has ever been greater than right now, imagining all of the pedicures, Diet Cokes, split meals, free drinks, pranks, Law and Order, and involuntary laughs that I will be missing out on, that we will be missing out on. We will miss out together.
We will still be bonded by the absence of each other. It’s not as fun as a bond that includes watermelon Lip Smackers and inside jokes (if you could remember any of them!), but it’s a bond nonetheless. And it will keep us together.
Until next time,
Your only daughter and occasional bunny,
Alyson ♦

The miner sees a mirage. He sees something glimmer, and believes that he’s struck gold. He keeps digging and digging, but finds only the glimmer, not the gold itself. He doesn’t know if he will ever find what he’s after, or if he should just stop, give up and turn away from the fool’s gold sparkling in front of him. I have been that miner ever since I arrived in Switzerland.
My marriage brought with it a sliver of happiness, placing me under the illusion that I was safe and that all was well. I thought that if I wanted it and strived for it, one day I would feel safe. But things are only getting more and more complicated. Unanticipated problems are constantly popping up, bringing me back to chaos and loss—two things that I had my fill of at home in Syria during the hell my country went through.
One of my problems is the little child who is coming—the one in my belly right now, who will enter my unstable life. The thought of him coming sends me into an inescapable vortex. This vortex, full of darkness and fear, makes me think and ask: What misery is waiting for this poor creature? What kind of bad education will he receive from a mom who is exhausted, sad, and in pain? Will I pass on to him all the pain and suffering, these incurable diseases I’ve contracted during our crisis in Syria?
These questions control my thoughts completely. I cannot find any answers to calm me down or diminish my confusion. Recently, I’ve realized that this is a test that requires me to make the hardest decision of my life. I have to be strong and wise. I must create some objective distance and look at things rationally. Practically, I am pulled to somehow get rid of the problem, but my heart stops me every time I think that way. I cannot be the one to kill such great happiness for anyone, especially not my husband, who becomes happier and healthier the more this child within me grows.
I feel that way when I look into my husband’s eyes. I see nothing but love and devotion. All of my hope comes from him, and that truly stops me, not because I’m scared of him, but because I feel that I must make a sacrifice for that love. I know that my decision to keep the baby will cost me a lot of physical and psychological work. But honestly, this is the first time that I have felt like I am a real wife—a wife who makes sacrifices for her husband, a wife who is no longer a dependent kid being taken care of by her dad, but rather, a giving wife who works hard to keep her life going and to establish a family. When I think about running away from my responsibility as a mom, I get a feeling that starts a debate within me, revealing the full range of my weaknesses. I will not run, and I will not back away, and I will try with all of my might to become a real mom and an exemplary wife.
If I disregard all of the negativity that it planted within me, the Syrian crisis has taught me to have strength and to face challenges. I will face my challenges. That is my final decision. Now, I am working on programming my brain in such a way that the coming of this baby will bring me indescribable happiness for my home—my child will become the medicine that will cure me of my problems. I want to rid myself of the negativity that has come into my life since I discovered I was pregnant. I realize completely that what I am saying is not an easy thing to do. But this is not impossible. I also know that this child is not the only challenge that I will face. Who knows what challenges await me in the future? Perhaps they are tougher than what I have already faced.
The second-largest issue affecting my life at the moment is the return of my family to Germany. I am scared that when they travel my weakness will return because through all of this, through the past five years of violence and sadness and fear, we have always stuck together and given each other strength. I’m reminded of the aphorism about wooden matches, about how it is difficult to break them all together, as a group, while it is very easy to break them in isolation, one by one. Sticking together as a family gives us strength. Unfortunately, the resettlement laws in Europe do not recognize that.
My mother is a strong woman. She is trying hard to stay here in Switzerland, doing everything in her power in the hope that we will find a way to stay together. But I’m afraid that despite her best efforts, we are losing the battle. She even tried sending a request to the German government, imploring them to allow us to stay here together. I went to visit her recently, after being unable to see her for 10 days because I was sick. She seemed tired, but her eyes shone with hope. She never lets go of that hope to keep us safe. Sometimes I am amazed by her. I wish I could be like her because despite the circumstances, despite her weariness, she always manages to give me strength. When she is close to me, I feel that we are overflowing with safety. She charges me with strength. When I saw her, my optimism rose and my ability to give, despite my sadness, gained strength. I felt, once again, the power and the will to create happiness for my husband, for my child, and for myself.
Maybe a better life is waiting for me, hidden beyond all those hurdles. I must admit that I have started to seriously feel a happiness I’ve never felt before. It is a magical feeling to have a child within me, and to feel myself becoming a mom, but the idea of my family ending up somewhere else hurts me. I hope that the hearts of the governments of Switzerland and Germany will soften toward us. I hope that, somehow, we will be allowed to stay together. But I’m scared that soon my small family may be split apart. ♦

My aunt died while I was away at school a few weeks ago, and I couldn’t go to the funeral because of an exam. I’m heartbroken over that. I don’t know why I think all my relatives will live forever. Maybe because we’re all so funny and vivacious; our spirits are infinite colorful light beams that go on and on. I thought we were immortal, until my uncle died a few years ago when I was a sophomore. I saw the pain in my grandmother’s face, the pain in my dad’s after losing his little brother to cancer. The person he probably used to sneak out with and tease had left the world before him. That was one of those humanizing moments for my dad. We see our parents as these know-everything gods who are unbreakable, but in that moment I saw him as man who lost his brother, someone who can recall fond memories but who now looks back on them with a twinge of pain. 
Beyoncé dropped her new album Lemonade with a hour-long movie. During an interlude, before “Freedom” starts to play, you hear two women talking and one goes, “I’m sorry but I love the Lord.” I smiled because her voice sounded very similar to my recently deceased aunt’s. Then there are scenes that focus on dining room tables, which were so significant to me. My grandma’s dining room is something that is forever: A place where no matter what drama is going on in the family, we all come together to enjoy a meal and show love to my grandma, even if it feels like we don’t like each other. The whole family meets in that room. And meeting there with two fewer people seems frightening—something is out of place. Life really has these moments when it reminds us that this is all fleeting. Everything is going to come to an end and things can change in a second. Losing my mom at a young age taught me this, but lately, it has been magnifying my depression. I’m not feeling worse, just remembering that my depression really is a part of me and will be with me for the rest of my life. ♦

The trees have flowers and leaves now. They didn’t last week. 
My stomach churns pondering looming subject tests, AP tests, SATs, and pool parties.
On weekends I wander crosstown with friends by foot. My heels are scuffed and dusty when I come home at night. I don’t wash them before I jump into bed to sleep on white sheets. My friends and I, we sit in parks and go hiking and dance in backyards. Most days, ice cream feels like an adequate meal.
My roots grow in blonde, blonder than ever. This maybe sucks because at the moment, my hair is dyed a dark brown, but it really doesn’t, because: sunlight.
I pity the time I spend indoors, although it is, admittedly, a lot. Why? There’s still work to be done. Monotonous, tedious, hard work. I just want to go outside, or be getting ready to go outside. Crosswind from the two open windows soothes me on both sides. It smells like life and joy and cow shit; this is spring air.
I am decaying from within. It’s the sleep deprivation.
Outside, everything blooms. ♦

I dreamt every bizarre dream in the world, in one night. I can’t remember the last time I had dreams so vivid and terrifying as these. I can’t reconcile myself to the idea that these scenarios of utter gore came from my own mind, or were influenced by me. Let me let go of these images here.
At a hospital, an elderly couple hyperventilates. Not long after, they start heaving—heavily, laboriously, as if battling death. I look around. There is no nurse or attendant in sight. I stand terrified.
I snap out of fear and terror and realize that nurses and other hospital attendants are now bustling about the hospital corridors, attending to the elderly couple. I can see that they don’t have any medical equipment that could help the couple. Feeling like I have training and experience in saving lives and other emergency situations, I step in and interrupt them. They stop in their tracks, gaping at me.
I find myself frantically running at an unfamiliar pace, in a place altogether strange and unknown. Apparently, there’s a blackout in this area, but I can see a pink neon sign on the roof of a house, although I can’t clearly make out what it says. I’ve been running for quite some time, and I can see that some people are running on this same track, in the same direction, as me. I wondered why they haven’t looked at me, or spoken to me. Can’t they see me? Am I invisible to them?
A gnarly group of men—specifically, skater boys—are gathered around a skate park’s corner, giving someone directions. I pass by, eavesdrop, and interrupt them as I skedaddle on my own skateboard, giving the lost person my own set of instructions. They turn around, shocked, and shout, “Who do you think you are, pretentious bitch! TBH you’re not really a good skater!”
Now my grandmother and I are walking home when, out of the blue, a group of really aggressive, foul-sounding men start to surround us. They sneer at us both, but most especially at me. I am baffled by this sudden aggression. They’re getting real close to us, my grandmother and I. My instincts kicking in, I order my grandma to “just go” and assure her “I’ll take care of this.” I discover that the men were offended by my arrogance, the way I interrupted their “procedures” at the hospital, the way I eavesdropped on those skaters. I give them a look that lets them know I’m not sorry. They each give me a stern warning that I’ll be repaid, in full, for what I’ve done.
My tooth, as though it were an enamel-lined box, starts to break at the front. It looks like a wall that’s been punched in, thereby creating a small hole. It feels gritty, weird, and gross. I push a finger through it, taking out what look like shards of glass. Really they’re tiny shards of tooth. There’s an ant slowly chewing away at the insides of my tooth, I find. I reach inside the small hole in my tooth, I reach inside and touch the ant, and as I reach inside and touch it, I decide to kill it by crushing it. Now I’m left with a half-tooth with a hole in its surface, where anyone can see through to the flesh inside.
My dad, whom I have not seen in a very long time, seems to have been cuffed by the policemen. He has a concerned, scared look in his eyes as he says, shakily, “Where do we go now, Kiana? What do we do?” I reach out to him, take hold of his left hand and, even though he was handcuffed a moment before, turn his palms upward to face the sky. I touch his left wrist lightly, the lightest I’ve touched anyone, with my pointer finger and said, “Hey…Remember.” I was trying to conjure something in him.
My tongue, or a part of my tongue, appears to have been carved out of another body, carved out as though it’s part of an intricate puzzle. I notice this when the flesh—soft, warm, raw— falls out of my mouth. I can taste blood; I spit. There, I find myself thinking, I’m holding my flesh, my tongue, a part of me, myself. I remember the sacred communion, the body of Christ. I am my own body of Christ. I put the puzzle piece-shaped chunk of flesh right back where it belongs. ♦

I hate complaining. I hate being sad. I hate hating. What I hate most of all is that the cause of this is so small in the scheme of my miraculous and fortunate life. I want to tell you all about how art is going well, how much I’m learning, about my friends who are endlessly swaddling me in a metaphorical blanket of love, loyalty, and many other things. I want to tell you that I often stop after my runs and pray “thank you” to God for giving me two legs to run with. 
But see, all of those things become air when the tsunami starts up. Soon, they don’t exist. Do they exist? I forget. All I can believe is real is what’s in front of me, about to demolish me with the groundbreaking slap of one watery arm. Buckle up. But with what? We are so deflated from the last one, what is there?
There is a mirror. I hope it likes me today, because I don’t know what I will do if it doesn’t. How easy our relationship would be if I was just skinny. Undisputably skinny. “So, you mean skinny as in when-you-were-having-problems skinny?” Perhaps. But I know that that didn’t resolve our problems. It still hated me. It became jealous that I was getting smaller, and punished me accordingly. How can I trust what it says now? 
I end the night feeling OK. But that is the first time today that I felt anything above yuck about my thighs, about our relationship today. I’m still mad. Why couldn’t you have pulled yourself together earlier? How do I know that what it shows me in the heat of the hate isn’t true? It tries to make up with me, like now, showing me what I think could be real. But was before simply a misunderstanding? Or was that the one moment of clarity?
I want to break up. ♦

I was really excited to go to L.A. I’ve been wanting to go for a long time, and it’s been a couple of years since I’ve been. I wasn’t sure if we would go because of what happened last week, and especially because my dad is the parent in charge of this trip. 
As I mentioned, my parents have been trying this thing where they take away my phone, which has mostly just been fucking up the rest of my life instead of teaching me discipline or responsibility. Anyways, we left for L.A. and it seemed fine: My dad even gave me my phone for the weekend. Since I was hoping for a good trip, I tried my best to make sure it would be good, but everything blew up in my face—really fast. 
One minute I was eating a really delicious breakfast, and the next my dad had me slammed up against a wall for asking him to not be pissy so that the trip wouldn’t be ruined. Well, it was ruined by that. So now we’re here and I haven’t been able to do anything that I want, although my mom convinced him after the fight to let me and my sister go to LACMA. I guess on the bright side, I got a really cool book at the museum. It’s more like a journal, and it’s to help me organize my thoughts, to some extent. It’s called Connect the Thoughts. There wasn’t anything else good about the trip, though. My dad confiscated my phone again, and made us stay at the hotel for the rest of the day (it was the afternoon when the incident happened), and found a flight for us to leave early. 
Knowing that my dad would hurt me is kinda a wake up call. He’s done it before, but I’ve never seen him look like that before. Or maybe he has and I just hadn’t noticed. I’m not sure. I’m just scared to be around him. And I want my mom to have full custody of me, because it’s just not safe here anymore. ♦

1. I forget that I have to turn in a proposal for my cultural history research paper in two days. I’ve had my topic for months, but my cursor winks malevolently at me from an empty page, dim and chilling on my laptop screen. My phone is turned off and an extension on my browser blacklists any websites that might distract me and I tell myself, Concentrate, concentrate! But it doesn’t come. I start putting together sources instead. The proposal isn’t worth that much of my grade. I’ll write it tomorrow.
2. I catch myself grinding my teeth. It’s rare. Sometimes I’ll wake up with my jaw clenched and it actually takes a moment to ease out of it. For some reason it won’t be sore later, but the rest of me will be, no matter how little our coach makes us run at soccer practice.
3. We’ve won two games and lost one. Scored 10 goals and conceded nine; not the best average. But we are exhausted and no one knows why. At the end of practice one day, our coach stops us mid-scrimmage and we all fall over each other, the cold air twists tight around our lungs. “Get on the line,” he says. We haven’t been satisfactory. I sprint faster than I have all week, chest heaving, stomach full of misdirected anger. I can’t tell if it’s at him or at myself or at all of us or at no one, but I don’t care, not as long as it keeps my heart beating and my legs working.
4. I pass a Calculus test. I sit in the corner and write furiously while the rest of my class retakes it.
5. I count the days on my fingers. Graduation is on a Sunday, but us seniors will hardly be at school the previous week. Our class officers send out information about the annual senior trip and one of my friends texts me, “Are you going?” I’m not. But I wasn’t expecting anyone to care if I was. I reconsider. My parents offer to split the cost. It’s a good deal, they say. You’ll earn plenty working this summer.
6. Over spring break I went kitesurfing. Kites I am decent with; surfing I am not. The instructor complimented the smoothness of my flights and then laughed when I wiped out repeatedly on the board. But it wasn’t cruel. I laughed along, self-deprecating, raring to try again. Eventually the wind died. We took the jet ski back to shore. I was peeling myself out of my wetsuit when my mom said, “Are you bleeding?” I’d lost all the skin off my knuckles and a horrendous red bruise was in full, colorful bloom on my right knee. But I was still laughing, raking a hand through my salty hair. “I’m fine,” I told her.
7. Sometimes it is still hard to focus, and sometimes I look in the mirror and it takes me a moment to recognize the person looking back at me. I meet their eyes and I am confused for a split second—and then it passes. I have the whole summer, I tell myself. Months to figure out who I am and who I’m going to be. Next year will be a fresh start, if I make it one. ♦

Every show or film or song that I listen to is about the hardships that friends go through, or the fun that they have when they hang out at the mall. I can’t relate. The combination of being 13 and also having super overprotective parents means that I’m not allowed to go out by myself. So, the only interactions I have with people my age are at school and, unluckily, I have no friends there. I’m always the subject of laughter at school for some reason. I really long for a friend. I can imagine drinking smoothies in the shopping centre, or playing basketball in the park with a group of companions. But I guess I’ll never know how it feels. 
All I do is read, watch films, and listen to music. And although that sounds really fun, I feel lonely. Sometimes, I just want to cry. I’m dreading the first day back after Easter break because I have no one to talk to. I don’t even talk at school, which explains why people always look at me like I’m a demented ghost who has been haunting the science block since 1990 when she accidentally was killed in an explosion. (That sounds like an episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark that I watched recently). I’m honestly not like that at all. I’m just too shy to start a conversation. I wish someone would talk to me who’s not my mum, dad, sister, or my dog. I feel like such a loser.
But when I really think about it, my teenhood will end one day and I’ll be an adult and none of this will bother me anymore. I dream of the day when I can wear what I want, go where I want to go and when I don’t have to ask my Mum if I can dye my hair or not. If anything, I feel worse about being a girl because I feel nervous going places by myself and I can’t wear shorts that fall above my knees. But now I’m prioritizing my first world problems: How can I be so selfish when there are innocent people dying from poverty and war. I can’t believe how self-centred I can be. 
Maybe having friends isn’t that important. I think I prefer sitting in my room, listening to my Frank Sinatra cassette. ♦

When I was 13, I had a notebook. On the front cover, I wrote “THIS IS A NOTEBOOK”—I thought it was very ironic. I wrote a poem in the notebook. It went like this:
The way he laughs, his crooked teeth. I love him but he doesn’t love me.
His Franco smile, he’s such a bad liar; he can’t admit the truth.
He loves her, without a clue.
His Khaki pants, his tacky jokes, he’s quite a caring little bloke.
He cares about me, but only a bit. With her, it’s different.
She always has him, he’s nice and he’s kind. So hard to find.
He doesn’t see it, neither does she. “We’re just friends,” that’s what he says.
I know how I feel. I know this won’t change.
Maybe he is just a name, a face, a person, someone strange.
We will never happen, and I’m not ashamed.
After all, there’s always James. 
When I wrote this poem, I loved one boy a lot. It’s likely that the only person I’ve loved more than this boy was James Franco himself.
I don’t love this boy anymore. I don’t think I love any boy anymore. But I’m still very jealous. I still feel uniquely alone. ♦

In most cases, the body hosts disease for a long time before the symptoms begin to show. It seems that what I experienced back in Syria was similar—the symptoms developed only after I left.
The most difficult symptom is the mood swings: I go from extreme elation to extreme sadness, seemingly at the drop of a hat. Sometimes I even amaze myself—I don’t understand all of the emotions that are housed inside my body. What scares me is that there is a new life growing within this sick soul of mine.
Only two months after getting married, I discovered that I was pregnant. A little human being with a heart and a soul is growing inside of me. I did not mean to get pregnant—it just happened. How should I feel? Should I be happy? Should I be sad? I don’t know.
My reaction to the news was very strange, and it hurt my husband, who could not comprehend what was going on inside of me.
I was so exhausted by the move to our new apartment that I fainted, and they rushed me to the doctor. When I opened my eyes, I saw my husband standing next to me, with a big smile on his face, happiness nearly gushing out of his eyes.
He told me, his voice trembling, that I was going to have a baby and that he was going to be a father in a few months. There was love, care and appreciation in his voice, as if I had just given him the most precious gift in the world, but my reaction destroyed his happy world. I was stressed. I began to scream that I didn’t want the baby. I literally shattered his happiness, which I fear is becoming a special skill of mine. What is happening to me?
He was silent until we arrived back home, and then he asked me about the reason behind my extreme reaction. Was it because I didn’t want his baby? Was it because I was scared? Was it because I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life with him?
I couldn’t answer because I didn’t have any convincing reason to give him, or maybe I was just too embarrassed to tell him the reason. What do I say to him? Do I tell him that I don’t think that I’m qualified to raise a baby? Do I tell him that I cannot carry such responsibility? Do I tell him that I’m afraid that after all of the oppression I suffered, I might become a tyrant with our child? I blanketed myself in silence. I was stressed out for three days, but then I turned to my mother. I told her how I was afraid that the curse of war might follow my child. She laughed and said, “Wait until you feel him moving inside of you, and then come talk to me.”
In some moments, I just want to get rid of the baby, and be done with everything, but I stop myself because I know that this decision is not mine alone to make. Other times, I look at my body and I imagine how it will change, and I wonder about the movement inside of me that my mom mentioned. I do want to experience it. I do want to be a mother, but I’m afraid that I won’t live up to that title.
However, when I see the flowers blooming in our neighborhood, I tell myself that there is beauty with everything that is newly born, and spring is how the world is reborn every year. I tell myself that this new baby might mean a whole new life and a whole new beginning for me, but soon that other feeling returns, and the past, present and future become dark. I don’t know if anyone can understand—I feel imprisoned, and the walls are closing in on me. I am suffocating. How weak I feel!
I hate being weak, and I always do my best to survive, but this time, it’s too much for me. I can’t tell my husband all of this. I know that he wants to become a father. This is his right, and it’s not my place to take it away from him. I can’t do this to him. I can’t do this to my baby. And I can’t do this to myself.
But what if I fail as a mother? I realize how important a mother’s role is, and I also realize how much mothers sacrifice, and I do not know if I am capable of such giving. I am tired. Not knowing what decision to make hurts. Not knowing what I want hurts even more. This is where I am. I no longer suffer from the bombs and bullets, but from the fears and illusions that my body now hosts. I call them illusions because I’m trying to deny that they are real.
The only solution I see is to ignore these feelings, and hope that they die from neglect. I truly want to have a baby and raise him to become a strong person, but…I don’t know what’s going to happen. I truly don’t. ♦

I feel uncomfortable posting in certain groups on Facebook and other social media at the moment. There is a lot of discrimination toward un- and underrepresented groups, and irritation toward people who are not in those groups and who act in oppressive ways by taking up space in online discussions. 
I don’t always know where I stand or how much privilege I have, because I don’t entirely know my identity—I’m at the intersection of so many. I’m mixed race, but because I’m white passing, I don’t feel like a person of color. Is it correct for me to claim that title? I have a non-binary gender identity, but I’m also a femme AFAB (assigned female at birth), which gives me privilege when standing alongside other non-binary and trans folk.
I feel a bit stuck, a bit disconnected from a community of people that originally saved me. I’m often told that as a queer, mixed race, mentally ill woman I should take up as much space as I want and need to. But I’m also told that I shouldn’t take up as much space as I do because—due to my privilege as a white passing, middle-class, able-bodied person—I’m silencing those who need to be heard. 
I’m not sure what I’m meant to do. ♦

I have this idea for a painting. It came to me on a not-great night, but that’s generally how things happen. It’s a thigh, with the curvy part being removed. It’s not gory or even bloody: It’s like a Salvador Dali painting in the way that this major event is happening, but the world around it is like, “lol chill, it no big.” The knife hovers between the newly butchered leg and the “extra” cut away. The background is a light-ish indio blue, and the color scheme is blue and orange complementary. It looks great.
I tried to paint it today but I couldn’t bear to look at it. To give myself some slack, the leg as I imagined it is at the toughest possible angle—looking at it from the front but to some degree from the side. But what does slack matter when you simply can’t portray the image that says what you can’t? It was so one-dimensional that I couldn’t even comprehend what it was. I wiped it off with a makeup wipe because fucking oil can’t just be painted over with gesso. It now resembles a tan tree trunk with a nubby branch. Accurate.
I have spent two hours trying to calm the uprising inside me. I almost didn’t paint anything today because I was afraid that I would feel exactly like this. But I painted anyways. I’ll be proud of myself today for painting anyways. ♦

Power interruptions have plagued our region for a while now, but it’s only recently that these little annoyances have got into my nerves. See, these power interruptions happen at random. Sometimes there are nights when the lights go out at a specific time, and this goes on for two, three consecutive days, urging me to think they’ve already scheduled the power outages. But no, these power interruptions are out to get me.
During these times, the only thing to hear is the beating of my heart, and loneliness is my only friend. It’s inescapable, which is why maybe I hate it. Other times, I go out to run at a nearby park, just to take my mind off my body, even for a while. To not think of anything besides muscles straining and lungs heaving to keep up, keep up, keep up with my mind’s willingness to push through the next curve, and the next. Until I reach a mindlessness, a space in my psyche where I can exist and breathe, exist and breathe, exist and breathe—nothing more or less.
This perpetual loneliness is haunting—although it may sometimes manifest itself as a curse, I hold it as a talisman, sacred. Right here, in this solitary space, I declare it holy. ♦

I completely failed at my version of self-care last week. I was having crying fits and anxiety attacks all through the night and was frustrated with not being able to sleep. I had a 10:35 class in the morning, which I am always late for, so at 6:30 AM, I accepted that there was no way I was going to fall asleep. I planned to used the extra three hours to shower, wash my hair, do yoga, and catch up on homework. That will definitely put my mind at ease, I thought to myself. I was so motivated, I got up ran to my hair care basket, and saw that I left my combs at home, How could I be so stupid? I had another self-hate episode on how I’m the stupidest person on earth who can’t function as a productive human being. I can’t even remember to bring hair essentials back to school after spring break? My lip trembled with disappointment. 
After giving myself a mental beating, I opted to detangle my hair with my fingers while I washed and conditioned it. I didn’t wanna give up. I had a fantasy of being able to tell myself that I was productive before noon for the first time in months. By the time I was done in the shower I decided I was still way too tired from not sleeping, so I hopped back in bed, and set an alarm for 9:30 AM, leaving me enough time to do yoga and study. Only problem was I slept through the alarm and I woke up at 10:25 AM, making me late for class again. I was irate and anxious, and telling myself I was worthless and wasn’t gonna amount to anything if I can’t even wake up on time. It was the end of the world, I felt like a failure. I got lucky and arrived just two minutes late. My professor had also just walked in, and marked me present.
Class wasn’t too hard. When it finished, I approached my professor to discuss areas I needed to work on. I had been doing better than I thought I would on tests, yet I struggled with the homework. She told me it was fine, and that I could come to her for extra help whenever. This was the opposite of how I thought she’d react. For months I dreaded asking her about extra help, thinking it would result in her being angry with me. This prompted me to take a look at how my anxiety affects my everyday activities, it keeps me from being able to rationalize between a life a or death situation and me just being forgetful or a bit scattered like every other person. In reality it was fine, and she was truly understanding. 
My anxiety keeps me up at night and tells me not to leave bed in the morning. It’s a miniscule, mind-crippling monster made from pencil scribblings, with wild hair and yellow eyes, that screams inside me—from the very bottom of my body so by the time it reaches my brain it is just a whisper—telling me that my life is still a despicable mess and I’ll never amount to anything, so I should just lay down and pretend to be dead, because I’ll probably just screw it up even more by trying to accomplish anything. 
Describing it now, I can’t believe that I walk around with this ghastly, horrifying feeling. I saw anxiety as a flaw that inconvenienced everyone else but me, not something I should look at and take care of with kindness and care. Whenever I got angsty or overwhelmed growing up, my family would just get annoyed and tell me to calm down. It wasn’t a mental illness to the adults around me, just Thahabu “being extra and overthinking everything.” I talked to my therapist about the episode I had, and she pointed out that I always go to the worst-case scenario, and that I’m way too hard on myself. “Instead of saying you’re stupid, try saying you’re sad, because that’s what’s really going on,” she said. She was right, I don’t give myself the time or space to be sad, and replacing “stupid” and “incompetent” with “wow, I’m going through a lot, of course I’m worried and sad,” did make me feel like less of a problem. 
I am slowly accepting that my anxiety is real. Although I had a terrible time trying to make myself feel better that morning, I still set a goal of waking up at 9 AM every day to do yoga and other activities that make me feel good. I love the feeling of being up while everyone else is asleep. Using the time to read is the best; because sometimes depression can make you lose interest in the things that you once loved. I haven’t been able to finish a book in a year but this weekend I got lost in The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan. 
I haven’t quite stuck to the 9 AM rule yet, but maybe it’s not supposed to happen all at once. Maybe it is waking up before 12 PM, and knowing that I’m making the effort to get up and make myself happy. That’s progress. I’m building the desire to do things, and reminding myself that these things do make me happy. I’m having to reconstruct myself: put all of the shattered parts of me back together and get to know them again. It feels so good to indulge in things that I thought had dried up and fallen off me like leaves from a tree in Fall. I know that spring is around the corner and the leaves always grow back. ♦

A reworked version of the Bee Gees’ song “Massachusetts.” 
Feel I’m going back to Massachusetts,
Something’s telling me I must go tour.
And the wifi is weak in Massachusetts,
The signal booster I left sitting at home.
Tried to stay my ass in New Jersey,
Would rather spend some time with my friends.
But the colleges are all in Massachusetts,
And Daddy brought me here to see my future.
Talk about the res life in Massachusetts,
Ask about the scores that I will not get.
And my heart was nearly destroyed by Massachusetts,
And Massachusetts is one place I’ve toured.
I will remember Massachusetts. ♦

I wish I had pictures of every single one of the scabs I picked as a small girl so I could put it on this shirt. I can see all of them on a rotating rack—me on my bed, on the polka dots, wiping blood on the wall. Me inching my stubby fingertips underneath a barely raised crust and holding my breath as I heard that slight snap of skin ripping. You really had to listen for it, and I liked that the most. I used to train my ears to do a lot. 
Sundays in my old apartment had a certain ugliness that made me cry when I woke up. One Sunday, I had a dream that the world ended and I woke up and remembered that my mother was alive and clung to her until she got annoyed. Last January, I woke up from a dream where she had died and I woke up looking for her comfort and remembered something different. I didn’t go to school that day. 
I told someone that I was the last Oracle of Delphi and they said that I was probably the first because it was all bullshit. What is there left to say when all of your intrusive thoughts come true? I panicked one night and couldn’t fall asleep so I crawled over my mom and locked myself in the bathroom and bawled and PLEADED SO HARD out loud with God—for 20 minutes straight—not to take her away from me, not to let her die, please God I’m so sorry anything but her. I prayed in my mind, too, in case my voice was a transgression. This was years before cancer. That’s how I know. 
She came to the door and asked me if I was OK. If I could swallow up her voice now and hold it in my mouth like a bullfrog I would never talk again. The glow through my skin would be enough. 
My favorite scar, left leg, is gone. It was from my favorite park in Prospect Heights. There are others but I don’t remember their moments. My favorite scar on another person, left hand, is gone. It was from my best source. ♦

I want to believe. I want to believe that good days far outnumber the bad. I want to believe that people are softer, gentler, kinder than what I make them out to be in my head. I want to believe that everything’s going to be OK, if I only let things run their natural course. I want to believe that I can take on the world, one breath at a time.
I got good quality trousers at a thrift market last Wednesday. The act of going outside to do something lightens me, and fills me with gratitude. The past few days have been rough, what with the looming certainty of going back to college in two months!!! I’ve also been loading up on caffeine, which is a bit anxiety-inducing, and terrifying because the comedown is not good. Somehow, I always think and feel that I’m dying.
I’m also engaged in a truckload of trying this week:

To eat on time and hydrate more. My care-savvy self wants me to “get back on track” or “keep up” with the coming stressors that college will bring. EEEEP.
To be thankful for things that I usually just ignore.
To not forget my multivitamins, but also to not be overly anxious about it to the point of imbibing twice the recommended daily intake.
To formulate a study routine, or a general routine, that will suit my needs when I’m finally back, hustlin’ at school.
To be patient with algebra, a subject I’m still stuck on, and a loser chicken in.
To control my head, this madness throbbing stealthily inside, while also trying not to suppress my angst and unusual grouchiness.
To place my feet firmly on the ground. To make decisions for myself—small decisions, big decisions, consequential decisions—and be accountable and own up to them.
Since the university I’m enrolling in is a bit more expensive than the university I used to attend, I’m trying to be brave and self-sufficient enough to face cranky adults in government offices, so that I can score educational aid. It’s stressful but, surprisingly, I have the strength now to power through.
Trying to lessen my vanity and recycle old eyeshadow palettes, and use what I have. to save money for when I truly need it. Somehow I still feel like splurging on a face mask, the peeling skincare stuff Arabelle Sicardi recommended, and a fire foundation. Damn, beauty is frickin’ terror. ♦

Sometime in the next two weeks I will finally decide where I’m going to spend the next four years of my life.
I’ve been thinking about where I’m going so much that I’m neglecting where I am right now. An English paper sits unfinished in an open tab in my browser, but another tab holds a sample schedule I constructed—should I end up at my top choice school—neatly laid out in a spreadsheet, detailed with class times and lab hours and notes like “Spanish or Russian?” and “replace with ASTR 113 if I test out of calc.” Laying it all out like that makes the future seem very real but at the same time not real enough, because I still have all of these other responsibilities weighing on my shoulders for the next month or so. I’m not at a point yet where I can just say “screw it” to my next soccer game or calculus test. Or English paper.
I visit that same school of my timetable dreams, do my first overnight on campus. The math professor I meet with is delighted to recommend his department’s data science minor to complement an astronomy major, and is overjoyed to discover that I have surpassed the school’s three-semester calculus curriculum. “You’ve already covered vector calculus?” he demands. I nod. “Sequences and series?” Another nod. “I’ll have to get you in touch with the chair of the department. This could open up a slot for you to take my statistical modeling class,” he hints. His last name is the same as my birthstone. Maybe it’s fate.
I get an extension on the English paper.
The National Women’s Soccer League kicks off its fourth season, marking the first time that a women’s professional organization has lasted more than three years in the U.S. While I’m on my college visit, my own soccer team takes a bus two hours out of town to beat some poor team 11-0.
“Senior night is May, 5!” someone says cheerfully. And everything will go from there: prom, our senior trip, graduation. Maybe it’ll finally be real enough when I can throw my cap in the air and say I’m done, done for good, done with this school and this town and this final crushing month. ♦

Anne Carson talks about the gender of sound: I am blahblahblah and WOULD YOU BE QUIET ALREADY and banshee wailing in the fifth floor girls’ bathroom. I limit myself to the second and third floors for today, and already I am relieved of the sin of small talk. No one can ignore me now. I’ve all but perfected the art of not being trampled. 
I leave Spanish class to cry about my mom and write about her beloved tulips and St. Michael necklace and the plant of mine she watered for almost a decade. I can’t feel her presence in the 79 degree weather but I know that she is not cold wind but fresh air. This is all her. I have to learn to recognize her without the car crash scar and the baby lotion scent. 
In my family, we don’t die. My mother has no headstone. Sometimes I think that I’ll open up her ashes and see nothing because this has all been a hoax and she is somewhere in San Fernando becoming one with her mother’s country dirt. I don’t know what I’ll do if I can’t meet her family this summer. It is my last one before I am an adult. I can’t be, I can’t be an adult already. The movement of years makes no sense to me. She would have been 50 when I was 18. My favorite of the soiled milestones. 
I am saving up to see them but I haven’t told my father’s side (my caretakers) yet because I hate when logic ruins my plans. I believe in the wildest. If I didn’t I would drop too quickly—the weight of reality would be too much. I know I can do it. She’s watching me. ♦

You know that feeling you get in the morning, when you wake up and realize you have to get out of bed and go to school or work? You have to do that thing called living. And you’re so tired but you manage to bundle up what seems like all your energy to get out of bed and take a shower and do the thing expected of you.
Now imagine feeling that constantly, ten times worse, every time you move or speak, every time you make a minor decision. That’s depression, for me—at least part of it.
Then there’s this looming sense of sharpness and panic, which is the anxiety, occasionally spiking when you have to do something under pressure or unplanned. That feeling you get before a first date or a presentation, an interview, something where you feel vulnerable: It’s that feeling following you around, constantly. ♦

The following is a “goodbye letter” to my mom that I wrote as part of the Every 15 Minutes program held at my high school, and many others, to promote awareness of drinking and driving. Around 40 of the 3,800 kids at my school were chosen to be part of the program, and my participation signified a teenager that had died in a drug- or alcohol-related car accident. After staging a live car accident—complete with ambulances, a helicopter, and the jaws of life—we 40 took trips to the county jail and morgue, then went to stay the night at a hotel, where we were cut off from the outside world completely, to represent our absence from the world as victims of this horrendous crime. It was there, after hearing graphic story after graphic story from now-graying and forever grieving parents who had lost their kids to drunk driving, that we wrote these letters.
***
Dear Mom,
I can’t express to you what things will be like now that I am gone, or even how I want them to be, specifically. Well, I would like a legacy. Maybe you can try to publish my writing and exhibit my art? I can’t say what life will mean for you now, and I can’t understand the difference, but I’ll try to understand it by pretending that I’m losing you.
Lying on my bed with you or sitting next to you in the car after school is what I dream about. When my mind was a hell, that’s all that I wanted. I could feel every emotion and every sadness during that time, but the realization that this sickness was pulling me from your arms was generally the only thought that would draw tears down my sweaty cheeks. I wanted to be back with you.
“I want my girl back.” Words I will never forget. 
I want to be back, too.
I’m glad that I came back for a little while before I had to go forever. Although I was often in pain while those times were happening, I’m able to look back and extract happiness from every moment together, and twice as much whenever I was hugging you.
I never saw you as a separate person, or as just a being. We were a plant. You were another part of me, and our relationship was critical to our survival. I’m sorry that I let our symbiotic system down. I really want you to evolve and become an independent organism, but I also really do not. I had begun to realize that I am a very selfish person, and this situation could not be an exception. However, is it selfish that I am longing for something (someone) who is entirely essential to my life?
Being able to love someone is a luxury. It denotes a level or two above primitivity. My love for you is second to my absolute need for you. It’s hard for me to believe that heaven is a place if I am there without my mom.
I close my eyes and miss your milk smell and soft little hair. Your body’s skin blanketing strong muscles merging like a mouth talking to me, reminding me of how you taught me to run, to love myself, to work hard, and that I can absolutely do the impossible.
But those are merely beautiful pieces of wrapping paper that protect the person with whom I have laughed painfully hard, felt better, said everything. The person I have screamed at, have tried to heal, and have hurt again. The person that I had never stopped trying to figure out, because I realized how necessary it was to my figuring out myself. If I wasn’t right with you, then nothing was right. I think the thing I disliked the most about you was how much power you had over me, naturally. The world was dismal at best when we were at odds. 
Leaving you at this age is hard because the final result of ME hasn’t been created yet. I was still being tinkered on by life, God, everything and everyone. You know I hated to miss out, and I don’t think that feeling has ever been greater than right now, imagining all of the pedicures, Diet Cokes, split meals, free drinks, pranks, Law and Order, and involuntary laughs that I will be missing out on, that we will be missing out on. We will miss out together.
We will still be bonded by the absence of each other. It’s not as fun as a bond that includes watermelon Lip Smackers and inside jokes (if you could remember any of them!), but it’s a bond nonetheless. And it will keep us together.
Until next time,
Your only daughter and occasional bunny,
Alyson ♦

The miner sees a mirage. He sees something glimmer, and believes that he’s struck gold. He keeps digging and digging, but finds only the glimmer, not the gold itself. He doesn’t know if he will ever find what he’s after, or if he should just stop, give up and turn away from the fool’s gold sparkling in front of him. I have been that miner ever since I arrived in Switzerland.
My marriage brought with it a sliver of happiness, placing me under the illusion that I was safe and that all was well. I thought that if I wanted it and strived for it, one day I would feel safe. But things are only getting more and more complicated. Unanticipated problems are constantly popping up, bringing me back to chaos and loss—two things that I had my fill of at home in Syria during the hell my country went through.
One of my problems is the little child who is coming—the one in my belly right now, who will enter my unstable life. The thought of him coming sends me into an inescapable vortex. This vortex, full of darkness and fear, makes me think and ask: What misery is waiting for this poor creature? What kind of bad education will he receive from a mom who is exhausted, sad, and in pain? Will I pass on to him all the pain and suffering, these incurable diseases I’ve contracted during our crisis in Syria?
These questions control my thoughts completely. I cannot find any answers to calm me down or diminish my confusion. Recently, I’ve realized that this is a test that requires me to make the hardest decision of my life. I have to be strong and wise. I must create some objective distance and look at things rationally. Practically, I am pulled to somehow get rid of the problem, but my heart stops me every time I think that way. I cannot be the one to kill such great happiness for anyone, especially not my husband, who becomes happier and healthier the more this child within me grows.
I feel that way when I look into my husband’s eyes. I see nothing but love and devotion. All of my hope comes from him, and that truly stops me, not because I’m scared of him, but because I feel that I must make a sacrifice for that love. I know that my decision to keep the baby will cost me a lot of physical and psychological work. But honestly, this is the first time that I have felt like I am a real wife—a wife who makes sacrifices for her husband, a wife who is no longer a dependent kid being taken care of by her dad, but rather, a giving wife who works hard to keep her life going and to establish a family. When I think about running away from my responsibility as a mom, I get a feeling that starts a debate within me, revealing the full range of my weaknesses. I will not run, and I will not back away, and I will try with all of my might to become a real mom and an exemplary wife.
If I disregard all of the negativity that it planted within me, the Syrian crisis has taught me to have strength and to face challenges. I will face my challenges. That is my final decision. Now, I am working on programming my brain in such a way that the coming of this baby will bring me indescribable happiness for my home—my child will become the medicine that will cure me of my problems. I want to rid myself of the negativity that has come into my life since I discovered I was pregnant. I realize completely that what I am saying is not an easy thing to do. But this is not impossible. I also know that this child is not the only challenge that I will face. Who knows what challenges await me in the future? Perhaps they are tougher than what I have already faced.
The second-largest issue affecting my life at the moment is the return of my family to Germany. I am scared that when they travel my weakness will return because through all of this, through the past five years of violence and sadness and fear, we have always stuck together and given each other strength. I’m reminded of the aphorism about wooden matches, about how it is difficult to break them all together, as a group, while it is very easy to break them in isolation, one by one. Sticking together as a family gives us strength. Unfortunately, the resettlement laws in Europe do not recognize that.
My mother is a strong woman. She is trying hard to stay here in Switzerland, doing everything in her power in the hope that we will find a way to stay together. But I’m afraid that despite her best efforts, we are losing the battle. She even tried sending a request to the German government, imploring them to allow us to stay here together. I went to visit her recently, after being unable to see her for 10 days because I was sick. She seemed tired, but her eyes shone with hope. She never lets go of that hope to keep us safe. Sometimes I am amazed by her. I wish I could be like her because despite the circumstances, despite her weariness, she always manages to give me strength. When she is close to me, I feel that we are overflowing with safety. She charges me with strength. When I saw her, my optimism rose and my ability to give, despite my sadness, gained strength. I felt, once again, the power and the will to create happiness for my husband, for my child, and for myself.
Maybe a better life is waiting for me, hidden beyond all those hurdles. I must admit that I have started to seriously feel a happiness I’ve never felt before. It is a magical feeling to have a child within me, and to feel myself becoming a mom, but the idea of my family ending up somewhere else hurts me. I hope that the hearts of the governments of Switzerland and Germany will soften toward us. I hope that, somehow, we will be allowed to stay together. But I’m scared that soon my small family may be split apart. ♦

My aunt died while I was away at school a few weeks ago, and I couldn’t go to the funeral because of an exam. I’m heartbroken over that. I don’t know why I think all my relatives will live forever. Maybe because we’re all so funny and vivacious; our spirits are infinite colorful light beams that go on and on. I thought we were immortal, until my uncle died a few years ago when I was a sophomore. I saw the pain in my grandmother’s face, the pain in my dad’s after losing his little brother to cancer. The person he probably used to sneak out with and tease had left the world before him. That was one of those humanizing moments for my dad. We see our parents as these know-everything gods who are unbreakable, but in that moment I saw him as man who lost his brother, someone who can recall fond memories but who now looks back on them with a twinge of pain. 
Beyoncé dropped her new album Lemonade with a hour-long movie. During an interlude, before “Freedom” starts to play, you hear two women talking and one goes, “I’m sorry but I love the Lord.” I smiled because her voice sounded very similar to my recently deceased aunt’s. Then there are scenes that focus on dining room tables, which were so significant to me. My grandma’s dining room is something that is forever: A place where no matter what drama is going on in the family, we all come together to enjoy a meal and show love to my grandma, even if it feels like we don’t like each other. The whole family meets in that room. And meeting there with two fewer people seems frightening—something is out of place. Life really has these moments when it reminds us that this is all fleeting. Everything is going to come to an end and things can change in a second. Losing my mom at a young age taught me this, but lately, it has been magnifying my depression. I’m not feeling worse, just remembering that my depression really is a part of me and will be with me for the rest of my life. ♦

The trees have flowers and leaves now. They didn’t last week. 
My stomach churns pondering looming subject tests, AP tests, SATs, and pool parties.
On weekends I wander crosstown with friends by foot. My heels are scuffed and dusty when I come home at night. I don’t wash them before I jump into bed to sleep on white sheets. My friends and I, we sit in parks and go hiking and dance in backyards. Most days, ice cream feels like an adequate meal.
My roots grow in blonde, blonder than ever. This maybe sucks because at the moment, my hair is dyed a dark brown, but it really doesn’t, because: sunlight.
I pity the time I spend indoors, although it is, admittedly, a lot. Why? There’s still work to be done. Monotonous, tedious, hard work. I just want to go outside, or be getting ready to go outside. Crosswind from the two open windows soothes me on both sides. It smells like life and joy and cow shit; this is spring air.
I am decaying from within. It’s the sleep deprivation.
Outside, everything blooms. ♦

I dreamt every bizarre dream in the world, in one night. I can’t remember the last time I had dreams so vivid and terrifying as these. I can’t reconcile myself to the idea that these scenarios of utter gore came from my own mind, or were influenced by me. Let me let go of these images here.
At a hospital, an elderly couple hyperventilates. Not long after, they start heaving—heavily, laboriously, as if battling death. I look around. There is no nurse or attendant in sight. I stand terrified.
I snap out of fear and terror and realize that nurses and other hospital attendants are now bustling about the hospital corridors, attending to the elderly couple. I can see that they don’t have any medical equipment that could help the couple. Feeling like I have training and experience in saving lives and other emergency situations, I step in and interrupt them. They stop in their tracks, gaping at me.
I find myself frantically running at an unfamiliar pace, in a place altogether strange and unknown. Apparently, there’s a blackout in this area, but I can see a pink neon sign on the roof of a house, although I can’t clearly make out what it says. I’ve been running for quite some time, and I can see that some people are running on this same track, in the same direction, as me. I wondered why they haven’t looked at me, or spoken to me. Can’t they see me? Am I invisible to them?
A gnarly group of men—specifically, skater boys—are gathered around a skate park’s corner, giving someone directions. I pass by, eavesdrop, and interrupt them as I skedaddle on my own skateboard, giving the lost person my own set of instructions. They turn around, shocked, and shout, “Who do you think you are, pretentious bitch! TBH you’re not really a good skater!”
Now my grandmother and I are walking home when, out of the blue, a group of really aggressive, foul-sounding men start to surround us. They sneer at us both, but most especially at me. I am baffled by this sudden aggression. They’re getting real close to us, my grandmother and I. My instincts kicking in, I order my grandma to “just go” and assure her “I’ll take care of this.” I discover that the men were offended by my arrogance, the way I interrupted their “procedures” at the hospital, the way I eavesdropped on those skaters. I give them a look that lets them know I’m not sorry. They each give me a stern warning that I’ll be repaid, in full, for what I’ve done.
My tooth, as though it were an enamel-lined box, starts to break at the front. It looks like a wall that’s been punched in, thereby creating a small hole. It feels gritty, weird, and gross. I push a finger through it, taking out what look like shards of glass. Really they’re tiny shards of tooth. There’s an ant slowly chewing away at the insides of my tooth, I find. I reach inside the small hole in my tooth, I reach inside and touch the ant, and as I reach inside and touch it, I decide to kill it by crushing it. Now I’m left with a half-tooth with a hole in its surface, where anyone can see through to the flesh inside.
My dad, whom I have not seen in a very long time, seems to have been cuffed by the policemen. He has a concerned, scared look in his eyes as he says, shakily, “Where do we go now, Kiana? What do we do?” I reach out to him, take hold of his left hand and, even though he was handcuffed a moment before, turn his palms upward to face the sky. I touch his left wrist lightly, the lightest I’ve touched anyone, with my pointer finger and said, “Hey…Remember.” I was trying to conjure something in him.
My tongue, or a part of my tongue, appears to have been carved out of another body, carved out as though it’s part of an intricate puzzle. I notice this when the flesh—soft, warm, raw— falls out of my mouth. I can taste blood; I spit. There, I find myself thinking, I’m holding my flesh, my tongue, a part of me, myself. I remember the sacred communion, the body of Christ. I am my own body of Christ. I put the puzzle piece-shaped chunk of flesh right back where it belongs. ♦

I hate complaining. I hate being sad. I hate hating. What I hate most of all is that the cause of this is so small in the scheme of my miraculous and fortunate life. I want to tell you all about how art is going well, how much I’m learning, about my friends who are endlessly swaddling me in a metaphorical blanket of love, loyalty, and many other things. I want to tell you that I often stop after my runs and pray “thank you” to God for giving me two legs to run with. 
But see, all of those things become air when the tsunami starts up. Soon, they don’t exist. Do they exist? I forget. All I can believe is real is what’s in front of me, about to demolish me with the groundbreaking slap of one watery arm. Buckle up. But with what? We are so deflated from the last one, what is there?
There is a mirror. I hope it likes me today, because I don’t know what I will do if it doesn’t. How easy our relationship would be if I was just skinny. Undisputably skinny. “So, you mean skinny as in when-you-were-having-problems skinny?” Perhaps. But I know that that didn’t resolve our problems. It still hated me. It became jealous that I was getting smaller, and punished me accordingly. How can I trust what it says now? 
I end the night feeling OK. But that is the first time today that I felt anything above yuck about my thighs, about our relationship today. I’m still mad. Why couldn’t you have pulled yourself together earlier? How do I know that what it shows me in the heat of the hate isn’t true? It tries to make up with me, like now, showing me what I think could be real. But was before simply a misunderstanding? Or was that the one moment of clarity?
I want to break up. ♦

I’m leaving little pieces of my teen years at my high school. They’re falling to the ground as I drag my feet from class to class. They’re flowing from my pen as I smudge the ink on my notes.
“Are you even paying attention?”
Of course I am. How can I not? Not paying attention to this lecture would mean not knowing what to do on the test and we all know you can’t afford to fail any test your junior year. 
With that said, there’s still that lingering feeling of wanting to be doing something worthwhile instead of sitting in a classroom for six hours a day. I’m sure some of my peers have this feeling flowing through their veins. The ones who say they’re going far far away after all this are usually the most fun to hang out with. That’s probably because people who have everything in order stress me out. When I talk to them I’m making a to-do list in my head of everything I need to do to catch up, which usually boils down to, “I’ll have it all done by my birthday.” Two months is plenty of time, right? ♦

I am walking down a lane of grey, away from the cathedral’s husk, and the air smells like the Goosebumps pages in the corner of my middle-school library. It is one of my favorite scents, and I favor the slight mustiness until it clears and the freshness of post-rain hits me. There is no shortage; I push my face out a bit more to let it merge with the coolness. The past hour dissipates, the air playing the platelets to my tipped bucket of blood, until I enter the familiarity of the station. An earnest return to dimness and delay.
I widen and refocus my eyes, trying to make them as sober as they can possibly be. I want out. I have this constant need to rush most things and this is one but it matters the most. I don’t know how to grasp for the right strands, and when I do my fingers tense up in silent self-sabotage. Everything eats me with haste. There is no way to protest without ripping open even more and showing the unpleasant marrow. I can’t remember the last time someone asked me to share more. ♦

I saw Eskimeaux and Cakes da Killa in the same night and I’m pretty sure that sums up who I am as a person. I went to see Eskimeux with my friend MK as a birthday celebration. We held hands to “Folly” and “A Hug Too Long” then danced for the for the rest of the set. After that, I met up with my friend Sy at the Cakes da Killa show. Seeing Sy after having to endure my white conservative school was like breathing after being held underwater for hours. I thought I’d died but I was revived by talking shit and dancing awkwardly with my one of my closest friends. We get super loud and talk 90 miles a minute when we’re together. People tend to stare at us because we some loud, cute black girls and they either love us or hate us. I’m pretty sure they wish they were us—able to exude such energy and flamboyance. 
Cakes da Killa is one of my favorite rappers because he’s so raw and open in his music. His lyrics are raunchy and can get very sexual, which I think is awesome especially since he’s a gay black man. Cakes isn’t afraid to be “extra” and I think that’s why I love him so much: I’m learning not to be so afraid of being the loud, opinionated black girl anymore. If people are intimidated by forwardness that’s their problem, not mine.
I had so much fun going from being super emo at the Eskimeaux show to jumping around and screaming “I will point a bitch out / Who the fuck coming realerrr?” It was liberating! I was dreading having to go back to my boring close-minded campus. I wish I was at a city school so I could have access to events like these all the time. I shouldn’t have to plan my moments of happiness around expensive train rides to the city and whether or not I’ll make it back to campus on time. I really wanna get out of here. I’m gonna keep looking for schools. ♦

I’ve been thinking a lot about my meeting with my therapist, mainly about how concerned she was about all the extra stress in my life. Recently, what I’m most stressed about is my school work, and since lacrosse has started, I’ve been struggling to keep up. 
My lacrosse practices are 7-9 PM three days a week, which is right around the time I would usually start doing my work. I’ve been trying to work between the time I get out of school and practice, but it’s hard because I usually want to hang out with friends. By the time I get home after practice, I’m tired and I just want to go to bed. 
My therapist is saying maybe I should quit lacrosse, and she’s probably right because I don’t really enjoy it. I guess I’m good at it, but my coach makes it really difficult (me and her clash a lot). I’m mostly there for all the friends I’ve made, which is what’s most important to me. I’ve been playing with these girls since freshman year, and I’ve always wanted to have something that I could say I did for all four years of high school—I planned on playing next year, too. But with junior year being the most important for my grades, it doesn’t seem realistic. I already have issues with attention and getting work done, and it’s hard to juggle everything without feeling stressed. The solutions for lacrosse are all out of my control, like having earlier practice or getting a new coach. Right now I don’t really know what I’m gonna do, but the longer I wait, the more guilty I feel. ♦

“I work so hard,” I say with my head in my hands.
I work so hard. I know no limits and often, fun becomes work. Then it turns back into fun again, for a little while. I barely watch TV anymore, usually only while I am eating. Once I’m done munching, I find no more use in sitting down and doing nothing. Recently, I have found that I just can’t watch TV. My body won’t let me. This reminds me of a commercial I saw during the 2012 Olympics, for the Olympics, in which a biker expresses the intensity of his training by saying “You know that hot new movie that everyone has seen? I haven’t even heard of it.” I say that I’m dedicated.
I don’t really shop anymore. I peruse the American Apparel online sale, only sometimes, when it’s half off of the already sale price, but I miss being inside a shop. I say that I’m becoming thrifty. 
I have a bookshelf choked with new novels. I get anxious about them, unmoving, that they will begin to decompose into the wooden desk and sprout up around it like tragic weeds that didn’t get to tell their stories. Having them there is also a bit of a comfort, knowing that when I finish this indefinite task, I will have a bed of colorful words to fall into. I say that I’m looking forward to something.
I work so dang hard.
I check my grades. My numbers, I call them.
I say nothing. ♦

“It is so stupid to look for a present that is red in color, while your country is sinking in blood.”
This was a note that a friend of mine from my stricken city in Syria recently sent to me. I tried to ignore it, as I decided to celebrate Valentine’s Day this year. I bought a red present, prepared a nice dinner and cake, decorated my room with red balloons, and lit red candles, while my husband went to get red flowers. I wanted to celebrate. I wanted to live a moment that I had never experienced before. I wanted to live those Valentine’s moments like other people live them. I tried to force happiness into my life but, unfortunately, I failed. Once I’d finished, I sat and looked around me, and I do not know what happened to me but the red color reminded me of the massacres that have taken place in my city.
A series of horrifying scenes started rolling through my mind. I tried to stop myself from going any further, and I tried really hard to control my feelings, but I could not. The image of my father drowning in his blood dominated my mind and my soul. In the middle of all of this, my husband entered the room with flowers in his hands: I think the noise woke me up from my nightmare and I just screamed. He was worried about me, but when he asked me what was going on, I couldn’t tell him. I felt that I had hurt him. He’d tried really hard to bring happiness into my soul that day, so I decided to mask my sadness and continue our celebration.
I find it very strange. Despite all the decorations and preparations, I could not enjoy that day. Have I grown so accustomed to sadness that I search for it and create it when I do not find it? I cannot tell what is happening, but I believe that my heart is still back there in my home city. I cannot live in happiness while I know that its people are dying. I cannot celebrate Valentine’s Day with roses, while I know that roses there are used to say goodbye to those being buried every day. Red roses represent blood and death, not love and celebration. It is not fair to celebrate while my people live in constant pain. Every time I tell myself that I have finally healed, something like this happens, and I realize that I am far away from healing.
Let me stop talking about that day, and let me tell you about my studies here in Switzerland. I feel safe here, especially in my home. Actually, we are looking for a new place in Bern that is closer to my school and to my husband’s work. I have been working really hard, hoping to eventually continue my studies and find a job. In studying, I also find a way to escape from my painful past. I try to keep myself busy, because every time I pause for a moment, I recall the past, and I drown in sadness. Although I still don’t speak the language, I try, with some help from my husband, to get to know my neighbors. They are very kind people, and I have joined them in some of their celebrations.
My days pass normally, but I am not alright. I thought that I left my suffering behind me the moment I arrived in Switzerland and married the person I love, but it seems like the memories of my past are stronger than me. I do not know how I will continue with my life like this. I’m scared that what I’ve been through will ruin me, my life, and my relationships with those around me.
Fear dominates me. Will I ever enjoy a day without fear? But how will that ever happen when I discover new fears every day? After what happened on Valentine’s Day, I am afraid that lying to my husband might become a habit. I am afraid that, only because I love him a lot, I might lie to him so that he does not realize how sad I am. What happened to the girl who used to scream, cry, and rebel whenever she wanted or needed to? Life is very strange and harsh. ♦

I stare at my white lace train and think, What has my week been? I move like a bored, civil wife with her gears always turning. No path has struck me as fully-formed enough to take, and I wonder if I am to blame or if my projections are prophecy. This doesn’t stop me from moving but it keeps my pace tight and caged. It’s alright. My songs of captivity are always the prettiest. 
But when does it stop being alright? I don’t want to look down one day to find that I am legs made of molasses and a ribcage in decline. On Wednesday, my therapist yelled at me for being stubborn. My problem is that I move too quickly out the window and too slowly in the street; my in-betweens are reserved. In the past few days I have tried to shape up and it has gone well but I do not know how long this will last. For once—really, and I can’t promise this enough—I am trying to stay in the present and not shoot ahead. No matter what, I must stay grounded. I block out all the banshee calls around me and limit myself to my own patch of dirt. Not encroaching upon others and having my own squarely marked out plot of land in my mind where only I exist and only my thoughts can pop up and grow is the best thing that has ever happened to me. When I am this squarely solitary, it is so much easier to evade the trap of becoming sewn to another, especially when they tear madly at the threaded holes, when they sacrifice their fingertips to it just to get away from me. Especially when they reject the thread altogether. It’s worst in sharp bursts, the former the most. 
I am proud to have come this far but I still look down every day and see that I have never left the ditch. It was easier to ignore when my reaction didn’t become so visceral; my stomach hurts every time I think about it. Even now, I am nauseous. I do not think this will change but the universe loves to prove me wrong when I doubt long enough. I realize, in shock, that I kneeled at my bed and prayed every night as a child and that I never do now, but I do send out thoughts to God like little letters and one of them is, “I hope I’m wrong.” ♦

I am attached to Tyler, the Creator. Although it sounds extremely creepy, I can’t explain it any other way. Not only do I find his music extremely beautiful (my favorite song is “Find Your Wings”), I feel lost when I listen to him. He is in his 20s, sells beautiful clothes, makes great music, and is the person I’ve always wanted to be: spontaneous, fun, and cool. 
I find myself constantly questioning my coolness. I am always asking my sister if my hair or clothes look cool. I feel disheartened to know that this is the way the world is conditioning me. I hate that I am always looking for reassurance. If I like something so much, I shouldn’t need people to tell me it looks good. Right?
Tyler, the Creator gives me power and confidence. He wrote this: ‘If you don’t have any confidence let me be your fucking confidence,” on his Facebook. As I read those words, my eyes welled up and I felt strangely emotional. I felt like they encapsulated the way I feel in school, and how I have a need for someone to be confident for me, because I am really bad at it. It made me wish I knew Tyler the Creator, or could at least speak to him. But even though we can’t interact with each other, at least we live on the same planet. I know that sounds weird, but thinking like that is somewhat comforting for me.
I’m not that special. There are probably a million other teenagers who feel the same way I do. There’s a girl like me in California and a boy like me in Sweden. There’s a boy like me in Turkey and a girl like me in Spain. Even though I don’t know these people, I can feel their energy. We should start a band one day, if I can ever find them. ♦

This week, my therapist and I decided that I should take a break from lacrosse. It felt really good to get rid of something so stressful. My only fear was that I would quit and then all my other stressors would disappear and…that’s what happened! 
The past three weeks were really stressful because I needed to do so many assignments but now those have all passed and I don’t really have anything that I’m doing at school. Now I just have NOTHING to do, which is terrible because I’m so depressed and I have so much alone time. I’m not occupied with anything, and all the bad feelings can catch up to me now. ♦

My heart thumped as the crowd roared to life. My feet automatically jived with the strumming of guitars and the booming bass lines. There they are, Death Cab for Cutie, in the flesh. Of course they’d pick “No Room in Frame” as the first song in the set because it starts off, “I don’t know where to begin…” It was an obvious witty move, but it still came as a pleasant surprise. Ben was prancing round, looking immaculate under the flashing halogen lights. I immediately fell in love with the scene, how everything on that stage was pulsing, and everyone looked so good, and sounded so good, though for a second I thought they sounded strange. I think I blacked out? Though not really. But I was sure I fell under the spell of this band I used to only listen to through headphones. It was unbelievable, to find myself scream-singing with Death Cab for Cutie, SHRIEKING really, in that cramped, sweaty, hot, uncomfortable space. 
The crowd was singing along, too, which now comes as a surprise as I call to mind a conversation I had with D when he noted that most concert goers don’t get to bask in an event’s atmosphere anymore because they’re constantly looking at screens, recording everything. But also because I thought, YAY I’M NOT ALONE! OK! I’m thankful to note now, as I’ve been there firsthand, that maybe this inclination is triggered by human beings’ general fear of losing something, an inability to move on and get into what has happened and what is here. We always want to have something to look back on, of course: It hurts to forget. And maybe in the process of forgetting—of a memory dissolving—something within us dissipates, too.
The day after the festival, I met up with a friend. We talked and roamed around Manila, a city I’m vaguely familiar with. I felt like a tourist, but not quite, because I spoke the same language as the locals. I’m thankful for Death Cab for Cutie playing the song “You Are a Tourist,” which has gotten me through tough and lonely times in cities I was altogether terrified of. Since it would hurt to forget this experience, here are snippets I’ll save. Conversations ending in “me, too!” reminding me to stop overlooking others’ presence and thinking that I’m all alone. Epiphanies that affirm my place in the world: I’m meant to be overly sentimental and melancholic and I should STOP BITCHING ABOUT IT. Looking into people’s eyes and finding #thelook that lets you know they, too, are terrified and insecure, or bored, or lost. Lastly, even though this may sound like a TED talk (sorry!), the sheer simplicity and magic of asking. ♦

I don’t hear the words in my head anymore. This worries me only because those words, the inner dialogue and commentary, have been a driving force in how I experience the world around me. Maybe it’s something of writer’s block. For my 19th birthday, now behind me, I wanted to compose a series of essays along with photos about this new phase I was reaching in life. All I have to show for this idea is little thoughts scribbled in one of those composition notebooks from the dollar store with the grainy paper. I began to think I couldn’t flesh out my thoughts because I was using cheap paper or the wrong pens. $40 spent in McNally Jackson and two months later, I have nothing more than I did that brisk night on Prince Street. 
All I’ve ever known how to do was write. Even when I resented that, rebuking in the name of Jesus my inability to sing, it was still fact. I always had these very intense spells where I’d daydream and come back with fresh ideas and perspectives. Ready to put them to paper, always wanting to share with the world. Toni Morrison once said writing was her way to see the world she lived in. That always resonated with me, except I wanted to be seen in the world I live in. I took extra care to narrate my own movements, in hopes that was greater awareness in who I was. It worked, I’ve developed a strong sense of self. I was ready to express all of this in my series of essays. We’re in the midst of a renaissance—one that is black in nature. I want to be prolific. I want to contribute. I hate writing, but I love having a voice. And even hating it doesn’t matter when I remember the payoff. Which is shouting out, “I am here!” And someone shouting back, “I see you, girl!” 
Then, I just got tired. I am exhausted and writer’s block has a hold on me. I struggle with this on a daily basis because I am trapped in an odd place I can’t even ARTICULATE. I need to be able to articulate it, describe it, understand it before I can get out of it. I am scared. I am scared that I’m going to be revealed as someone with no talent. No voice, nothing to give, when that’s all I ever wanted. When I see that long stretch of road between who I am and who I long to be, I’m not usually intimidated by it. I’m not sure I can say that anymore. You get glimpses at greatness, but when I think of how little I’ve progressed in the past couple of years, I tailspin into straight up depression. I feel like I’m always repeating myself. Living in the twilight zone begins to take it’s toll. I have very little to look forward to anymore. 
Nothing excites me. I am rapidly outgrowing my environment without having the option to leave. Everything is bland, except my nana’s food. I don’t like any of my friends anymore. Every time we engage in conversation, I have to remind myself to put on my caring face. Most days, I want to cry about it, but my tears won’t teleport me to a better place. I want to walk out of this college, not with a diploma but with a manuscript of some sort. A blueprint, a golden ticket, a brilliant idea. I know I am capable of all of these things. I know I can do it. I’m a star, right? So why can’t I seem to live up to that? 
Don’t feel too bad for me. It’s important to note that I have a flare for the dramatic—come through, self awareness!—but I don’t think that should undermine my current outlook. I just emote very hard, each feeling is felt with every fiber of my being, and they amplify themselves until sometimes I want to scream. I’ll pretend this is a mark of genius, but the fact is, I’ll probably have changed my tune by next week. Something great will happen and I will be flying high. I always operate in between those two spaces, flying high and feeling MEH about everything. Sometimes, all at once. Like, I got a new gig that I can’t allow myself to be happy about for some reason. No. There’s a reason, because I’m ready to soar and I’m not sure if this position is helpful yet. To be fair, I typed all of that above, took a shower, and now I feel way better, but the overarching fact of being trapped remains. I hope I soar above that before I lose my fucking mind. ♦

I’ve been thinking about the lyrics in the song “Heard ’Em Say,” by Kanye West. My favorite parts are: “Before you ask me to get a job today / Can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?” and “Things we see on the screen are not ours /… / But they can’t cop cars without seein’ cop cars / I guess they want us all behind bars. I know it.” This song shows me of how distant dreams can be from reality. It reminds me of how the go-to mantra for a kid is “believe in your dreams!” But once they’re adults, they find out that it’s not that easy. But just because it’s difficult to do so, doesn’t mean it’s not possible. This is a big dilemma for me that my brain is almost always trying to process: If you see me sitting in silence, I’m either thinking about this scenario or singing the lyrics of Spice Girls “Say You’ll Be There,” in my head.
I’ve also been getting emotional over the treatment of black people, not only in America, but all over the world. Although I live in the UK, I constantly see the names of Tamir Rice and Sandra Bland and it hurts my heart to see how unsafe and backwards our society is. We can’t bring these people who were killed by officers abusing their power and status back.
Although it is most probably unlikely, I would love to live in a peaceful world. It doesn’t seem like much to ask for. Sometimes, I forget that I live on a planet, which is in space. Thinking about it makes me feel…nostalgic. ♦

Her name was carved into the table, I ran my fingers across, following the curves of each letter. Delicately, like a whisper, a flume of smoke drifting toward the sky and disappearing in an instant. The waves lapped against the shore as we swam, it was a summer afternoon and you smiled at me. It was a secret smile that dissolved my heart. Every time we exchange a look I feel like I am standing on a cliff’s edge—about to fall, about to break into a million pieces. I never know whether to give you my hand and pull you in, or flee, run as fast as I can.
It’s easy to lay there next to you as you tell me the dreams you had last night, but then you ask me and I lie. Because telling you that even in my subconscious you are all I know and all I feel and all I need, well, thats too much. I’m always too much. I am an abundance of pain, and a sharpness that never subsides. I am the very bottom of a pit of darkness that goes on for thousands of miles. I am quiet tears and awkward winks; you are a croak of laughter and a knowing smirk. Sometimes this works, other times I think we should float away and forget that we are perfect. ♦

I was to walk across stage and accept the official certificate that inducted me into National Honors Society. I was sitting in the car. It was 6:52. The ceremony was to start at 7:00. My hair was dry and wild and short. It looked like straw that’d been struck by lightning and blackened. Pigment from the dye clung to my forehead, my eyes red and puffy from hysterical crying. The clippings of my hair clung to my chest, and my face was oily from the anxious minutes I’d spent in the salon chair. I was quite the sight. And I was late. I sobbed. I was not going to make it.
I called my mom, begging for her forgiveness and mercy. I expected her to be upset I’d come to the ceremony much later than my call time of 6:15, but that was not her concern. She was adamant I go inside. God no, I would not go inside.
She left me no option, so I cried more and then honked so she could find me in the parking lot. She and my father consoled me and I cried more. We walked toward the auditorium and I cried more. On the way, my mother delivered to me some altered version of Nas’ “The World Is Yours,” in speech form. And then she told me to look at the sky and all its stars and the lack of debris falling from it. And for a second, I did feel like the world was mine, and maybe my hair didn’t matter.
But it did. It so did.
We went inside the auditorium, and I made the mistake of going to the bathroom to look at myself one last time. There was more crying. I found my seat in the program, and about 30 minutes later, I walked across the stage with an awkward half-smile and a spring in my step. I had to be out of public sight as soon as possible. No one could ask me what I’d done to my precious, previously beautiful hair, no one could even know.
At some point, I decided this event would be the topic of my college essay. My overcoming of this first-world challenge attested to my will to try, despite my lack of confidence. The lack of confidence that propelled me out of the doors, and through the post-ceremony reception, and back into the car, to drive home, where I cried some more.
I had been ugliest girl at the Nerd Oscars. What a shame. ♦

Despite the terror that they have witnessed back home, all refugees here, regardless of their origins, miss their families and feel nostalgic for their homelands. We have left our homes, hoping for a safe life and a better future. Although in Europe we enjoy safety and stability, we all miss our homelands, families, and friends.
The initial period after refugees arrive in Europe is usually the hardest. We all feel lost because most of us do not speak European languages and do not have jobs. Many refugees feel that they have lost a part of themselves—back home we had our own communities, our jobs, our families and friends, but in fleeing to Europe we we’ve lost all of that.
I, for example, feel that deep inside me there is a void. I sometimes wish I had stayed in Syria, despite the war. I know that you might be shocked by my words because you know how much I suffered in order to come here, but believe me, there is a gap in everybody’s soul that only one’s own homeland can fill.
I have married, and now I have a new home to build, but every time I think about the fact that my mother and siblings will move to Germany, anger and fear boil inside me. More and more I feel lost. Although my husband has stood by my side and supported me in the face all these obstacles, my anger and fear get the best of me sometimes.
I have lost all of my safety nets; family, school, community, and homeland. I am even giving away my own traditions and gradually embracing those of Switzerland. The two cultures are very different, and in order for me to take part in this society, I have to cope. However, I am afraid that I will eventually lose my identity, and that I will not know how to fill the void that losing it might create. I thought that as soon as I left Syria and arrived in Europe, everything would magically work out, but I was wrong. Life is an endless chain of problems.
Every time I feel anxious, I close my eyes and think of my father and my grandparents. Is this an escape strategy? Is this a sign of weakness?
Other times, I remind myself that I’ve received everything I hoped for, and that I should be strong. I remind myself that I am in a great place, and with someone who loves me. I’m lucky. This makes me feel better for a little while, but eventually, I sink back into my concerns. What do I want? I sometimes fail to understand myself.
For a while after I got married, I enjoyed being taken care of. But recently, I’ve begun to change. By depending on my husband for everything, I was undermining my own control of myself and my life. I want us to be equal. I want to act as his partner. I know that he has much more life experience than me, but I am working hard, and I am learning something new every day.
I needed time to get used to my new life. Now, however, I am ready to rethink my behavior, my approach to life, and my mistakes. I am very happy with where I am now, and I hope that everything will eventually settle. There is one thing that I pray for: I pray that my family will remain next to me. Will I be able to realize this dream? ♦

The first day I lost my sanity was a Wednesday, there was snow on the ground, the air was crisp and sweet. I could feel my heart expanding in my chest. Today is a Monday and I’ve lost what was left of my sanity. It wasn’t lost, my mistake, it was stolen, along with my heart. Most people have things stolen in the middle of the night by a masked person carrying a brown sack. But you abducted my heart at 3:55 PM while I was busy working. You ran away with it using just your words, written probably while you lay in bed.
I left a trail of breadcrumbs from your soul to mine, in the hope that you would follow them, like no one else could. But you didn’t, you stood there and stared as the crows picked up each fragment, one by one. Until what was left? Me alone, standing under a ladder—just to reaffirm my bad luck.
I’ve tried to wrap up my heart in bubble wrap, wearing layers upon layers and my thickest winter coat, but look where I am. Alone and stuck to the idea that you could save me from the looming pain my life brings me. But that was never your job so I can’t blame you. ♦

I can’t wait to go to the park and cry after school. 
When did it become so heavy to walk to class? Or, I suppose, when did it start becoming heavy again? I didn’t realize my lightness until nothing is light anymore. It’s sounds dramatic because it is dramatic. 
I can look at the street from my second period window. I do look at the street. I don’t care about trouble! Just let me go home. I’ll let myself go home. If only I could get up. I am going to walk far far far. But I have to get up. 
My soul is kind of drowning so it decides to leave without me. It hurts but I can’t get up. Take care. 
I like to drop hints but immediately employ my default smile and “what?” after “what’s wrong?” I can’t help myself. I think I want someone to break that barrier and tell me that they know. Tell me that you know, and tell me what to do, and hug me. ♦

My friend Chris was turning 17, and to celebrate he was having a party-type thing at the cemetery (that sounds weird, but kids go to hang out at the cemetery; it’s really nice up there), and then moving on to another friend’s house. The party was Friday, and I really wanted to go for the whole thing, so I arranged to stay the night at my friend Jasmine’s. It seemed like everything was gonna go fine. 
On Thursday morning, I got in a fight with my dad. It wasn’t anything huge that happened, but I felt myself about to get really angry, so I tried calming down by listening to some music. My dad knows that’s one of my strategies, and he’s usually understanding because we’ve been working on my temper. But he decided to keep messing with me, which obviously made me even angrier. I didn’t want to lose my temper and ruin the plans I had for Friday, and I didn’t want any hard feelings between me and my dad. But he kept annoying me, and from that point on things got worse and worse. 
My dad had already said I could stay at Jasmine’s, but after our argument, he said I couldn’t. I was really mad; I wanted to go SO bad. So, on Friday morning when he texted me and to say he was gonna pick me up right after school, I pushed back until he said he’d pick me up at 6:30 PM. Except that wasn’t enough, so I took it a step further and told him that if he didn’t let me go he would regret it, and feel “beyond upset.” I was hinting at hurting myself, and in retrospect, I can see how that’s fucked up, but I was already in a bad mood and this party was the only thing that was going to make me feel better. (I also think it’s kinda funny that I learned about using suicide as a threat from my therapist.)
I didn’t hear from my dad after that, and I didn’t really think much of it. Later, my mom told me to call her. When I did she was really angry, and told me, “You can’t say things like that!” I was still upset so I didn’t care—and I think I still don’t really care. Maybe because I think about death so often that it doesn’t really bother me. I just used it to get something I wanted because I figured my parents wouldn’t want to risk it. My mom ended up picking me up after school for what I thought would just be a talk. But she drove me to the hospital! I suppose she was super convinced that I was going to do something. Going there really freaked me out. I know kids who have gone to the hospital for this sort of thing and haven’t come out for a super long time. I was screaming and crying and having an ultimate fit; the nurses had to drag me out of the car. 
Even though I was in the hospital for hours, part of me still hoped I could make it to the party, but I didn’t. When we finally left, my parents decided to take my phone, for some reason I don’t understand. They said I need to take responsibility for my actions which I think is hypocritical because this thing never would have escalated if it weren’t for my dad. I also don’t think cutting me off from a whole bunch of things like my friends and schoolwork is the right way to respond to a suicide threat. Not having a phone stresses me out. At least my parents are stupid enough to let me use the iPad mini they gave me. It can do anything my phone does, I even have it set up to receive texts, so it’s almost like I have my phone. I look at this as me being able to adapt easily; I know how bad it would have been if I was completely cut off. 
I’m not in hospital now, but I think I still need psychiatric help. I know it’s not right to be so nonchalant about death. I’m upset about my parents’ response. I think maybe I was flippant because I vowed I wouldn’t kill myself when I’m 17, so saying I would really didn’t mean that much to me. Mostly, though, I’m pissed that I’ve only been 17 for a week but I’ve already messed up. ♦

No one told me how easy it was to be influenced by my peers. I guess they wanted me to wait to find out for myself, so that I could ruin all of my best features trying to fit in.
I’m Turkish Cypriot, and like many of my compatriots, I’ve had curly hair since I was a baby. I’ve never wanted straight hair. But now, as a self-conscious girl in year 9 (aka 8th grade) who goes to a predominately white Anglo school, I feel like I’m starting to feel the tug of the majority. 
This past week, I straightened my shoulder-length, super curly hair and went into school. And as I walked into class on Monday, I felt a change in the way I was being treated. The “cool” girls in my year group were complimenting me and none of the boys picked on me. Being the naïve person that I am, I thought it was just a coincidence. But it wasn’t; every day I went into school with straight hair I was treated much better than I am usually. People would rather treat a girl with straight hair nicely, as opposed to a girl with curly hair?!
Knowing this is the rule annoys me, but I can’t say that I didn’t enjoy how nicely people treated me. All of the “popular” boys—with their ’90s curtain haircuts—were actually nice to me. My peers actually engaged me in conversation.
It’s tempting to give in to peer pressure, or the pressure to conform, but I really don’t want to ruin the texture of my hair just because people are treating me better. When I go to school on Monday, with my hair curly, I’ll have to remember how much I love my natural state. And that I’m lucky to have that love to guard me from the years of hair-destruction I could’ve faced. 
By the way, I’m definitely not dissing anyone who straightens their hair. If you’re into it, go for it! It’s just not my thing. I know that soon, I’ll find people who will appreciate me as I am. ♦

Dear Guidance Counselor,
As you know, the junior packet asks me to explain any grades I feel I may be of issue when applying to college. The only grade I really need to explain is the inevitable C I will get in chemistry this year, and for that, I must inform you of something. 
The day I was supposed to take my chemistry midterm, I began feeling extreme pain and was rushed into surgery. The next day, many of my relatives called me and said they were happy things hadn’t been worse, that I hadn’t died. I didn’t even know I could’ve died. In fact, the day I had surgery, all I could think about was the fact I was missing my chemistry midterm. And that sparked the realization. If I had died, it wouldn’t have mattered that I’d never the taken the test, or gotten an inevitable C in the class, because I’d be dead.
I could die at any moment. I could die before I finish this little note. Boom. Gone forever. My transcript isn’t going on my tombstone. And part of that has to do with my plan to be cryogenically frozen, but more importantly is that no one’s grades are meticulously sorted through whence they die, or remembered past junior packet grade explanations.
I will get a C in chemistry this year. Primarily because I am bad at science, but more so because I realized I didn’t need to be good.
All the best,
Simone Rembert ♦

Spare me the lectures about what I could have been doing or should have done. I know all of those things. Up until this point, I’ve been a decent kid saving up disappointment cards for the day I finally fuck up. And Friday, right before spring break, I found that I had indeed done so. My mom has been having health issues, so I had missed a decent amount of classes due to being in doctor’s offices with her. This was my choice entirely, she feels that I have my own life to live, one that doesn’t include taking care of her. Yet, I feel indebted to my mom. Not in a negative way, but she is the end all be all of my existence. I’m not being dramatic here, she’s taught me all I know. We’re extremely close. “Just Us” by Two Tons of Fun played in the background when we reunited after I’d come home from break. 
Anyway, I’d been missing classes, but my professor had assured me I’d be OK. Only to tell me she wants me to withdraw from her class! I was devastated. Earlier in the semester I’d dropped playwriting (a class I was really excited for!) to keep up with the workload in her class. This put me down to eight credits, two classes, and initially, my financial aid in jeopardy. Luckily for me, my nana is a praying woman and I just have to take an online class this summer to recover the credits. I was on one hand relieved, to get a “W” on my transcript is much better than an “F” which is the direction I was heading in. On the other hand, this is my first time being in a predicament this dire. 
I am not a great college student. It’s not because I’m not capable, it’s because I’m unenthused. I am looking forward to taking interesting classes in the Fall, but I can barely make it through the spring! My need to look ahead, essentially having something to live for, comes to my own detriment at times. I’m having an uptick in my professional life. My social life is pretty cool, too. I spend a lot of time doing cool things, networking, taking “business meetings,” and my schoolwork has taken a backseat to that. However, when I talk to people at my school who are filling out grad school applications because they decided not to lay down the foundation of their futures at an earlier age, I feel some weird validation that, to some degree, I’m doing the right thing. 
As a result, I’ve decided that I’m not going to stop being a hustla, homie. I’m going to buy a planner, the ones soccer moms have in their Longchamp bags. If they can balance PTA meetings with “Connor’s big kickoff,” I can do what I’m supposed to do. People work numerous jobs while putting themselves through school. Having the immense support system I have means the excuses I have are limited. I can have my cake and eat it too, right? I just have to find the boundaries between working for a better future and sabotaging my shot at being the first woman in my immediate family with a degree. That matters not only to me, but to my family, and I owe them that at least. ♦

Good Friday coincides with my father’s birthday like an eclipse and I forget to say anything to him even though my instincts want me to write to him. When I wake up the next day, my cousin reminds me and I remember that he did not wish me one on my 16th birthday. I feel worse than I did before. 
My head feels like a mine, every ounce of energy a pick in its rubble, but I cannot see the men whose hands I’m at the mercy of. Problem after problem. Like minor fables they accumulate, until my anthology is thick enough to meet the soles of God. I look to the rose and say: “Show me the truth underneath all the tissue.” I look to the thyme and say: “Let me trap the lucidity that keeps me in my pain in my dreams.” I look pleadingly to the bloodroot, steeping it in the wine, and say: “Let me be free of my transgressions.” 
Some boy tells me that my poetry is important. I don’t trust him. Even if I pretended I did, there are too many pages in my own handwriting, working through lessons on how to spoil visages and reveal the source of telling blood. I know what I have to do. ♦

I told myself that I didn’t want to complain to you this time. So I won’t. In the midst of this Spring Break Depression, I have found my mind carrying my body places that it probably wouldn’t have gone otherwise. My upstairs has the power to obliterate me; it can also make me believe that I can run four miles again, and promptly directs my body to do so.
It’s not fun. My body despises running. My mind loves it. So that’s what we do, us three. It’s glorious when I use my inhaler right and death doesn’t seem imminent upon every little incline. I can pretend that it’s working, just so I can get over the hill. I used to have flashbacks about cross country running. I didn’t understand why running had become so hard when I’d been trained to run for so long; anxiety paves the lungs like cement.
Unlike the other worlds I live in, running just wants me to get to one place. The return. Just be a boomerang. At some point, I started doing so much hard stuff that I sacrificed the pain of running just to be doing a simple task again. Also, it’s so natural. Just you and your body (and that dang mind). ♦

Ever since I heard about its exquisite natural terrain and its gorgeous ancient buildings, I have always wanted to visit Turkey. And now, in the most unexpected of times, I finally got the chance to enjoy the beauty of this country. 
Turkey was the first stop on our long, illegal journey to Europe. We stayed with some relatives in the European part of Istanbul, and I immediately fell for this magical city. We first visited the Eyup Sultan Mosque, a masterpiece of decoration and construction, which includes the mausoleum of Aby Ayyoub al-Ansari, one of the Prophet Muhammad’s companions. We then took chairlifts to the Pierre Loti Hill, from where we enjoyed the spectacular view of the Golden Horn waterway. After we’d had hot drinks and Turkish bread, we headed back down to the coast, where we watched the ferries, boats, and ducks. The view amazed me and I felt neither the time passing nor the cold weather. 
The next day, my relatives took me to Taksim Square, which is a major tourist and leisure district, famed for its restaurants, shops and hotels. It also contains a monument portraying Kemal Atatürk. We walked in Istiklal Street—which houses various boutiques, cafes and stores, and has a historic tram—and visited the Galata Tower. From there, we went to the Eminönü neighborhood, where we saw a beautiful bridge teeming with fishermen and great seafood restaurants. We took a ferry to the neighborhood of Uskudar, on the Asian side of the city, and spent some time in a park with a beautiful view of the Bosphorus. 
My relatives also took me to the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, to Hagia Sophia—which was a church, and then a mosque, and is now a museum—and to Gülhane Park and the gorgeous castle next to it. Everything I saw was utterly spectacular. We walked a little, and entered a covered bazaar that reminded me a lot of the al-Hamidiyya bazaar in Damascus.
I do not even have words to describe Turkey. It has everything: Beautiful natural terrain, amazing architecture, delicious Syrian-like food, fish, chocolate, and even dolphin exhibits. I am dazzled by this country and I wish that I did not have to leave. 
As much as I enjoyed this tour, I was preoccupied with my dangerous journey to Europe. I kept asking myself, Is this the last place I will ever visit? Tomorrow, I will get on a rubber boat and head to Greece. This beautiful place might be the last that I will ever see. Or it might be the beginning of a new life and many new beautiful places. 
I am scared of tomorrow’s journey. I’m not scared that I might die in the sea. What scares me is that I do not know what to expect and I do not know what’s in store for me. Is it heaven? Or is it hell? Wish me luck on my coming journey. ♦

The second semester is in full swing, and with it comes the urge to get my shit together! My grades last semester were nothing short of atrocious, and after a session of swinging into the air, à la Cuba Gooding, Jr. in Boyz in the Hood, I got a fucking clue. I realize that as I begin to mature, no one is going to care about circumstances. They want to see the work. That’s exactly what I need to be doing, rolling up my sleeves and getting it done. I’d say that I’m not gonna complain while doing the work, but I‘d be lying. This “work” includes personal projects I’m dying to complete, self-teaching coding, and writing assignments for my playwriting class. I can’t let the kids in that class show me up, which is what will happen if I half ass it like I do most things. I went to drop the class, but then I realized that I can’t run from everything because of difficulty level.
It’s a seminar style class and experience varies. We have kids in there who have written plays and had them produced within the local New York theater community. You have the kids who don’t write within the confines stage demand, but who write narrative fiction and essays—they want to dip their toes into this new field. Then, you have absolute novices, who are holding their heads high despite the experience others have. For me, I’m taking this class because of a conversation that took place over winter break. My friend in acting school expressed that she was over the lack of diversity in theater and film, of always being assigned the Beneatha Monologue, and just wanting something new. I had always wanted to create scripts to some degree, but had gotten distracted or come up with a litany of excuses as to why I couldn’t. In this class, I’m being forced to do the work. I want to pass, and to pass I have to produce a play. 
When she first walked into the classroom, I thought the teacher was a student. She’s really young, but established nonetheless. She wore a knitted sweater and motorcycle boots, as if she’s living on the edge, but not before she slowly sips on chai tea and invents new characters. I looked around at the faces in the class. We were a pretty “diverse” bunch. (What is diversity anyway, other than a catchall phrase?) I was sensing some real attitude from one of the girls in the class, but that’s a diary entry for a later date. We engaged in icebreakers, which always suck. And then almost immediately, we started writing. I hate these writing exercises to “get the juices flowing,” I don’t think they really benefit anyone but I am not a playwriting professor. 
“Off the top of your head, write down thing you’re obsessed with and then share them.” That’s where things got weird and murky. I thought the meaning of “off the top of your head” was widely understood, but then you realize that in some way everyone here is trying to outdo everyone else. My answer was pretty straightforward, the first thing that popped into my mind: Michael B. Jordan. This answer paled in comparison, it was scoffed at: I had been branded a fangirl incapable of thinking on an artistic level. I see nothing wrong with name dropping Michael, while others name dropped Kierkegaard. I’ve noticed here, that the more people try to make obscure references to shit that’s not really that obscure, the more mediocre that person’s work is. They have to overcompensate with knowledge, but often never have anything on the page and mope and whine that they’re misunderstood. 
Other answers were like, “I’m obsessed with making my parents happy.” Seems pretty legitimate. Then, there are those creative writing majors and disciples of Didion. They, funny enough, don’t name their literary aspirations as points of obsession. Obsession in the professional sense isn’t wanted, it’s all about the art. Sacrificing for the art. Being transparent for the art. Some other generic response they picked up in a Marina Abramović interview. Rather we get long drawn out answers like, “I’m obsessed with boys who are emotionally unavailable. I visited him one day in that barren town, barren like his soul, and his unkempt hair was everywhere, like the thoughts pitter pattering in my prefrontal cortex.” Someone is cheating. 
There were few interesting answers, but I’m not easily impressed by anything really. I scrunched up my face in “chile, what the fuck?” when, when rattling off the things that he was obsessed with, my Anglo Saxon compatriot nonchalantly said, “black people.” I could’ve used some elaboration on that but do I really want it? We have one REAL weirdo in the class. I mean, all narratives are valid and whatever other political correct thing I’m supposed to say, however her brand of comedy isn’t funny. She claims she’s accomplished and has notebooks full of jokes. She’s trying for Broad City but keeps entering no man’s land. The two-person scene about a man asking a woman in Chipotle to cum in her socks wasn’t pushing the boundaries she thought it was. 
In short, I never want to go back to that class again. I didn’t feel very welcome. I mean, the monologue about a teenage girl liking her local barista done in botched valley girl with ratchet peppered in was enough to turn me away. However, I’m stuck. The class is four hours and the assignments are aplenty. I can do it…I guess. Not to toot my own horn but I can do better than cumming in socks. I’m not gonna flip the script and write plays that these people want to hear. I’m not gonna write longwinded existential prose during the writing exercise to impress the professor. I’m going to just BE. Which is something I’m actively striving for this semester. ♦

One. I haven’t written anything in my journal in a week. It’s like, I share one entry with the world and now it spits at me, “Who are you to betray my trust?” 
“It’s my own trust,” I tell myself, bewildered. “It’s no betrayal.” I think about that dream I had where someone stole my journal and I stole it back and ripped all the pages out saying, “Forget, forget, forget,” like I could change the past. Did they even read it in the dream? I don’t remember. It’s not written down in the list whether they did or not. Need to have more dreams. Need to fill up the page. I’ll write it down in better detail next time, I think wildly, I won’t forget anything. But I always do. I know I’ve dreamed since then but everything fades too fast, gets eaten up by the blare of my alarm at six in the morning. I’ll set it for 6:10, I think. 10 extra minutes of dreaming. I’ll remember it that way, I think. I’ll have something to write about.
Two. “When are you coming back to open gyms?” she asks. 
“Soon,” I tell her, happiness rising in my gut. “Maybe this weekend.” 
She turns to me and she is skeptical. “So soon? Are you sure you’re ready? You don’t want to injure yourself this close to the season, do you?” 
I think about that for a moment. “You could apply that logic all the way up through the start of training,” I say lightly. 
“I guess so,” she says. She looks at me with dark eyes. In my stomach I can feel the joy and anticipation being eaten alive, swallowed up inside a skin of self-doubt. I don’t say anything else.
Three. I detach myself from everything that makes me feel more than I need to. Social networks, mostly. I wipe photos from my phone and go through file after file on my laptop, reclassifying them in a stark web of systematic numbers and underscores, everything in its place. My head is quieter than it has been in weeks.
Four. The gray flannel sheets trap my body heat the best. The air is cold outside of them but warm inside. When I stick out a hand to pull up my quilt the cold of the morning is still in the air. I stay where I am. In the other room there are voices and the sounds of people moving around. I can hear my brother’s footsteps in the kitchen. Unusual. I forgot he was home. They’re different from my mother’s—they’re heavier. They resonate. I stay where I am. Soon I get hungry, but ignore it. Curl up and try to sleep again instead. The clock ticks away another hour, two hours. I don’t sleep. I stay where I am. My dad’s shoes on the stairs. The house creaks as he comes downstairs. Everyone is up except for me. I stay where I am. The air is cold outside but warm inside. Usually I like the cold. I just don’t like the numb. I stay where I am. I don’t sleep but I’m too tired to do anything else. I stay where I am. I’m OK. I’ll sleep. I stay where I am. ♦

Tomorrow is school, a new semester. It will feel strange not to go to sleep at the break of blue morning but I will finally regain control of my off-track mind, sprouting up at the point between afternoon and evening. I have washed my hair and showered in lavender. Everything feels fresh and I wonder what my aura must look like. I ignore the heaviness I feel in all of my dreams and focus on clinging to the wake-up. 
My brief journal entries throughout the day, for my eyes only, have provided a new sense of boundary lines, a new place within myself to come and grow. In my mind, it is an all-white place, like a blank page, and a stick figure forest surrounds it in an arc. I don’t know how long my home there will last but I do not want to overthink it. The stars agree. 
Re-arch my back. Stretch out when I wake. I am part of a wash cycle with no end in sight. I cannot see far ahead enough. ♦

“Death Journey” is what I call our passage from Syria to Switzerland because of the misery, humiliation, and danger we faced. I do not even have words to describe it. It was a real confrontation with death and a struggle for survival.
We paid a smuggler a large amount of money to reserve places on a boat that would take us from Turkey to Greece. Our trip started on a rubber boat that launched from the shore of the city of Izmir, in Turkey. When we arrived to our point of departure, we were happy to see that the boat looked somewhat new, but the scary part came when we saw the number of people who got on it. The boat was designed to carry a maximum of 35 people, but there were 60 men, women, and children on it. We were really scared that it might sink, but it was our only hope to get out, and there was no way we could change our minds. 
The waves were very high. The boat was rocking and our hearts rocked with it. My family and I tried to be strong, and we stuck to each other, but hearing women and children screaming drained all our strength and courage. The rubber boat was navigated by one of the passengers, who clearly knew nothing about sailing. We kept turning around in the middle of the sea instead of moving forward. The smuggler had informed us that the trip to Greece would take us one hour and 15 minutes, but we spent four horrific hours in the middle of the sea, until we were finally spotted by the coastguard and members of the Red Cross, who instructed us on how to reach the shores of Greece. 
When we arrived, we were welcomed by people from UNICEF and the Red Cross. They transported us in cars to a nearby center of theirs, where we got to change our soaked clothes, and from there they took us to a refugee camp. The camp was a big disappointment. It was packed with people, and I could not find any available spot to rest, so I spent the day outside in the cold. I could not fall asleep that night. It was very cold and the blankets they had given us were not enough to keep us warm.
After they took our pictures and our fingerprints at the camp, they gave us a permission letter to leave. We headed to the port early because we thought that the ferry to Athens would leave in the morning, but when we arrived, we learned that it actually leaves at 8 PM, so we had to sit like beggars on the street for the whole day. We all had a cold. We were coughing and sneezing, and I was shivering from cold and horror at the same time. My journey started with nothing but misery, and I kept asking myself, “If the beginning was that bad, what else is in store for us?”
People from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and many other countries gathered to board the ferry. Of course, there were people from different countries traveling with fake Syrian passports, using the Syrian crisis as a way to reach Europe. It was very hard to get on the ferry, because of the sheer number of refugees, and because the Greek officers appeared to lack any organizational skills. My little sister was really sick, so after three hours of waiting and trying to get on the ferry in a civilized way, my mother finally decided to do what everyone else was doing; she started pushing our way in, but while in the middle of the crowd, my brother let go of her hand and disappeared. She lost her mind and we had to leave everything and look for him. Thankfully, he was pretty close and we found him right away, but he was scared and my mother almost went crazy. It was a challenging moment that I do not want to think of anymore.
It took us four hours to board the ferry. We were very tired and cold, but we finally found a warm place, and we all fell asleep for the entire seven-hour trip. We arrived in Serbia and then went on to Macedonia. The Red Cross transported us to Croatia and then to Slovenia. Each refugee camp we stayed at was worse than the last one. They all lacked organization and hygiene and, honestly, none of them was suitable for human beings. I always thought that humiliation was a unique thing that happened only in Syria, but I was surprised that even in Europe, the place where human rights are highly respected, we were treated like criminals and fugitives. 
In Austria, we were all subjected to an exhaustive search. I asked about the reason behind this treatment and someone mentioned that it was all because one of the guys who had participated in the Paris attacks had a Syrian passport. What I heard made me laugh and wonder: Why would a criminal carry his passport to his crime scene? 
When we left the car in Croatia, some officers sprayed pesticides inside the car to prevent diseases; that was by far the most humiliating and hurtful moment of our trip. I felt that I was very small. I felt that I had no value and that I was no more than a germ. However, some feelings of determination were emerging in me – I would prove to all these people that Syrians were much better than what they thought.
We went from Austria to Germany. In Germany, they took our fingerprints again, and we were forced to apply for asylum, although we made it clear that we did not want to. As soon as they let us out, we started our journey to Switzerland. We walked for a long time, until we reached the train station, where we boarded a train. We changed trains several times before reaching Basel, where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, and where our relative met us. We stayed with our relative for two days, and then we applied for asylum in one of the immigration centers in Lausanne.
Every country we passed through treated us like stray dogs. They gave us food, but they forgot that we were human beings and that we needed love and support. We had just left a war-torn country and all we needed was someone to be humane. I do not know who to blame for this—we have become homeless germs that spread disease. 
I will do everything I can to prove that Syrians deserve respect. I want to live with dignity and I hope that Switzerland is the beginning of a new journey. ♦

I’m obsessed with the idea of late nights, loud parties, 1 AM burger runs, and I keep requesting that we take day trips for my birthday. I’m constantly trying to recreate all my favorite teen movies. Clichéd, I know, but isn’t this my time to be a cliché? 
I think it should be, but trust me, it’s hard to have all those Teen Movie Moments when you always feel like you’re missing something. It’s kinda like falling down a ladder slowly: I start at the top with the perfect location and event, but then I don’t have the money to get there. When I do get the money together, no one else wants to accompany me. By now, I’m somewhere in the middle of the ladder. When I have the money and the friends, we don’t have a ride. By the time I have the ride, my friends have cancelled. And now I’m lying on the floor, with just the dream of the perfect day and my disappointment. 
I can’t wait until I’m in control of what I do and when I do it, because this whole wait-and-see thing just isn’t for me. ♦

I don’t understand organized sports. I never have and I don’t think I ever will.
The first, and most confusing thing, is the ownership which fans assume of their team. “My team.” “Our team.” Most devout sports fans I know are teenage boys or middle aged men. They are not professional football players. In no universe will they be. On no planet were they ever. And yet, they speak as though they were present in the athletic action, having a say in the strategy of play. I’d understand these verbal habits if organized sports worked in the way stocks did, and fans could buy shares in their team. In that case, one would literally own a part of the team, and so yes it would, in some form, belong to them. But it doesn’t work this way. Why the personal pronouns?
I understand the nature of wanting to experience something live, but think of all the wasted time, all of the missed opportunities. Televised sports come to a halt for commercial. Football stops every six or seven seconds. I cannot fathom the amount of time sports fans will spend in their lifetimes watching instant replays on loop.
There’s also the overzealous camaraderie of watching, or attending, or even talking about a sporting event. Why do people smashing their bodies into each other unite the masses in a far more effective way than beautiful music or literature? I think this says something about the human race.
But despite the so-called unifying effect of sports, we exclude women from the sphere? We discount their opinions and reactions to bandwagon thought. The hypermasculinity of sports makes for the exclusion of any non-heteronormative person. In my lifetime, I’ve witnessed the career of only one openly gay football player. And he’s the only openly gay football player ever. Fucked up if you asked me.
Of course, I sound hypocritical. Hollywood is to me what sports are to others. The Criterion Collection is my Hall of Fame. The Oscars are my Super Bowl. The problems of the two are very similar as well. The pundits insistent upon protecting the legacy of Peyton Manning against Cam Newton‘s newfound glory are like the Academy members who continuously ignore the achievements and mere existence of people of color. Both operate solely to maintain the traditional workings of a system—and flawed systems at that. 
But, despite all it’s glaring flaws, I love Hollywood. It is drama (and very enticing drama at that), it is art (occasionally), and it is personal. I guess sports offer those same things to people, too. ♦

I don’t weigh as much as I’d like to, especially in specific places—I need to gain. How many paragraphs have I started with this sentence? It’s endless and I hate it. That being said, I’ve written and rewritten this diary four times this week with no hint to its perfect form. Of all the terrors that have arisen in the past few days, the worst have definitely been my dreams. The only way I can get close to explaining the heart of them right now is with this song: “Bitten Into Sympathy” by the Melvins. It goes: 
I have the understanding and the tribal sense of true.
Bitten into sympathy and made to flex with you.
You control my weather and control behind my eyes.
Magnitude be simply simply simply simp.
The lies!
The lies!
I often go from having too little to say to having too much to say that’s too confidential to air out, especially in the moment of. Today I go from having very little grasp of my dreamscape to writing down two pages of last night’s/this morning’s happenings, and then realize that I can show neither of them to my therapist without heavy omission. It’s not worth it. But I don’t know how well I can comfort myself and decipher the recollection on my own. I consider all the familiar faces as I lay in the aftermath. I don’t know if I’m projecting or if they mean something in the vein of the future. 
I think about becoming a nun. I think about what he would say if I told him that. Probably not much. Why bother. If I told anyone this, they would never, even given eternity, believe me or understand why. I would gladly accept the papal paperweight. The mountainside hermeticism that haunts my mind. I don’t know how long it would realistically stick to me, but I try to imagine a world and time where it would. The distance from it is much harder to calculate.
I feel bad for not having more to say. Some somewhat fun facts: My favorite new line is “He’s somebody’s daughter” from “Lizzy” by the Melvins. I’ve been writing more but it’s harder to do so in my actual diary. Things keep popping up in my field of vision and I’m not sure whether or not I should believe some of them. I’m in a quite a bit of pain, actually.

In the spring I play two different roles. Right now I am playing two different roles. I am sitting on a yoga mat in my room, “stretching,” a mathematics file open on my laptop in front of me. My legs are yowling, but tomorrow I have to run two miles in 16 minutes and be ready for sprints at the end, no excuses, no setbacks. My head is spinning, but this calculus assignment is due at the start of the school day tomorrow and my formula for the hypervolume of an n-sphere is still off by a factor of three. I am playing two different roles, but one is so physical and the other so mental that they do not declare war in my body or my brain, and this is how I escape.
(The volume of an n-sphere is proportional to r^n where r is the radius of the n-sphere. For even values of n, pi is raised to the power of n/2. For odd values of n, pi is raised to the power of (n-1)/2…)
This is how I escape: When my body is tired my mind can still come alive, and recently it does, because I am remembering how much I love math. There is no moment more satisfying than finally seeing the pattern, the last piece finally clicking into place. My formula is not finished but it is so close, it is so close and I made it this far on my own, how can I stop now? I look at the clock. 10:30 PM. The night is young, I think, congratulate myself on a successful poeticism, back to work. Check my work, find the factor of three. (Fail to find the factor of three.) Check again. Check again. (Check again.)
(“You only get one moment in this life to be great / And you give it your all despite what it takes,” says Angel Haze, and feet are thudding in one-two-three-four rhythm and blood pounds from ear to ear and there is no stopping not now not yet…)
This is how I escape: Running requires the mental fortitude to stop thinking. It is the natural roll and flex of two ankles as they hit the ground, one whole and healthy and one sewn up but strong again. It is breath heavy in my lungs and thick from the cold air and it is the slight wheeze in my chest after—not enough to worry about, nothing worth my inhaler, just the rasp of a workout well run. (My soccer coach sends out his nine-week preseason fitness plan six weeks late. “The idea behind this program is not whether you can do these exercises,” his email reads, “But that you simply do them.” I set my jaw. There will be no “cannot.”) I will not settle for the bench this time, not this year. He wants 16 match-fit players in three weeks. I will be one of those 16 and it will not kill me. I will be stronger for it. ♦

I have been searching for warmth, safety, and stability for many years. I have been searching for a peace that would inhabit my soul and project on everything around me.
I met with the guy I told you about earlier at my aunt’s house in Lausanne, Switzerland. He came with his family so that we could finally meet in person, after seven months of a relationship that formed over the phone. I was very embarrassed and stressed out. I said hello to his family members and I shook everyone’s hand, but when I went to say hello to him, he hugged me really hard in front of everybody, even though I have not said yes to his marriage proposal. What he did was completely unacceptable in our tradition and culture, so everyone was shocked. But, in that shocking moment, something magical happened: My stress disappeared and my soul was at peace.
During that first meeting, I said yes—I agreed to marry this guy and to start a family with him. Everyone was shocked with my decision, but I was determined. My mother asked me to postpone my decision for a month or two, in order for us to get to know each other a little bit. I did not object to her request, but, deep inside me, something that I cannot explain was telling me that there was no need for more time—he was the one. Is this what they call love at first sight? My mother says that what I felt was because I need a man in my life after losing my father, but it does not matter to me. I always wanted a husband who would be a father, a friend and a partner. That has always been my dream, and I have finally found it.
After meeting him in person, I could not stop thinking about him. So, against everybody’s will, I decided to marry him. I know that I might have made the wrong decision, but I promise you, I could not control myself. Some mysterious force was pushing me to make the decision.
I left the refugee camp and joined him in his house. My mother got really angry at first, but she eventually supported me. Some people criticized me, but who are they to judge me? I have been through so much, and I need this man. He can provide me with the peace that I have long been looking for. Contrary to what I had expected, when I stepped into his house for the first time, I felt at home immediately. The house gave me safety and stability. Do I love him or do I need him?
He is a very kind man. I feel that, with him, I will finally be able to enjoy life after my long and painful journey. I have finally found love and kindness—and people keep asking me to take my time! Sure, I will not wait or hesitate. I finally feel that I own the whole world. This man has filled the place of everyone else. When I am next to him, I feel that I do not need anything from this world. I am very excited. My life with him is the beginning of academic and professional success. I trust this man, but sometimes I wonder how I came to trust him after all that I have been through.
He promised that he will always be here for me, and support me so that I can go back to school and continue my studies. I hope I made the right decision, and I hope that life will not shock me once again. Pray for me, please! ♦

The other day I was feeling very anxious so I decided to email my friend Ashley. Ashley left for a missionary trip for 18 months, a few weeks before my winter break ended. She emails me, and the rest of her loved ones, once a week, but I haven’t been writing back because I miss her so much, and wouldn’t want to put a damper on her mood with a sad email. However, on Saturday, I realized that my feelings about her absence weren’t so raw anymore. I told her how I proud I was of her, that going across the country for practically two years was one of the biggest and best decisions I think she could’ve made. 
I mostly miss our laughter. I remember the night before she left: All of our friends crowded in her dining room like old times. We snapped polaroids and recalled all her embarrassing moments. All we could do was laugh until it was time to say goodbye—it was a bittersweet moment. I don’t think I’ve laughed like that since then, and I don’t say that with sadness. That happiness is something specific to our friendship. We’ll pick up where we left off when she comes back. ♦

I’ve had someone in my life who is, for lack of a better word, an asshole. Someone who was supposed to be my friend but doesn’t act like it. They are a racist, queerphobic, ableist, and sexist individual, and I don’t know how I’ve put up with them for so long.
This is an example of the straw that broke the camel’s back—there have been layers of straw, of racism and sexism. These things were right on the surface. I thought I could educate the boy, but it’s been four years and nothing has changed. Then there’s the queerphobia, which I noticed as soon as I came out. I thought of all my friends the gay one would be the most accepting, but those things don’t go hand-in-hand. He’s called me greedy for “not choosing a sexuality” and greedy for “being too many genders.” He’s even blamed me for oppression against queer folk.
I really needed to rant. But if we’re doing morals—I like morals—here’s one: Get rid of the toxic people in your life as soon as you can. ♦

I’ve been feeling like I’m floating. I’m constantly daydreaming, maybe that’s why I always see a dark shadow on my grandmother’s staircase. But I’m not scared of the shadow anymore. It feels kind of friendly to me now. The weird, dark cloak of nothing makes me feel like I’m in the film Spirited Away. I’ve never talked to the shadow, but I feel like it understands me. The shadow doesn’t need clothes or words to be happy. It can be by itself until the end of time and it will be OK. But maybe the dark shadow feels lonely, like it needs a friend.
We all need friends. It’s relaxing to know there are people you can talk to about anything. But, sometimes, we just can’t find friends. In my case, no one ever knows what I’m talking about, and it leaves me in a frustrated state. Even though I hang out with a group of associates at lunch break, doesn’t mean I relate to them. Most of the time, I find their conversations drab. The only reason I chill with them is because people don’t pick on me when I’m in a group. If I had my own way, I would just hang out with myself. I’m my only real friend, I guess. 
So this is why I’m attached to the shadow. We have very similar souls. I hope I’m the friend the shadow seeks. We both need a friend so we should definitely meet up sometime soon. I see him every week or so—when I drink tea with my Nan. We haven’t spoken yet, but I plan on getting to know him. I have a feeling that only I can see him because I believe in things like that: a spirit world. Maybe I have a special eye for weird forces who need help from the human realm. 
Either way, he hasn’t harmed me, yet. And I would like to keep it that way. ♦

I made a mistake. What I do too often is settle for something less than even I think I deserve, and this goes all the way down to the little things. It’s been six months since I’ve been on a soccer field and, for all of the encouragement I’ve received, it shows. So at my high school’s open gym yesterday, my first remotely competitive play since August, when my ankle started twinging and I didn’t want to risk running much more, I offered to play goalkeeper. Might as well stay on the field, right? It’s a good way to practice reading the game, getting your angles right—
That was not necessarily my mistake. My mistake occurred 30 seconds into the first game, when one of the varsity senior boys slammed a shot towards the top corner of the goal to my far left. I do not remember jumping. I do not remember my hand coming up. I do remember the ball glancing off my extended fingers and tipping over the crossbar just so. I do remember hitting the ground, knee to hip to shoulder like I’ve seen so many keepers do on my television. And I do remember my teammates cheering, half in awe, half in disbelief.
That was my mistake.
Or maybe my mistake was the string of similar saves I made in the next half hour.
Or the fact that one of the best players on the pitch never put a shot past me. (There was much loud swearing on his part.)
Or when my coach sidled over to my right goalpost and said, “Do you have a secret desire to be a goalkeeper or something? Because—” and my answer was, surprisingly, not a flat out “No.”
My hatred of the goalkeeper position used to be visceral. I don’t care that I can use my hands! This is a big goal and I am very small!! It didn’t help that when I was in fifth grade my rec team’s goalkeeper broke her wrist stopping a shot from one of the big eighth graders on a rival team. Or that the longer I remained a field player, the less hand-eye coordination I kept. It’s a running joke that I’d be better off playing basketball with my feet.
But here’s the thing. I’m not small anymore. I’m five foot ten in my bare feet and I am strong. Everyone in my P.E. class look at me sideways in the weight room because the only person who regularly loads more onto their barbells than I do is our teacher (who’s also the school’s cross country coach and is probably some kind of minor god). The training I did in physical therapy has improved my balance and hand-eye coordination and reaction time. And it wouldn’t be my first time playing a brand new position to start the season. My club team made me a starting defender even after I vehemently declared myself a forward. That didn’t work out terribly. So maybe I made a mistake. But if my coach thinks it’d be best for the team, then I’m not going to argue. The team comes before the player. ♦

Sitting in the waiting room, I’m pleased with how sinister all of the Ash Wednesday ash crosses have become. Smudged and torn apart on forehead after forehead I am reminded of being a child with the ecclesiastical mark, the priest’s blackened thumb coming towards me like the angel for the firstborn. My mother and I were ember twins but of course our crosses were always crooked and easy to separate in the special way of new babies. It wouldn’t feel right if I couldn’t pull apart the tendons of my memory through details like this. 
When I roll through the darkness I do it fetally, I do it with enough bent structure to keep me attentive. A few restraints here and there on the oxygen intake and I’m golden. Midas was my favorite father. I am constantly entombed by what I least expect. My love returns to make a nutritious meal out of me-it is the worst condition no matter the landscape.
I turned and refused to be tied up and shot in the backyard when he was done with me. I said, I turned and refused to be tied up and shot in the backyard when he was done with me. Once was more than enough. Twice was a sympathy. Three times and I was on the fast track to bronze. A friend and I discuss my vengeance before bed: I question how it manifests in my daily routine and how high its levels in my blood can get. The red blood cells do not look amused. Neither do the cancer additions. 
I don’t think admitting anything through any action at this point would do me any good—I made the wrong move. I screwed up the initial and now it’s gone. My therapist gently reminds me that it’s because I’m missing a love object and I say thanks I know already can I resign now but I don’t, I say, “I know. I miss her. Help me.” ♦

Every half-term break I say to myself that I’m gonna actually leave the house more and see my friends. And then every half-term, I stay in bed and watch too much Netflix while drinking too much wine and eating copious amounts of food covered in cheese. I did this yet again, and avoided all work that had to be done until the last minute. Now I’ve got three days to type up work that I should have done at the beginning of the break. Another pattern I find myself in—always telling myself to get the work done immediately so I can chill out for the rest of the break, and then doing the work with only hours left until the deadline.
This doesn’t exactly paint a good picture of me, but then again it’s 14:55 and I’m lying in bed after eating a box of Turkish delight, so I can’t exactly vouch for my own well-being at this time. I haven’t left the house in over three days and I haven’t changed out of pajamas in that time, so I think it’s safe to say that I am in a rut.
It’s time to get out, but that might take a while. ♦

I got a job! It’s in retail, which I’ve never done before so it’s a learning experience, but I’ll catch on. Everyone’s really nice and the shop is cute. I just have to work on having and managing a real schedule, because it’s getting pretty hectic between work, school, and therapy.
I don’t think I’m going to transfer to a different school anymore because I haven’t come across another school that has a similar communications program. I really do hate it here but I don’t know what else to do, I’m stuck. Therapy is helping. I never thought having my feelings validated could be so important and life-changing. I’m still depressed, that just a part of me, but I do feel—I don’t know—higher? Just less down, like I have something to look forward to. I still struggle with getting up in the morning but when I finally get up it’s not so bad. It’s as if I’ve got a little brightness setting that’s been turned up, not all the way but just enough to see a glimpse of all the great things I have going for me right now. I still get that feeling of floating through the day sometimes, but this new feeling is like flying, not high, but just above ground, and that’s progress. ♦

Sometimes, I wonder how it feels to be born attractive. This isn’t even an act like, Look at me I’m so ugly, I love self pity, and I get that everyone is beautiful in their own way, but I still wonder how it feels. 
The only two places I choose to reside are at school and at my house. School is bearable for me now because I’ve realized that no matter how messed up the system is, I still need an education. My house is cool, I guess. It has a fridge and different rooms in it, but I constantly fantasize about the day when I’m grown up and have my own house. (Especially because I don’t want to listen to anyone because I’m a really stubborn person.) But these two places where I spend most of my time are filled with people, and the first thing I notice when I look at them is their appearance. And when I look at them, they look really good.
My sister is looking good on the daily, and the girls who will probably never talk to me at school somehow always looks flawless. It’s like they’re aliens from outer space who physically can’t have acne or low self-esteem. So when I’m surrounded with these pretty people, it’s basically natural for me to feel depressed and a bit envious. Still, I know that although there’s not much going on with my face, there is a lot going on in my head. I know it’s cheesy, but it’s true.
The saying “beauty is in the eye of the beholder,” is a comforting sequence of words, but what upsets me is feeling as though there aren’t many beholders who’d find me attractive. And I know that I shouldn’t care because I’m nearly 14 and it’s “forbidden” in my culture to think about things like this, but some adults don’t realize that at this time in a person’s life our minds go crazy. For example, the past week has been filled with me creating fantasies in which I watch ’90s sitcoms with the skate group, Illegal Civilization. Being a teenager is awkward and random, but ignoring it doesn’t make it stop. And having no outlet to tell people how you feel because it is “rude” to do so is really pointless (no offense, mum and dad).
Maybe I should spend less time looking in the mirror and more time reading or taking photos of things I like. Maybe the world makes us think we’re ugly so that we worry too much about our looks and end up not accomplishing anything with our lives. I’ve got aspirations that travel deeper than the way I look. As long as my face is clean, it’s good enough for me. ♦

A few days ago, I got word of the death of a friend. It’s funny how the friend who relayed the news put it, she told me, through Messenger, that he “was already gone.” My initial reaction was to ask, “Where to? Will he ever come back?” But of course I knew deep inside that what she meant was death.
***
I have a lot of thoughts floating around, without a way to scribble them into a notebook—for fear of reducing their intensity. What’s surprising, though, is that these scattered thoughts line up when I call them to mind. As though my neurons, or those sparkly things inside the brain that run fast, have created a bulleted list and organized my scatterbrained musings into categories and subcategories.
(At this point I stopped writing because I couldn’t focus. My next-door neighbor, who is a mom, was scream-teaching her child for about 45 minutes. I could hear snippets of what she said, “OK! YOU KNOW WHAT GIVES US LIGHT AND ENERGY RIGHT??? THE SUN! THE MOON!” I still can’t get the shrill intensity and terror of this out of my mind. I silently tell the child “I’m sorry.”)
This clearheadedness seem to bayonet its way into my brain, and I’m still reeling from the blows. It was made manifest last week when I went to karaoke with people from my high school. I was surprised that I wasn’t reserved or mean, which I usually am, as a “self-defense” tactic. It’s a fresh spirit in me, like I’ve been baptized into the religion of the universe, and adopted by gods who dwell in the stars. It’s refreshing, strange, alchemical even.
***
When the fact of my friend’s death sank in, a few of my friends retreated to chat on Messenger. Most of us felt guilty for having overlooked our friend’s condition. Of course, we reassured ourselves by saying, “We didn’t know…who knew?” Of course, we kept asking questions that could only be answered if we’d cared enough to know. Of course, we had to keep asking even though we knew that there was no other way to come up with an answer. Of course, we couldn’t get our minds off how guilt ridden and ashamed we are. Of course, we blamed ourselves. What better recourse for guilt caused by carelessness than to seek closure and answers? 
As I lay in the dark that night, I realized that seeking closure and answers for our friend’s death would free us of the pain and guilt that we were carrying. I fell asleep thinking, What a selfish and diabolic friend I am. ♦

Crying me is SO refreshing. I talk about summer, I talk about small relapse, but this is the best state by far. I am a little shaky and my face is flushed but it doesn’t fold up the way it used to and the sobs are soft. As I am wiping my glasses I feel a familiar light throbbing in the center of my head, the telltale beat of every sensitivity pulled out of its habitat and stretched to the extreme. My mom goes, “Stop playing with your hair.” My cousin says, “Stop playing with your hair.” The cow goes, “Moo (footnote: stop playing with your hair).” It still falls. If I had saved it all I could’ve made a cushion of my anxiety by now. People don’t deny physical things the way they do concepts. This is a given that we are not allowed to bring up. It amazes me how volatile givens tend to be, but the controversy of Holzer’s truisms is a testament to such a phenomenon, I think. 
I like to be scrubbed clean without all of the blood and ripped capillaries and dust from the peeling of old skin layers. I have never been able to hurt my skin or cut into it and I am grateful, but it leaves the pain in its respective lining to fester. I take it in waves. Sometimes I like it all at once. I must lend a benevolent hand when I am handling my own skin. I still have much to learn. ♦

I do not have many options: I can die by drowning, or choose an unknown land; I can stay in this swamp of blood, injustice, and humiliation or travel to a new place where I have no people, friends, memories, or history.
My mother gathered the family together and informed us of her plans to get us out of the country. She warned us that leaving is not an easy process—it involves many dangers and difficulties. We would run away from the unpredictable reality in which we live, she said, to an unknown world. Although the life we live here has become truly perplexing, it still worries me that we do not know what will happen if we leave.
Recently, my mother has been seriously preparing for our travels. She quit her job and started gathering important documents that we might need, such as school transcripts and birth certificates, which is a long and expensive process.
Although this step scares me, I have been the biggest supporter of my mother’s decision because I am an adventurous person by nature. Also, it has become very clear to me that it is impossible to continue living here. I trust my mother’s decisions. I know that she is a very wise person and that she carefully weighs matters before taking a step. I also feel good because we will all do it together: It is very important to me that we stick together. I feel that our whole country and society have collapsed and the only shelter we have now is family.
We made our decision. We are leaving. I wonder whether we can call it a decision, since our circumstances have left us no other choice—we are forced to leave our own country in order to survive. Our family of all girls and one young boy has a great urge to leave, and we don’t even have it as bad as other families who have young men who must serve in the military. But what can I say? Our fate is what it is, and will have its way with us.
My mother had a troubling experience when she was on her way home from work—a young man in military uniform stopped the bus that she was on. He was yelling and cursing, looking for a high school girl who was in the back seat. He pulled the girl’s arm and began to drag her off the bus, as she cried and screamed for help. None of the men on the bus said a word—they were scared of him because he was in military uniform. My mother couldn’t stop herself from speaking, and she asked him if he was related to the girl. He yelled at my mother and pushed her hand off of the girl, so she stared in his face and told him that he wouldn’t get to the girl unless it was over her dead body. My mother’s actions and words inspired other people to help, and together they kicked him off the bus while he was yelling and threatening my mother with imprisonment and even death. My mother accompanied the girl to school, and she learned that the girl had promised to meet with the soldier that day, but when they were on the phone the night before she got a bad feeling and felt that she couldn’t trust him, so she changed her mind. This is why he was so angry and revealed his inner monster. This is the country that we live in right now. There is no law, and no system to protect individuals.
Because of how focused I am on the idea of traveling, I got distracted and was hit by a car while crossing the street. It was not a big accident, and I had only a few bruises here and there. My mother is not happy about how distracted I was, and has asked me to be more careful. She has also been keeping me and my siblings busy with too many tasks. I think she wants to keep us occupied, but also prepare us for the journey ahead. She wants us to take responsibility and learn on our own so that we become stronger. She doesn’t want us to lose balance in this troubled world. ♦

The coming of 2016 felt like the world, the whole of humanity, was on the verge of something. I look around: The sunlight is much softer, hearts are kinder, and the atmosphere glows, making its touch less volatile.
I spent New Year’s with my family in the province. I was really anxious about it. The air was crisp and cold when I arrived, a gentle reminder of the coming onslaught of “hey ho’s,” fireworks, hugs, and warmth. The first blast of fireworks went off at exactly 11:11 PM. I smiled inwardly. I felt my heart beat fast as the countdown started. “Finally, 2015, so long, my friend! Adieu!” Farewells I’d never tire of. When the clock struck midnight, I thought of Snow White. Three minutes of fireworks left me in awe, jumping up and down, coins wiggling in my pockets, hugging and kissing grandma—some early 2016 memories. My 7-year-old cousin and I shared a bottle of apple-flavored beer, and he drank more than I did. Before sleeping, I wrote, “We will not flicker nor fade” in my journal.
I took a bus bound back to the city the next day. As we crossed the threshold of the place I once called home, I thought of all the pains I’d endured which had led me to grow. I whisper a prayer of gratitude. I knew right then that I’d keep roaming, moving, growing. And home will be a whisper away. ♦

Among other things. Boys are constantly trying to drain me of my plasma. I avoid them through hibernation. They do not understand the path to my cave of recovery—the lack of breadcrumbs hardened by age’s touch, no platelet girls to lead them, the noose of hair, the wine-stained dirt sprinkled with herbs for purification. 
And the worst of them want my spleen. I hear one of them upon approach, the dulled knife for removal cloaked in his fuzzed words, and immediately the temptation of Samael shoots down my turrets and I am trapped under the rumble.

Writing is hard. Some of my classmates act like it’s not. “I can crank out a college essay in 20 minutes,” someone brags to me in the hall. 
“I never start my papers until the night before and I still get good grades,” someone else challenges. 
By the time we’re seniors in high school, I guess that isn’t too surprising—I’ve done my fair share of both. But that’s a very specific kind of writing, one that we’re basically trained to do, day in and day out, for years. I wonder to myself: When was the last time those classmates sat down and wrote something for themselves? Not for a grade. Not for a deadline. Not for an application.
Say I asked them that question and they didn’t know, couldn’t tell me the answer, I couldn’t blame them. It’s not like we’re given much time, especially at a school like mine where math and science classes get heavy outside attention, and it sometimes feels like our English and social studies teachers are just doing whatever they possibly can to get us thinking outside that box again.
I still make an effort—every once in a while, on a weekend or over a break—to sit down and write something just for me. It doesn’t have to be good, I tell myself. I can erase it from the face of the earth when I’m done if I want. No one else will ever see it.
But I used to write so much. In third grade, my best friends and I started a tiny writing club—only four or five people—at my elementary school; we met once a week after school and spent a happy hour reading excerpts of what we had written over the past seven days aloud to each other. Together, we invented and scrapped hundreds of settings and characters, and gave each other suggestions on where to next take our plotlines. Everyone looked forward to the club every week, hooked on the serial updates, pushing each other to have the next segment of Oracle’s Gateway or Observatory 101 finished by Wednesday. (That was hardly a deadline, though. All too often one of us would come in with something entirely different and everyone’s eight-year-old minds would be wiped clean of the previous endeavor in favor of the new one.)
I still have almost all of those old journals, the first drafts of pieces that won local writing competitions and—more importantly—the undivided attention of my friends every Wednesday.
Sharing my writing used to drive me to finish things, to carry them through, to not disappoint my tiny but crucial audience each week. It wasn’t pressure—it was support. The deadline written at the top of an assignment sheet is pressure. The honest engagement in the trials and tribulations I’d put my characters through—that was support.
Maybe it’s time to stop being so private about everything I write. Call it a New Year’s resolution. ♦

I am a woman, a girl, that’s one aspect of me but it doesn’t define my entire being. To be honest, my gender is still something I’m discovering. I can be feminine and polite, or rugged and wild—my gender shouldn’t control who I am. But it does.
If I dress in comfortable clothes, I’m a slob. If I dress myself up, I’m trying too hard. If I say I like comic books, I’m a fake, If I like makeup and hair, I’m superficial. If I have sex, I’m a slut. If I don’t, I’m a prude. Double standards or what?
When I was a child, I wanted a remote control car. It was silver and I got it for being well-behaved. “It’s a boy’s toy,” the catalogue said, “It’s a boy’s toy,” said the kids on my street. But I didn’t care. I would play with it on my street with my father, and then attach notes to it and send them inside to my mother. It wasn’t a boy’s toy, it was my toy.
Then there were Barbies. At first I rejected them, like I did the colour pink, because pink is for girls, and anything forced upon me because of my gender made me weep. Eventually Barbies and dolls became my make believe, they were spies and witches, superheroes and villains. I created world after world.
Now I am a teenager reaching adulthood and my understanding of gender has become more complicated and less literal, but I don’t think I’ve changed that much since I was a child. Except now I know that regardless of whether I wear pink and put makeup on my face and wear heels, I can still kick your ass. ♦

I feel my body shaking and I cannot tell whether it is because of the cold weather, or because of the unknown that I will soon be facing.
We have already purchased our plane tickets. We will travel by land in Beirut, and from there we will take a plane to Sabiha Airport in Istanbul. I am scared and I do not know why. Is it because I’m leaving my country? Or is it because I’m moving to a new place where I do not know the language and the culture?
With all the pain and humiliation that I’ve suffered here, it is hard for me to believe that this fear stems from the idea that I will be leaving my country. What would I be nostalgic for? My destroyed life? My father who was killed? Or my home that I lost? My home country has taken everything away from me. It took away my life and my future.
Perhaps my fear stems from the fact that I will be moving to a place that I do not know. Maybe I am afraid that I will not be able to cope with my new life. But we’ve been through a lot, and along the road we’ve learned to cope with all types of challenges. 
Why am I scared? Is it because I’ve learned not to trust life or fate? Is it because, deep inside, I believe that my fate is going to follow me wherever I go, and put hardships in my way?
I must not let my fear control me. I must focus on my travels. I helped my mother with getting our documents certified from the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates. I spent an entire week running from one office to another, but I am finally done and all our papers are ready.
My visit to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates was really difficult. They do a thorough and humiliating search on people. They make you feel like you are a criminal. I got really frustrated when a man paid the officer a bribe, and simply cut to the front of a long line in which tens of people were waiting. The hardest part was that the security police violently arrested three young men, simply because their age was suitable to serve in the military. And some people keep asking why are we leaving our country? What a silly question! The answer is very clear: because we are in a country where we are not treated like human beings. When I was at the ministry, I felt that I was suffocating. I wanted to scream, but I was too scared. 
Young people make their country stronger. This is what we learned in school, but we never realized that young people are stronger only when they live in a country that provides them with what they need to survive. It is a two-way street. My country should provide me with the basic requirements of humanity in order for me to give back to my country. Young people are fed up and exhausted. This is why they are leaving. 
Yes, I am scared, but no matter how challenging the future might be, it will never be as bad as the reality I live in now.

For a while now, I’ve been pretty confident about my sexuality. I probably first acknowledged that I liked girls when I was in seventh grade. That was also the year I got a boyfriend because all of my other friends had one. I talked to him once over five months. I’ve identified as queer, or gay, or “not straight” for years, and long ago decided that boys are disgusting. I still think boys are gross, but for some strange reason I recently developed a crush on a boy! 
It’s really weird. At first, I tried so hard to reject my feelings. I was thinking a lot about biphobia and how badly bisexual girls are treated in the LGBTQ+ community. I tried to convince myself that maybe, if there’s just this one exception, one boy that I really do like, I could hold on to my label as a gay girl. The “gold star lesbian”—a lesbian who has never been with a guy and never plans to be—is a big thing in the lesbian community. Pressure and biphobia from the community made me want to have a “gold star lifestyle.” 
I’ve just started to understand that I shouldn’t have to force myself not to like someone. It’s really confusing me for me though, liking a boy, since I never ever pictured this. I’m still kinda scared to talk about it to my friends because so many biphobic habits develop in the community. I don’t really know where I am with my sexuality at this point, and part of me is upset that one boy could throw that off. 
Queer is still what I’m most comfortable with. I don’t know if I could identify as bi because I’m scared of the backlash. This timing is so weird though, with me liking a boy and then Amandla Stenberg coming out as bi—it’s comforting. It’s not suddenly making me identify as bi, but it’s really nice to see her do that. Part of me feels like, if Amandla can do it, I can too. 
More than anything, I just really want to figure this stuff out. ♦

If you told me to describe myself in five words, what would I say?
I’m creative, loving, empathetic, awkward, and loyal. The majority are good qualities, and while true, I wouldn’t necessarily put them in the foreground of my identity, these are just things you say in order to satisfy people. Like when they ask how you are and you say you’re fine even when you’re dying inside. Or interacting with people purely to be polite or as routine. So when you ask me to describe myself in five words. I’ll embellish.
I’m creative, but I’m also unmotivated. I have a library of ideas but no clue how to put them into a reality and no motivation to actually do them.
I’m loving but maybe a bit too much, I have attachment issues and maybe that’s to do with my fear of loss. So, instead of using the word loving, a word that seems to come easily to me, I’ll use the word attached instead. Something that maybe has too many negative connotations.
I’m empathetic, but to the point of pain. I have become so sensitive to other people’s problems that I dismiss my own. And when it comes to my own I break down when no one’s watching. This is something I rarely say out loud.
I’m awkward, but it’s more than that. I’m riddled with illnesses I can’t escape. The depression pulls me down as the anxiety laughs at me. So me being awkward isn’t just a quirky teenage girl from a John Green novel type thing. Its because I don’t know how else to be.
I’m loyal and true, and I believe in people but I’m also arrogant. I may think that I’m a lesser person than the people I love, but I also think that I’m better, superior, and that doesn’t make for a very good friend. ♦

Once the semester was finally over, I arrived home with a pile of unfinished computer science homework sitting in my laptop. My professor was nice enough to give me an extension before grades were due. To honor this gracious favor I spent most of the weekend typing Excel formulas and making basic PowerPoint presentations. I finished the majority of it by the weekend, which was a huge accomplishment considering it was a month’s worth of work (shame on me). Later, I rewarded myself by going to a Christmas party my friend threw. Many of the partygoers were writers and old friends. It was the most fun I’d had in four months. 
I got to hang out with my friends Lucy and Calyx, whom I haven’t seen since the summer, and even made new friends who are the sweetest! The night was filled with laughs, mass cuddling, selfies of that mass cuddling, and spontaneous bathroom haircuts. I was at ease—the polar opposite of the way I feel at my university—surrounded by people who understood me and who wanted to welcome me with open arms. It felt like stretching after a giant had twisted me into a pretzel, or something. I didn’t have to explain myself to anyone. My face ached from all the smiling I did that night.
Around 5 AM, Calyx, Lucy, Maggie, and I tried sleeping in the tiny, endearing office. We were literally piled on top of each other until I realized I was kneeling on Maggie. Although she didn’t complain, I suggested we move to the living room. Where Maggie and Lucy commandeered the pullout chair and floor while Calyx and I shared a couch. Our host had blessed us with an abundance of blankets, sheets, and David Bowie pajamas. 
It was such a amusing ridiculous night, the type of nights I’ve missed since coming to college. I love the silliness and randomness of various people doing impressions and yelling. These are nights my 12-year-old self dreamed of. In fact, earlier this month I noticed that even though my self esteem is at an all time low, I see now that my much younger self would think I’m the coolest person in the world. She’d look up to me and be proud of who I’ve become. At 19 I’m exactly who I said I would be when I was in grade school. Thoughts like these definitely help with my depression. 
I hoped that I could build on this feeling, so that my self-confidence could dig itself out of the rut it’s been in for the past year. I definitely kept my spirits up this break by hanging out with Leah, but I noticed that was the only time I was actually happy and at ease, and that bothers me. I don’t want to be someone who is only happy when they’re around other people. I used to be the type of person who was creative when they were alone, and who was happy with solitude. I loved myself so much. That’s what happiness is to me: Enjoying who you are as a person, by yourself. Maybe I’ll pick up drawing again, and the other activities I used to love doing alone. It’s going to be a difficult journey, but I’m sure I’ll find myself along the way. ♦

This is the last time I will write from inside my home country, Syria. I have been trying to clear my head, like one clears an old basement. I have mixed feelings and I do not know where or how to start.
My last day was very special. My mother gave us the morning as free time. We were able to do whatever we wanted and go any place we wanted, but she made us promise to be back by noon. I went to school and said goodbye to my friends and teachers. I also stopped by work, and said goodbye to my boss. He is a very nice man and helped me a lot during the many hard times. My sisters also spent time with their friends at a little park close to our house. When we got home, our mother was ready to get going. She took us to the al-Hamidiyya old market and to the Umayyad Mosque. We walked through the streets of the old quarter, bought some winter shoes and had falafel for lunch, one of Syria’s popular foods. When the day began, I was not sure why she wanted us to visit these places, but then I realized that she wanted these places to be the last things we experienced in Damascus—things for us to remember.
We had a great day and my mother was able to make us all happy. Her laughs were a little bit exaggerated, though, and it seemed that she was trying to cover her pain and sadness at leaving her home country. She paid close attention to my little brother. He has almost has no memories of Syria before the war, and that’s why she was trying to erase all the bloody memories he holds. But this can never happen in one day; he actually needs years to forget what he has witnessed since the beginning of the revolution.
At the end of our outing, my mother asked each one of us to buy something. We got to choose anything we wanted. I got a little necklace from which my father’s picture could hang. My middle sister got a book, and my little sister got a handmade woolen purse. My brother got the same candies that he used to get when my grandfather accompanied him to the al-Hamidiyya market. I feel that my brother has a lot inside him that he does not tell. Losing his father and his grandfather at a young age has affected him a lot. I really hope that leaving Syria will help him recover.
We were exhausted when we got back home. Everyone went straight to bed, but as usual I could not fall asleep—I was thinking of what brought us to this point and what will happen to us in the future. I held my pillow and started crying. I needed to let out all of these feelings that I had been holding inside me for a long time. 
My mother heard me crying. She held me close to her without saying a word, until I fell asleep in her arms, dreaming of a better tomorrow. ♦

My friend Leah and I planned to take a little road trip to Philadelphia last week, then realized we weren’t up for the drive. Instead, I stayed in the house for a bit and watched Crooklyn. There’s a part in the movie where the main character Troy is sent down south for the summer to spend time with her relatives. Watching Troy play jump rope and make jokes with her cousin brought me back to hot, sticky summers in North Carolina. My dad would send me and my sister down there to spend time with my mom’s side of the family when I was a kid. Of the three of us, I was the youngest, playing Knock Knock Ditch with my cousins, and rolling my eyes every time my sister and cousin Amber argued about whether Outkast was saying “roses really smell like doo doo” or “boo hoo” on “Roses” (they were both wrong). I wouldn’t say those were simpler times, but it was a time when I was able to find joy in everything. Even watching Troy’s reaction to her aunt making her get on her knees and pray before bed was like looking into a mirror of my past, reminding me of the first time my grandma told us to pray. 
Rewatching movies like Crooklyn and She’s Gotta Have It makes me think that Spike Lee, or the writers he hires to write some of his girl protagonist movies, really has a knack for portraying girls who are on their own or feel like they’re on their own. Girls who are spunky and strong but who are still allowed to be flawed and emotional. It’s not that annoying dehumanizing strong that I get all the time. 
It’s funny, later that week, I told a family member whom I’m very close to, that I was depressed. She reacted in a shitty way, with the whole “keep your head up, you can’t focus on the negative, OMG just be positive” thing. I found it frustrating because not only did it prove that was I right to be hesitant to tell my family members that I’m depressed, but I’m literally always positive for this person. Whenever they’re down, I always make them smile! So it was a total slap in the face for them not to allow me to be “negative” for those few minutes. 
My counselor says it’s important to create your own family at my age. I love my biological family but I’ve never been able to talk to them about anything without feeling ashamed or embarrassed afterwards. Spending time with my friends is the only thing that makes me happy; unlike my immediate family, they totally get my mental illness. 
My friend MK—whom I got close to this year—has been super supportive. We have the same music taste. Before I came home for break, we went to a Speedy Ortiz concert in Brooklyn where this super awesome band she kept talking about named Eskimeaux played and I immediately fell in love with them. Their song, “The Thunder Answered Back” explains my depression so well, specifically the lyrics toward the end of the song:
I screamed out how’d it get this bad?
And the thunder answered back,
If you know not what you lack,
Then you must unturn your back.
Your inside is overcast,
You are tethered to your past,
And it must feel like fucking hell,
To be a patchwork of yourself.
A bunch of scraps thrown and sewn around your bones,
And though you’re alone it’s holding you too tightly.
As much as I hope that this thin mask of sadness leaves me soon, it probably won’t: It’s been with me for 19 years. I just want to become comfortable with it. ♦

I’m dealing with really weird changes with my home life right now. They were bound to happen, but I wasn’t prepared. 
My mom has been engaged for three years, I think, and last month or so she decided to get married without telling anyone. No one knew at all: It was just her, my stepdad (barf), the guy who officiated, and a witness (I guess). 
I’ve never really liked her fiancé because he’s too much of a lot of things. Too obsessed with how the house is decorated, and too inconsiderate when it comes to me and my sister’s feelings. One time he found a spider and held it over my sister’s face knowing that we all really hate spiders. She cried for a week. You’d assume that my mom would jump in to do SOMETHING about it, but she doesn’t. She defends him all the time. Once, we told her that all his decorations in the house made us feel like it wasn’t really our home anymore, and she said that he was just trying to make the house look nice because “it’s not like we help anyway.” 
A while back, a big concern I had was that my mom had stopped prioritizing us. She was working hard and spending time with my stepdad, but falling short with me and my sister. It would be things like forgetting to pick me up, or not taking us shopping for school supplies. But now, that neglect has reached into my emotional needs and it’s probably the worst feeling ever to not feel like your mom is your mom. I want to be able to talk to her about important things like figuring out my sexuality, or getting over a relationship, or friends who are bugging me—things that moms know how to handle. But she doesn’t want to do that. She spends more and more time with my stepdad and less and less time with us. 
It’s one thing to feel ignored, but she makes me feel unwanted, too. A while ago, she and my stepdad would say, “We can’t wait until 2017,” whenever I did something slightly irritating—referring to the year I graduate and move out. I want to move out, but it’s different when your mom says she wants you to…it’s just a lot worse. 
So when she married him, it just confirmed that all this that I have to deal with is going to be long-term. And that’s really scary. ♦

We’re seeing each other in two days and I feel the way I used to about characters who could never be together because they were too much as a unit—susceptible to the lure of their predetermined fate as belonging to one another, and shaking with chilled sweat as I think about the Armageddon brought by their union, whether personal or worldwide. I even have the same tragic wait to see the big reveal…a morbid curiosity about it. Things are in motion the Hanged Man tells me, with his crossed-crossroads legs. Let them ride.
***
Growing up, I was a lucky spider child who got to watch Daddy Longlegs devour meals of bad energy coming toward us with relative ease and praise. And then: he fell. I remain. And as I do, I prepare with no armor for retaliation. (But with him as my ache.)
***
Anne Carson and other women of the order swept me up and away from the drawing and quartering I was close to enduring. I have not yet read even close to all that I can by her, but when she visited me late at night in bed, she left a seed by the beds of my feet and pointed to the mounds of dirt forming my chest. “It’s time,” she said without looking at me. I nodded and drew the blinds.
***
“What part of me interests you the most? The head or the foot? The lungs are a little grey right now, but they’re resting.” 
“I don’t know, I think your neck is a bit of a worthwhile prize.” 
“Take it, but be wary of how you untie the knots.” ♦

I am moving in an awful slow-motion sort of way to “Only Shallow,” a movie for all the L train platform to see and tear apart. The movement, or lack thereof, hurts. Suffering is as alluring as nudity; public tragedy invites similar shameful curiosity and desire evoked by the shock of a bare chest above the highway, a raised skirt on the bridge. In New York, especially among adults who have best adopted metropolitan stoicism, it tends to go unnoticed. A girl slowly walking and trying to dam her reservoir on the yellow strip is almost nothing to people who are forced to pass by the names of every identified 9/11 victim daily in a station on the way to work. My least favorite thing to do is compare tragedies. My least favorite thing to do is to define myself as a tragedy. Let’s start over. 
I am miserable as I exit the train to transfer to another, and I know that most people do not know, and I know that even if they did they would say nothing, and I know how this makes me feel. It makes me feel happy in my insignificance. It makes me think about my larger insignificance. And then the contentment drops away. 
The Saturday exhibition was pain, because it was a respite that was nothing more, nothing less. Occasionally, I leave the circle in my mind for a few hours and retrieve new information to mull over for eons. My entrance wound: Whitney ticket for 4:30 PM. Two. Exit wound: the open sore on my finger from when the pressure of the incessant writing became too much for the temporary skin. I am my own slip cover…
…and I am my own Christian saint. I have said it before and I will make myself redundant now, sans ignominy: ever since Joan of Arc entered my life during tender age I have thought of little else. My focus has not been solely on her, but on making the most of suffering, of martyrdom, of events to which there seemed to be no other side. I have never and will never consider myself a martyr; I have no interest in romanticizing or aestheticizing its cult either. But every moment of pain, especially following my mother’s death, especially recently, has come with some strain of the thought: What can I do with this? Who can I become from this? Who am I becoming from this? What would I be like without this suffering? The answer to the last is never solid and always serves to terrify. Is that by way of comfort or the inherent knowledge that I would be far different and would not be as content with myself? Perhaps these kinds of questions are better left to private consumption. ♦

I’ve been thinking a lot about girlhood, as my 19th birthday looms and that “girl you’ll be a woman soon” realization dawns. So, I’ve decided to rattle off an experience I’ve had that I hope people relate to.
A trip to the book section in Goodwill allowed me access to my first copy of The Coldest Winter Ever by Sister Souljah. My mom saw that $2 price tag, deemed it a classic, and handed it to me. She wanted me to read it and give her the play-by-play on how I felt about each chapter, each character, each description of the things Winter Santiaga was wearing. I now realize, in a sense, she was reliving her experience through me. And, like the doorknocker earrings and watching of hood classics, this was Mommy sharing a ’round-the-way-girl rite of passage.
Once I’d finished that book, I began to pass it around the other girls in my class. It provided an excellent alternative to Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson, itself a classic in its own right, and known for being on middle school reading lists across the country. Everyone knew you always picked Speak to read over the summer because, more than likely, you would read it again in class later on that year. Also: When it was time to read out loud, whoever had to read about the rape that had taken place made sure to put on their best somber voice, and aim to invoke the emotion of the class, all of us pretending it was our first time hearing of all of this. Then, as a reward for pushing through, we watched the movie starring Kristen Stewart in class, which is basically a free nap.
Angel, Grace, Jenn, and I huddle around each other on the bleachers. It’s gym, but our teacher is lazy so it’s basically a free period. Normally we walk around the track and gossip. Occasionally, we play double dutch, before booting Angel from the game because she’s double-handed. That day however, we huddle around the The Coldest Winter Ever and gasp at the state in which Winter’s father’s incarceration has left the family. I’m reading aloud this time and I keep adding little ad-libs for dramatic effect. “Oh my god, girl can you believe this?” And then I turn and look at all the girls leaning in behind me while they shake their heads in disbelief. 
In hindsight, there was something really funny and cool about a bunch of girls reading urban fiction and holding makeshift book clubs in various corners of our middle school. Pretending to go to the bathroom and hanging out in the staircases to discuss new titles, The Coldest Winter Ever being the OG of them all. I quickly outgrew the characters and cheesy sex plots found in other books. Yet, I just couldn’t buy into the common belief that these books were “low rate” or “less than.” They were imaginative, over the top, ongoing soap operas that took place in housing projects and places we walked toward as we headed home from school. 
That’s only one experience in a long list of them, but I was cracking up thinking about it recently. I figured I’d share. ♦

My bookmarks bar is a maze. It is full of “white noise for studying” and “this helped you calm down that one time” and songs that put me at rest quickly enough that sometimes I need them to be just a click away. More than that, though, it’s full of things that aren’t very calming to look at. Scholarship applications. Links to college admissions pages and financial aid websites, which I visit to reassure myself “one last time” that I’ve fulfilled their requirements.
It’s late to be worrying about this. Too late, in many cases. I’m doing what I can—I’m writing a lot and researching a lot and trying to catch up on the work that should have been done months ago. I don’t like thinking about the future and I guess I’ve been willing to put it at stake to avoid discomfort. I’m not proud of it. It’s certainly something I haven’t handled well.
If there is one bright point in this cold start to the semester, it’s the two miles that I ran just the other day. Slowly, yes. Timed carefully to include rests, yes. But it was solid, and it was painless, and for a blessed 20 minutes or so I didn’t have to think about anything else. For a fairly strenuous physical activity, it’s the only way I know how to relax anymore. I’d rather my stomach be burning with exertion than panic. ♦

My dreams of leaving Syria and starting over are finally becoming true. 
We took a cab to the bus station, and then a bus was supposed to take us to Beirut’s airport. When we left the bus station, I was suddenly seized by melancholy and one question occupied my mind: When will I come back to Syria? 
Can you believe that even before I left Syria, all I was thinking about was when to come back? I sometimes find it hard to understand what is going on deep inside me. I watched the streets, the people, and the shops from my window, and started crying silently. Is it because I do not know what’s in store for us? Although I had decided not to look back and to think only of the future, old memories of my friends, my school, my neighbors, and my whole life came back to me.
When we reached the Syria-Lebanon border, we had to wait in the cold for a whole hour until they finished searching everybody’s suitcases. The Syrian border officers were very rude, and the kids on the bus were scared of them. One officer said, “You will experience what real cold is when you leave your country.” His words stuck in my head, and I wondered if I’d ever find the warmth I’m searching for. 
We reached the Lebanese border, where we stopped for another two hours, until the border officers had checked our passports and suitcases. We reached Beirut’s airport at 3 AM, and waited there for a long time, since our flight was at 1 PM. I never imagined the borders between Arab countries as real ones, but after what I witnessed I understand how divided we are. At the airport, we were thoroughly searched, as if we carried some kind of disease or as if we were criminals. In those moments, I felt that the security I sought was still far out of my reach. 
When we boarded the airplane, my heart began pounding in my chest. I had never been on an plane before, and in my head, planes are connected to bombing and missiles. I sat in my seat and started thinking of the amusement parks I used to visit as a kid. I imagined that being on an plane was similar to being on a roller coaster, where I got to see the city from high above. The idea helped me calm down a little. Through my little window, I watched the cotton-like clouds, and I finally felt free. Yes, I finally felt the one thing that my people called out for: a demand that cost them a lot. When the plane began to descend, I saw the green lands of Turkey. What an amazing view that was!
We were very nervous when we left the airport because we do not speak Turkish. We were relieved to find a relative, whom we had not seen for five years, waiting for us. We took a bus, a ferry and then another bus to get to her house. The trip exhausted us, and all we wanted was to get some rest. Many people were waiting for us at her house, and they congratulated us on surviving the death swamp from which we had emerged. 
I fell into a deep sleep that night—I had not slept like that in five years. I opened my eyes and found my mother looking out of the window. I wanted to keep looking at her face, but her eyes showed exhaustion and sadness, so I cracked some jokes, hoping to lighten her mood. 
I am finally out of Syria. I am in a place where I can look forward to a better life and future. Will fate let me realize my dreams, or will it crush me again? It is too early to tell. ♦

My friend Paul, sort of the Dr. Phil of my high school, tells me the best way to get over someone is “fiend after somebody new.” Time and time again, this has proved itself true. I think it is time I apply this philosophy to all aspects of my life.
I feel annoying, and tired of crediting all the problems within my life to that one mistake which resulted in two months grounding. I don’t like doing this, because it’s all over now. I shouldn’t dwell in the past. Things can be good and fun now, and I want them to be. So I have to live in the moment.
While I was absent from it all, I made a big mistake. I assumed everything would be the same once I “re-emerged.” I isolated myself. I spent all my time and energy in one friendship, and the two of us grew dependent upon each other. I spent great amounts of time replaying memories from the past—the times I’d been with “him,” the adventures I’d had with my friends, the successes which had come to me. I disengaged from my desire to be social, even at school, one of the few places I got to see my friends. I spent all my time finishing movies and novels I’d started and not finished. All of these things ignored the present. I sought to fulfill what the past had promised. I sought to craft some perfect future.
The biggest step toward this, is to remove “his” name from my mind. I don’t think about him because I think he’s the cutest boy to ever live, or because I want to marry him one day, or even because I want to be with him right now. I think about him because it takes me back to times I was happy, which uncoincidentally, were the times when I was living in the moment. These memories remind me of going into situations with no preconceived notions and letting the randomness of nature take its course.
Despite my meticulous college searching, my to-do lists, my visualizations of my future, I have no idea what is to come. And I’m starting to realize, there is something comforting about that. ♦

I’m dealing with an argument I had with my friend this past weekend. It wasn’t really an argument. At first, there was tension on my end because this friend was doing a lot of things I didn’t like and she was oblivious to them. I really hate conflict with friends, which is why I let it go on for so long, and why I also wasn’t prepared to talk about it as soon as I ended up having to. 
I was coping by talking to other friends about my issues with her—it was a way of blowing off steam as quickly as it was building up. But at some point, talking about it just made me more mad. It’s weird, the more I talked about it, the more things I found that I’d suppressed that pissed me off. I guess I suppress these things because I hang out with her a lot, and I didn’t want to ruin anything. But now things are starting to feel kinda ruined and I’m really upset about that. 
When she asked me if something was wrong I told her I didn’t feel like talking about it. Then she asked me again, and again. So I tried to organize some things that I thought we could try working out. I told her, for instance, that she does this strange thing where she is listening but will then make what I’ve said all about her in some way. One time, I told her about something that bothered me and she was like, “I’m sorry, I can’t believe I was like this to you this whole time! I’m a terrible person and I’m so mad at myself! I hope you’ll still be my friend?” And I was just like, ???? 
There’s a time for everything, but she rushed me to talk things through and then was not really able to address the issues I raised. I’m mainly upset about the end result: She decided for herself that I don’t want to be her friend, which is so wrong! And she’s sad now, but she excommunicated herself. It’s so frustrating!! 
I don’t know when I’ll get over this, or if I’ll ever get over it, but maybe it’s truly not my issue to solve. I’m just upset that I may have lost a good friend. ♦

“She wears three rings, one for each husband…she is conceived of as never able to attain her heart’s most fervent desire. For this reason she always leaves a service in tears…”
***
There are many things I could use this page to say but I am not going to say them. There are many things I could use this mouth from my mother to say but my words only invite invasion or exile. I want to be left alone for a while. I want to stop having my growth pulled this way and that, my existence taken advantage of, my words taken for granted. 
I think it is a pain that I either cannot peacefully rest in a crevice with myself without people interrupting, or my issues are trampled and veiled by dust when the townsfolk rush out of the woods with their cries of, “Witch! Witch! Do not look at her! Do not listen to the siren call of sorrow!” I draw the Hermit card and for once, I breathe a sigh of relief. My tarot pushes me to recluse. It is the only thing I welcome into my blood. 
***
In certain pockets, there is no time. When I sleep, I am released into another world. It is neither good nor bad, but the time, or lack thereof, is never pressing on my mind. Today I passed out in my room, and when I woke up in myself I saw a gnarled tree that made me howl until I vibrated because I was so terrified. I thought that it was finally my closing scene. It was at the end of a suburban neighborhood arranged in rows, and every box television flashed the same images. The gray had settled like mist and everyone knew that I was only observing. They were interested in my screams. I don’t blame them. Their passerby eyes made me leave. 
When I see those I recognize from the parallel in my dreams, there is always a defining dread that lets me know that they are not the same as the ones I know. The pump and grind that I call my mind has morphed them into fellow souls on trial, and yet, I am always the spotlight defendant. My ambivalence lets me avoid accusations of chasing martyrdom. 
Am I a mediatrix of suffering? Is that what I must come to learn?

The final word: My thoughts could be better organized sometimes but the most painful thing in the world is to pour myself into a piece of writing, reveal my deepest frustrations and fears, and give it to someone and have them tell me that it doesn’t make sense. They don’t get it. What am I even saying? That is how you hurt me. I am giving you the key. Laugh at my foolishness. Marvel at it. Roll it into sweet dough and eat it with me as an offering to Erzulie Fréda, but only if you’ll be good and savor it for her. 
I am my favorite animal sacrifice. 
January 26, 2016
I woke up this morning and the very first thing my body told me to do was put on “Best Sunday Dress.” I can’t explain it. I sat, I listened, I cried. Afterwards, when the music was over, I sat some more, stunned. I couldn’t understand any part of it. I wasn’t even particularly sad. But it made sense.
I have the sensibilities of a wound walking but I’ve substituted the will, the fragility, the fearful exposure. My body fills out with each bite, my voice is linear—I wince at any fissures, but I persist. It is enough to live out weeks in a day. It is enough to see my words as fixtures. Every day I look at the hours to guide; post-Zoloft (almost a month clean!) I find peace in the solid advice of whatever force is unfurling the rope for me to hold. 
The break room is mine; I wake up and draw, with Loveless or the Melvins in the background, and I am appalled by the simple motivation, the leap from last year to this. I have finally settled into my element, writing at every turn and trading outside for familial warmth and thinking. Tapping. Observing. 
It feels good to live in my time—an understatement, but if we tried to fit every feeling into the limits of a sentence we would drive ourselves mad. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why so many writers are the way they are. I hate the cyclical nature of writing about writing but I want it to be known that it is my raft, my crowing morning cock, my well-built barn nestled in the back of Christina’s World. Eileen Myles said it best: 
In some way, I want my writing to take care of me. I want to live in my world. I want to carry my world with me like a shell. I want a home. It’s always been like a dream, in the way that everyone says, ‘Ooh, I wish I was a writer, I really have stories.’ They just imagine you sitting in some place all the time having this incredible life. We have such messy lives, writers, and it’s so unstable, but I think we do it because we want to create a reality on some level […] You just evolve a style of being a writer that makes it possible to say the things you need to say in the way you need to say them. Suddenly you’ve managed to live in your time.
A mouthful! But it was a necessary share. Now you know where I’ve settled. I digest the ashes of every new poem but the taste gets better each time. ♦

Why dream, when we know that our dreams will never come true?
Since the beginning of the conflict in Syria, this question has been haunting us young Syrians. In the beginning, I took my dreams for granted, and I did not even realize how crucial they were. I lost my ability to dream until a friend of mine made me a simple promise. This promise brought my dreams back to life—I dreamt that I could leave this stagnant and dangerous place that I used to call my home and my motherland.
My dreams took me to a new life without stress and fear. I dreamt that my family would genuinely smile again, and I dreamt that I would continue my studies and that I would have a bright future. I knew I was only dreaming, but I enjoyed these dreams. My mother says that our dreams should not be without limits, so that we are not crushed when we face reality, but I do not want to believe her. I want my dreams to be limitless. I want to create in my dreams the world that I cannot have in real life.
These days, the ability to dream is itself a dream, but I’ve realized that dreams are like any living plant. They need to be nourished and taken care of, or else they die. I abandoned my dreams for a time, and this made me depressed, but my depression worsened after I hid something from my mother for the first time in my life. I did tell her that I got a new job, but I did not tell her that it was a full-time job and that I could not show up to classes anymore. She thinks that I go to school in the morning and to my work in the afternoon, but really I spend my whole day at work. I cannot tell her, because she would not let me continue with this job, and I know how much we need the extra money. I had to lie to her. I had to help her. I could not watch her wearing herself out trying to put food on the table and not help her. But I do feel guilty about lying to my mother. 
Also, I’m troubled by my relationship with the guy I call my fiancé. Although I realize how good a person he is, I have a cold relationship with him. I sometimes feel for him, because this distance in our relationship is because of me. He has been really nice and willing to give me and our relationship a chance. I sometimes think that I should give this guy a break, especially because I do need someone to be by my side during these harsh times, but I fear that seeking out his closeness in this way would not be fair to him or to me. I think that time is my best friend here—I will get to know him during the coming weeks and months, I will get to know him better, and I will determine if we can continue together or not. 
Life is dull and only dreams give it color. I will hold on to my dreams like a drowning person holds on to a life vest. ♦

“If you could spend an entire day with anyone in the whole wide world, who would you spend it with?”
My first instinct is to say Harry Styles. I blurt it out before she even finishes the question. But suddenly—as determined by my own judgment, and the groans of my father—this choice seems vapid and irrational. While I would make the absolute most out of any time spent with him, I imagine it’d be very hard to have a normal day with Harry Styles. We’d have to lock ourselves in a hotel room or something, which, while I’d have no problem with, could prove daunting and awkward. Possibly even boring, given all I know of him are brief interviews from Seventeen, and fragmented, sporadic tweets which make sense to no one but him. Harry could be a raging psychopath for all I know, hiding behind the facade of good hair and billowing Saint Laurent men’s blouses. I am going to change my answer. Sorry, love.
At first I feel defeated when I realize how many of my possible choices are dead, but then I remember this is only a game! There is my medium grunge idol, Kurt Cobain, my ghost boyfriend, River Phoenix, my feminist role model, Anna Nicole Smith, and so many more. I could spend the day discussing the state of the world with Martin Luther King, or Alexander Hamilton, or Gandhi. I could have tea with Jane Austen. I could ask Tupac and Biggie who killed them. And so I’ll pick a deceased person. Can I even pick a deceased person?
I decide to ask.
“No, only alive people. I don’t want you hanging out with anyone dead.”
Of course she doesn’t want me hanging out with dead people. She’s my mother.
I’m stumped. No Stanley Kubrick, no Buddy Holly, no Jimi Hendrix. And why am I only thinking of celebrities? That is so rude. I should be choosing people I’ve actually met. How shallow of me to choose the rich and famous. But honestly, a day spent with any person I’ve encountered in personal experience could probably be managed within the realm of reality, so why waste my hypothetical wish on someone I know? I’m stumped again.
I’m a teenager. I’m picking a celebrity.
I need to hurry up, seeing as we are playing a question-based game at a dinner party, and there are 11 other people waiting to answer, likely with better answers than mine. I must choose someone famous, but worthwhile, and smart, who has made an impact on the greater good, and on society, as well. A name instantly comes to mind.
“Malala—no, Ezra from Vampire Weekend.”
OK, so Ezra Koenig might not be as vital to the education of young girls in countries with oppressive governments as Malala Yousafzai, but Vampire Weekend has had greater personal effect upon me. His songs have brought me joy, his tweets, laughter. And Ezra is beautiful. So handsome, and funny, and smart, and clever, and lovable, and handsome… 
The next day I’m in the car. We are driving home from brunch, reminiscing about how fun last night’s dinner party was. I think back to my answer, and try to think of more. Maybe Mick Jagger or Keith Richards. They’d be fun, and very cool. Although, I feel like anything they’d tell me (especially Keith) would only encourage me to make improper decisions under the assumption that they would not affect the length of my life span. Ezra was a good choice, a really good choice, but I’m afraid if I spent only one day with him I wouldn’t have enough time to make him fall in love with me the way I am in love with him, and then I would end up in a heartbreaking situation, reminiscent of Morello’s storyline http://orange-is-the-new-black.wikia.com/wiki/Lorna_Muccio in Orange Is the New Black.
And thus, I learn there is no adequate answer. Also, that I take mindless party games way too seriously. ♦

As I type this, the tips of my fingers are quivering. Only just a little bit, as I am exhibiting other symptoms, too. A wise man once said, “We’re enraptured in the glow of love.” Who was that man, you ask? None other than Luther Vandross himself. A night spent perusing the Museum of Modern Art’s website to see if anything good was happening there, led me to discover a screening of Beasts of No Nation. I knew the movie was on Netflix, but I had yet to see it—partly due to a busy schedule and a commitment to watching House of Cards in my underwear. 
I also noticed, in the information session, that there would be a post-screening interview with the director Cary Fukunaga. I love Cary Fukunaga, I mean yeah he’s attractive, but his work is also really good. I made my class watch Sin Nombre. I made my Mom watch True Detective, against her will. Every time I noticed my Mom’s attention divert from the screen, I’d give her the play by play. Including Matthew McConaughey’s existential crisis-related dialogue that spoke to my teenage soul. The only movie in his filmography I’ve yet to see is Jane Eyre. I plan on seeing it though, I’m coming for Cary Fukunaga but staying for Michael Fassbender. 
I made the rainy trek to the MoMA, and immediately noticed I was the youngest person in the audience. There were a lot of middle aged men and women, seemingly trapped in the cycles of adulthood, but yet to let go of their filmmaking aspirations. As they shouldn’t. I’m naïve and doe eyed, yet to be knocked about by the world, but if we don’t have our dreams and aspirations, what is left of us? After finding a seat somewhere in the middle row, in the perfect place to take in such a “visceral” film, I nestled into my seat waiting for the movie to start. 
The anticipation was overwhelming for my bladder, and I made a beeline to the bathroom. While in the stall, I heard two white women discussing the film. They kept making remarks about how sad it was, and how helpless they felt about their inability to save the children portrayed. I instantly became nervous. I had never seen the film and didn’t read reviews as I didn’t want them to cloud my judgement. So, I was preparing myself for the possibility of a white savior, and the kind of movie one that pervasively places white people front and center in narratives that have nothing to do with them. 
My least favorite cinematic example of this trope is Freedom Writers. I still can’t understand why Erin Gruwell, the teacher in the film, chose the Holocaust as a way of finding a literary experience her students could relate to. So many, yet not enough, books are written about black & and brown people from multiple perspectives. The plight of Anne Frank isn’t the be all and end all of oppression, but I digress. 
The movie was excellent. Excellent. Idris Elba gave his all, a lot of sweat, and a front and center view of his bald spot for the ART. Abraham Attah, the lead actor, carries the film throughout. However, I think credit should be given to the boy who played Agu’s sidekick, Striker. He had no lines but could effectively communicate pain via his eyes, all while maintaining a sense of childhood wonder. Especially, in the scene where they are in the field playing games amongst themselves. A smile spreads across the face of a boy who not long beforehand hacked a man to death. 
After the screening, the curator ran through a few basic questions with Fukunaga. His answers were precise, blunt, and honest. Which made the chemistry with the interviewer weird. I felt the curator wanted to talk with Fukunaga as if they were old friends, but he was having none of that. “I take it this was a film of firsts, and you’d never shot in Africa before.” He was wrong. Fukunaga has been there, done that, and has the footage to back it up. Not only had he shot in Africa previously, he’d shot three films there. We were thanked for coming out and staying considering it not only rainy, but the movie was on Netflix. 
Toward the end, people dispersed, as it was pretty late. I wanted to ask him how he got a movie without a white savior financed. With some convincing from my homegirl, we waited around. The guys in front of me got him to sign some obscure DVD of a show he was featured on years ago. I wasn’t sure if I could follow up such extreme but appreciated fandom. I went for it. I asked him the big question. He answered it, completely, while attentively looking into my eyes and then agreed to take a photo with me. 
That man sucked my soul away. I joke, but in the process, he also reminded my why I had been dying to make films in the first place. To tell the stories of the “untouchables,” people who don’t matter unless we are the center of their universes. To tell that story, not from a distance that fits within the confines of our western influenced viewpoints, but close up. In the words of my father, “You got to tell it how it is!” There’s one scene where we see a group of white photojournalists in a van, taking pictures of the soldiers. The woman taking the photographs doesn’t know the children. The car drives away and in her hand she holds the stories of people she’s never even formally interacted with. We later learn that the media attention, skewed I’m sure, has actually left the soldiers worse off. 
There in that scene, Fukunaga encapsulates why telling a story with an outsider approach can backfire cruelly. I know my perspective, my feelings, and my background are hardly ever touched on screen. I have to dig deep to find anything I can relate to in most media. Even the themes I find relatable tend to be universal. As in, woe is me I don’t know what I want from my life! Then, the film or show takes a turn and the protagonist uses social status or old family money to advance once they find their purpose. And I roll my eyes, mumble under my breath that I need to work on my screenplay. 
I want to talk about my Nana’s journey from her small southern town smoldering in the ashes of the Civil War and Jim Crow to bustling NYC at 17 years old. My great grandfather finding himself and working odd jobs to buy zoot suits in ’20s Harlem. I’ve seen the pictures of family members sitting in a club, Cab Calloway nestled between them. I often imagine those images in my head, the dialogue they must’ve had, and the fear they must’ve felt. 
I often end these diary entries with a declaration of some sorts, so I’ll end on this note. I am inching toward my purpose, day by day. However, more and more the need to tell stories seems to creep up inside me. I haven’t picked the medium I want to use to communicate these ideas. Maybe, I don’t need to. I can be a bit of everything. Actually, I don’t need to. If the interest is there, I will do it. I am going to make films. Eventually. ♦

No matter how much we lie or how hard we try to hide something, we will get caught sooner or later.
As I mentioned to you, I hid from my mother the fact that I wasn’t attending school. Unfortunately, when we ran into a friend of mine from school who asked why I was not showing up to classes, my mother discovered the truth. I did not want to lie to her, but she believes that education should be at the very top of our priorities—so I knew that she would not let me take another job and ignore my studies.
You cannot imagine what happened. She lost her temper, and after yelling at me, she said that she would not talk to me until I went back to school. It was the first time that I have ever seen my mother that angry. I immediately agreed to quit my new job and to return to school. I understand that my decision could have led to very bad results, but all I wanted was to help my mother.
Although I understand why she was angry, I am not happy about her reaction. She got very upset because of a very small lie on my end, and even though she sees that everything around us is built on lies: Our neighbor lies and steals the water from our tank, the landlord lies so that he can raise the rent, the seller lies in order to profit, girls lie to guys so they can get an invitation to a restaurant, and they lie to their professors in order to get better grades. Guys also lie to girls for their own bad reasons. Police officers lie in order to get some extra money.
At least I lied in order to do something good. I actually feel proud of what I did. The idea that I lied to help my mother provides me with some positive energy, because at least I lied to help and did not cause harm to others, like everyone around us does. I admit that I sometimes feel angry with the world around me, but I haven’t lost my humanity.
Even my mother herself lies. She lies when she hides her fear and sadness from us. She lies when she sugarcoats the bitter reality we live in, and keeps saying, “Tomorrow will be better.” Isn’t that lying?
Although I’ve lost my new job, which means living on the small allowance that my mother gives me, I am very happy to be back at school. The allowance I get barely covers my basic transportation. Talking about transportation always makes me think of the times when the officer at the checkpoint ordered me to leave the bus because my ID card was issued in what is now an area controlled by the opposition. They are afraid of the name of a city! Can you believe it?! I really wish we could switch places, and that those officers could go live in that area. Then they might realize how exhausted the city is. Day by day I realize that I cannot hate this city, just as I can never hate my country, Syria. Despite all the pain that my country has given me, I still love it.
I’m sorry, but when I talk about my city I lose control—back to my point and back to our reality that is filled with lies. I wonder where we are going and what will happen to us. Are we turning into jungle animals with no law? No, because animals do not lie. Are we turning into stones? No, it’s even worse, because the hearts of people have become harder than stone. I do not know what lies in store for my country, because we have lost all values and principles. Meanwhile my mother is angry with me for my little lie. ♦

I am set to go back to school at the opening of the school year, which will be June next year. I won’t be going back to my old Catholic university, nor will I be going to the fine arts college I wrote about some time ago. I’ve always wanted to study in another place, another city. Not that the general quality of education in my city is inferior, it’s just that I don’t think the universities in this city can provide the prime education that I want and need in the humanities. The setback, though, is that no one in my family embraces the idea of my having to move away to get a college education. Seeing as my options are limited, I decided that I will just go to a Jesuit university—yet another Catholic school. This frustrates me deeply because, MAN, I’ve had enough of Catholic schools, and the knowledge that I can’t technically do anything about it frustrates me even more.
The entire range of human emotion is running down my spine as I ruminate on entering academia again. It’s so terrifying, and it feels as though I have time-travelled or something—to see it all for the second time around. I can’t wait, though, to gaze at a whole new world of books, routines, and uniforms. Will it feel eerie? Will I feel the way a spirit travelling back to the corporeal world would?
The world can be too vexing and exhausting: Here I am, without a cent to my name, with big dreams and big, big plans. Here I am, raw with wild ideas, without anyone at the end of the tunnel beaming a light for my path. Will I ever find a way to make this all work?
God, I just wanna be unencumbered. ♦

My parents watch me like hawks, like I’m on the tail end of my infancy instead of my teenage years. Mom looks like she wants to applaud when I limp, barefoot and ungainly and free, out of my room and across the house. She doesn’t, thankfully. It doesn’t feel like that much of a victory. It’s just a step. I used to be capable of thousands on end.
What feels better is when I lace my right foot into a high top for the first time in months and yell that I’m leaving and go to meet my friends at the library, my steps already more fluid than they were that first day. What feels better is when I’m home alone and I keep those high tops on so I can dance in my room again, my ankle twisting with my body and bearing my weight without pain. What feels better is walking up stairs, and down stairs, and across the dangerously uneven front lawn, and being able to flex my ankle further and further every day, and watching my long-neglected calf muscle begin to bulge beneath my skin again.
It’s felt like a long journey and it’s strange to think that it’s only been a few months. But already the only memory of the surgery is the two stiff pink lines that draw a V on the side of my ankle and a lingering caution to my steps as my ankle rolls inside my shoe. It’s taken up so much of my life for the past several weeks that now, on the brink of full recovery, I hardly know what to do with myself. You mean I can walk? Anywhere? I can go back to P.E., and shower standing up, and cuff my jeans the way I like them because one leg won’t be stuffed inside a boot? It’s practically a foreign concept.
Last winter, I promised my physical therapist that I’d stay away for as long as I could—guess I didn’t make it as far as I thought. But the roads will be icy soon, and I’ll want to walk them confidently. My goal all along has been “running again by the new year,” and it looks like I just might make it. I can see the light. I’m almost there. I’m almost done. ♦

I have let school defeat me. Junior year is really fucking hard. So much work, so much pressure. The expectations are high. I don’t want to disappoint people, but I do. Worse yet, I continue to disappoint myself. My grades are slipping, slowly but surely. Aside from my academic work, I volunteer my time to extracurriculars too liberally, many of which are of no great interest to me. When I do have time, I don’t use it well. I neglect to do anything about my procrastination—I can deal with that later.
School is stress, and stress needs an outlet. For me, this entails spending time with my friends. But considering my current state of grounding until my parents’s further notice, I can’t do that. At first it was upsetting, but now, I’ve forgotten what going out and spending time with friends is like. I feel completely disconnected from everyone, but not in a sad or longing way, in a very factual way. I think that makes me feel even worse.
I’ve been eating out of boredom, which has led to weight gain, albeit small, it makes me feel gluttonous and impulsive. I know it shouldn’t make me feel this way, that I should accept my body in all its changing forms, for it serves me well, but knowing that only adds to my confusion and angst.
Thoughts of college motivate me, but this weekend being on a college campus proved discouraging. I went to a Model Congress conference at Yale and was astounded by the social disconnect I witnessed. Prep school students offered overwhelming support for the existence of “reverse racism” and the exclusion of refugees. The leering glances towards a Sikh guy every time the TSA or 9/11 was mentioned in debate showed me why students of color feel so uncomfortable on college campuses. I understand why New Haven is a divided city, one side overflowing with gothic-style residence colleges, expensive cafes, and Ralph Lauren; the other, plagued by poverty and homelessness. As mirrored in mock government, the people with the power to change things often don’t, because they have no personal motivation to do so. No matter how brilliant, some people will never understand their privilege.
I came back from the fake decisions of Model Congress to news of the real decisions of the Senate voting to defund Planned Parenthood and to dismantle certain elements of Obamacare. In the wake of further shootings, the NRA and GOP urged better open carry laws, and thwarted bills which would regulate the process of gun licensing. I wanted to look at the positive side of my going away—an overnight excursion with friends from school, great pizza, acquired knowledge—but I returned home to the most work I’ve had all year. Plus, I was one of the few students from my school to not have received an award. It felt I’d wasted my efforts, the time I could’ve spent getting a leg up on my workload, and my parents’ money.
Money. Why do I care about money? I shouldn’t yet. But it seems with every test registration, school trip, insurance premium, college tour, I cost my parents more and more. I don’t want to be a financial burden on them. I’m not a safe investment.
I have no faith in myself, nor in anyone else, and maybe not even in the world. I want things to get better, but I don’t have the energy to make them so. I hope these feelings end soon. ♦

After Sam falls asleep, I say to him, “Message for when you wake up: Help people keep finding me no matter how much I try to obscure myself. I have no space, I constantly feel trapped, and I literally can’t breathe I’m so anxious.” When he reads it, it will probably be early morning and I will have forgotten the urgency in my fingers tapping out to him my crowded plea. I say, “I wish I didn’t understand sometimes.” He is admittedly the one person who truly gets me and would be able to comprehend anything I told him, but our main difference is that I am fated to solitude and he is not. I do not know what, or who, willed it, but my plane seems immune to running perpendicular to everyone else’s. 
He called me earlier, when I was in the kitchen with my cousin Ingrid. “Hi, cousin,” he said when I told him that she was sitting on the stool beside me, “She sounds like she cares.” She thinks the same about him.
My cousin’s house radiates the same central Brooklyn Caribbean/South American warmth of my late mother’s apartment. I live there with her and her 21-year-old daughter, who I am equally close to. My great aunt is there most of the time, and my grandmother lives a few miles away. Their dog Rambo receives the majority of my love on a daily basis. I understand the joy of holding your own baby in your arms because of him. 
Sometimes I wonder how hard it would be for the childhood version of me to recognize myself. I think about whether or not they would be pleased. Maybe I am putting too much faith in a mind fresh out of the womb. I owe myself more than to trust the judgment of an elementary schooler on my identity. Even just a year ago, I thought that I was the kind of person who barely experienced recognizable change in their life; now I recognize the voluntary ignorance at play. 
I tell myself to have a happy Chanukkah because I have no one to light the prolific windowsill menorah with. The compromise was worth it; I would rather practice my faith alone as an exercise in independence than reside with a false mother and accept her gaslighting in exchange for slight religious guidance.
My oil has run for far longer than most expected. Now is not the time to let it spill. ♦

The situation in Damascus has deteriorated recently, and the capital has been targeted by many bombs. The government launched a new campaign to draft people for military service, and now young men are too scared to leave their homes. They worry that they might be arrested at a checkpoint and forcefully enrolled in the “death military,” as they call it. The security service has also been raiding people’s homes, looking for anti-government activists or for young men to draft. And of course, my mother’s practice of helping people by sheltering them in our home has landed us in trouble, especially since she recently welcomed a man who is on the security forces’ wanted list because of his opposition to the government. Fortunately, the man was not at our place when they raided it, looking for him. I sometimes do not understand how she follows her emotions and lets go of her wisdom, how she forgets that her principles might endanger us. In any case, the recent situation has finally convinced my mother that we should flee the country.
This decision comes with significant expense, and my mother was forced to sell the necklace that my father gave her for their wedding, and she cried because she felt that she was selling a piece of her history. As for me, I do not care for old memories anymore. Life has been so hard that my memories have faded. What matters is that selling this necklace will hopefully save our lives. Although I know that she made the right decision, I cannot stop myself from being scared, because it means a new start in an unknown world. Perhaps the war has taken my courage from me and replaced it with fear and caution. 
I am happy about my mother’s decision, but I am scared, too. What if fate is toying with us again? Well, at least I will be with my family and I know that we will be able to work together and overcome the challenges ahead. The difficulty in my life over the past few years has empowered me, and I believe that I can now face life on my own, but I would never leave my family behind. I feel that I should use whatever strength I have to support and help my mother. Regardless of all my personal dreams, there is something that strongly connects me to my family. Perhaps it is my unconscious knowledge that we need to stick together in order to survive these times. 
Despite my fears, this decision has allowed me to dream again. I tell myself, to try and fail is better than not trying at all. I remember how scared I was when I first left my little city and moved to the capital. But this time the journey is different. This time I will be leaving my home country, and the hurtful part is that my own home country has been very harsh to me and has pushed me to leave. War is a terrifying monster that devours its own children and throws them into exile and diaspora. Our situation reminds me of a story I once read about the civil war in Algeria. I never imagined that I would relate to that story one day. Now I can add many chapters to it. ♦

“Where have you been?! I never see you anymore.” That’s what my friends ask whenever I run into them. I lie and say I’ve been studying, but I basically haven’t left my room in two months. I spend most of the day in bed and rarely arrive to class on time. 
I thought I could get over it. I was too ashamed to take that walk up to the campus counselor. Talking to someone helped in high school, but I’m an adult now and thought I had to deal with these things on my own, which is funny because that isn’t the very “adult” thing to do. 
I’m embarrassed about my depression. I barely look people in the eye, nevermind facing my schoolwork. Admitting that I have depression means disappointing the people I care about the most. Having depression means that I have to let myself combust, let all the shattered parts of me to finally fall away from the cheap, outworn tape that holds me together. That’s terrifying because it hinders my ability to keep it together for the ones that I love—even as I type this I feel as though I’m letting them down. 
I don’t wanna be depressed, I don’t wanna be a burden to anybody. People depend on me to be quiet about my sadness so that they can handle what’s going on in their own lives: They don’t need to have me on their minds. If I tell them, they’ll have to be concerned about me, and they’ll actually see me for who I am, a disappointment. I don’t want to make things worse by having to deal with their reactions—maybe I won’t tell them.
Mumbling about how worthless I feel to the counselor is similar to vomiting. She tells me my feelings are valid and that I’m “a trooper” for going through what I’ve been through, but I don’t see it that way. I still feel as though I’m being difficult and need to get over it. Feeling that way is wrong, deep down I know it, but I’ve been conditioned to believe I should put others’ well-being before my own. 
I’m tired. Sometimes it feels like I’m floating, as if I’m barely there. I didn’t think it would get this bad—I’ve always dealt with depression but I still had the motivation to get up in the morning. Maybe it’s heightened by college. Back home I can go out with my friends to lift my spirits and ignore the way I feel, here on campus, I don’t have that outlet. I’m all alone. ♦

We’re going away on the 18th. I check out enough books from school to tide me over in case I finish Helter Skelter on the road—Tragic Ways of Killing a Woman and The Velvet Underground top the pile. The anticipation bites my ankles. I giggle and welcome its corrosion. Spring settles into December outside as fog outlines the bare figures of littleleaf lindens. 
This boy….this boy has liked me since ninth grade and I had no idea. I used to like him until I got involved with my first girlfriend. I wrote a diary entry at 14 about him briefly holding my hand, and it makes me think wow. We go to incredible lengths to appease our desires for others, even when it seems unrequited and simply not meant to happen. I feel foolish. Not only am I laughing and dancing at the edge of the cliff without realizing that the rock beneath me crumbles with every step, even after I fall I am lost in my blissful ignorance. 
But romantic feelings complicate things! You see yourself differently. You question certain things: How can I hate men so intensely and still find myself embracing soft spots in my armor? I covered the cracks and now I am widening them. You see others differently. You think, How can you like me so much? How can you feel so irrevocably for someone for so long? How can I be so oblivious? 
For once, I am very in love with being single. I can’t be myself for two people right now. Everything must settle. ♦

I’m 17 years old and I’m bisexual/pansexual, I came out just over six months ago, slowly and casually. I’d discussed my confusion and realizations about my sexual orientation with my friends, so when I came out to them I got reactions along the lines of “congratulations” and “I KNEW IT!” although a couple of friends asked if my new found sexuality was because of Ruby Rose, and whether I was sure, which made me angry and feel slightly betrayed that people I consider friends could think me so frivolous. My parents were lovely, telling me it would probably be better if I brought a girl home but at least I had the option. My dad focused on the fact that he could now talk to his daughter about hot women, something which is surprisingly less awkward than I’d previously thought.
There’s bullying and ignorance towards the LGBTQ community, but I do think the younger you are the harder it is, maybe because that’s when you’re trying to figure yourself out. I know many people who have been afraid to come out to either their family or their peers, the majority of them were met with love and acceptance when they did, but some were abandoned by family and rejected by friends. However, they managed to find a new community within the queer one, making friends for life, meeting people who understood them and related in some way or the other.
While there is conscious phobia toward the LGBTQ community, there are also people who are just ignorant, people who are not educated in the matter. They may rely on stereotypes when interacting, and while that is annoying and I get frustrated at the prejudice of others toward the LGBTQ people, for me the best approach is to politely explain their ignorance and hope they will learn from their mistake.
Something I’ve noticed more recently, as I have been invited to more and more LGBTQ events, is that the majority don’t cater for under 18s. I find this unfair as it’s at the younger age that we need community the most. The lack of accommodation is a massive issue for young queers, and it’s just plain wrong that so many events seem to center around drinking.
I’ve spoken to a few of my queer friends and acquaintances recently about their experiences, and mostly they’ve said that the most important thing is to stay true to yourself, that things will get better. As much as that seems like a cliché and I feel like I should hate it, I do believe that things get better in the majority of situations. While it’s hard being queer in general, it’s obvious to see that being a pre-18 queer is even harder. So, from me and the many of young queers I know, it gets better, you can do it, and many other clichés we know and love. ♦

My friend Kim and I are hanging out at Starbucks, talking about various things but always coming back to the essential: The dreams we hold, what we look forward to, and what we could do with all the time that’s left for us, with all the air that’s left for us to breathe. We are, at present, ecstatic knowing that there is a physical space—and perhaps even a world where our metaphors exist on a physical plane—reserved for us in the future. 
Kim laments not being able to do what she really wants to do, wasting her time on trivial matters. “I just need more time to do what I want,” she says. I nod and think, Everyone always wants more, that’s what stifles us. For all we know, time is an illusion, or an allusion to something far greater than everything we consider valuable, important, true, or great, combined. I do not say this aloud. Time as an illusion, and the disillusionment that idea brings, is but an abstract idea, much like the idea of freedom.
People hurt so much from this “lack of” and “excess of.” We want, yearn, desire, we also reject, shun, fear. Where do we draw the line? Did we happen to forget, by some unknown incident in the cognitive process, that we were rooted in love, gentleness, goodness, compassion─whatever you’d like to call it? Are we falling out of grace, or suffering due to our lack thereof? 
I do not know the answers to these questions. I’m pulsing with the knowledge that there’s so much to seek, find, and see: I dare not fail. ♦

Friday was a close call. 
Tuesday, I really kicked my school skills into high gear. I didn’t work out that entire week. Homework and work that I had pretended didn’t exist for the semester gorged themselves on my time from after school until 11 PM or later each night. It was mostly work for AP Art History and HL English. The lack of self-care, paired with the six-hours-of-sleep nights, actually made me sick. The sickness was pretty tame during the day, but flared when my stress did—at night. 
I went to the library twice to maybe learn something about pre-calculus. My friend V, an A+ in friendship and in the gradebooks, practically taught me the whole semester of pre(ty stupid)-calc in 40 minutes. The next day, however, I took my math final. I passed by one percent. Mr. S didn’t even give me points for the drawing I innocently placed under one of the free answers. *Sigh* 
We prepped the next night in the library for my math retake the following day (which was also the last day of school, whoops). V rented a study room, complete with a white board and an dry-erase marker! I drew John Cena on the board and they snapchatted it. Feels good to be appreciated. 
Pretty sure that everything I needed to know for the rational functions retake was on my sheet, I provided more Snapchat material and finished one art card for Art History. I saw my long-and-somewhat-lost friend D, and we sat down for an hour, talking about John Waters and making fun of our schools in the kids’ section. 
Friday: Me whining around the art room because I had to go do my retake. This is what I do to myself, wake up one morning (lol THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL lol) and decide that I’m going to try to be an A++ student. My brain feels like a sticker that just won’t stick to things like math. You can certainly press it down as hard as you want, but it’s just going to peel off eventually. With this encouraging metaphor in mind, I went off to take my test. Again.
When I finished my test, I turned around and couldn’t find Mr. S. We’d been the only two people in the room (yikes). As I was starting to blame the hour and 10 minutes of math for my newly-lacking vision: “How’s it going?”
A single, shrill noise came out of me. 
He was lying on the floor. OK.
“Just put the test on my desk.”
“GbyeMrSHaveagoodbreakthanksforlettingmeretakebyeeeee”
At P.F. Chang’s later that day, V and E compared As, while I concentrated on my spicy tuna rolls. Deciding to join their party, I checked my grades. 
“Guys, I got an A in HL English!”
High fives all around. My first weighted A is locked in. ♦

Reasons I am irritated:
1. My parents grounded me for two and half months, effectively ruining the last birthday of my legal childhood and the entire month of November. I am now realizing this ruination extends to winter break and New Year’s Eve. 
1a. Despite being grounded for nearly two months, I’m rocking a low D and solid C.
1b. Despite rocking a low D and solid C, I continue to obsess over going to a selective institution of higher learning, and through the experience of my elders, the senior class, I am discovering that finding a school which fulfills all of your desires is almost entirely impossible, as is getting in to that school, in the event you find it. 
2. I spend way too much time thinking about a boy who doesn’t think about me.
The only way I can fathom solving this problem is by finding a new boy to think about. 
3. My computer’s USB port no longer works, meaning there is no way to solve the issue of the expended storage of my phone or computer. Eventually, I will completely run out of space on these devices, be forced to acquire news ones, and will lose years of cyber-memories in the process.
4. I want to make an outline of my life so that I can live it more easily but that’s impossible and also flawed in nature.
5. Sleep has become a rare commodity which is sad to admit to myself.
6a. I have to spend hours of my life in courses that hold no importance to me, which I know have no relevance to the set of skills I will need in my career. 
a. Safari keeps shutting itself down, probably because I’m running out of space on my computer but maybe also because it knows I’m not actually going to finish the research paper I have due. 
7. While watching Star Wars, a woman next to me vehemently texted her daughter. She used two fingers and a lot of emojis to type. Her obnoxious brightness level was likely a result of her ignorance to the fact she could lower it. She remained this way for nearly 20 minutes. It was disgraceful. 
7a. I didn’t say anything to her because adults are scary. ♦

On Saturday, I had a Halloween party and it was pretty wonderful. All the people I love the most came and made an effort with fabulous costumes. My original besties, Sophie and Rebecca came as Harley Quinn and a slytherin student respectively—Rebecca made hers and her boyfriends costumes. My new besties Kiah and Rachel came as a vampire and a dead Cleopatra. We also had a Minnie and Mickey Mouse, the joker, and a werewolf, among other things.
The Friday before, my mum and I went shopping for nachos, sweets, and a lot of alcohol, stocking up the house. On Saturday morning, my parents and I build a gazebo in our back garden and my mum and I decorated the house with shop-bought decorations and our own creative genius. I started getting ready around 5 PM, and friends who were sleeping over arrived early to get ready with me. Guests trickled in between 7 and 8 PM and soon the party was on a roll.
People drank, talked, and danced. I made some nachos and sometime later my mum brought in many buckets of KFC and chips. For me, the best part of the evening was karaoke: I went for my favourite number: “I’ve Got a Crush on You” which I sang vaguely in the direction of the person on whom I have a crush. We went through a collection of classics and new pop and everyone ended up burned out and tired. By this point, it was well into the night and people began to leave slowly. Parents arrived in cars, cabs were called, and the drunk teenage mass disappeared, leaving only me and four of my wonderful friends. Soon we were four, and then three.
In my room, we made up some floor beds and attempted sleep. But what happens at sleepovers? You talk into the early hours about the most trivial and the realest things. I proceeded to drunk tweet my feelings. Not so bad, at least it wasn’t Facebook. ♦

Countless events of police brutality and social uprising have been throwing my anxiety through roof. The current political and racial climate in this country is exposing the true faces of my so-called friends. I’ll be grateful for it in the long run, but it’s still disheartening to learn that the people who I thought cared about me think they can dictate how I and others react to oppression. 
Back in August, two girls from the Seattle chapter of Black Lives Matter disturbed a Bernie Sanders rally to demand that he be more explicit about his plans for addressing the civil rights of black people in the U.S.. While one girl broke out in tears yelling, “My life matters,” she was met with people shouting, “Fuck you’” and “How dare you call me a racist?” from the mostly white, supposedly liberal crowd. 
I stand with those young ladies, regardless how they handled themselves, and I made a Facebook status about it for everyone to see. One of these friends commented on the status saying she disagreed. She even had the nerve to reference my “The Right to Be a Black Girl” essay as an example of how black people should express anger: “She’s angry, and rightfully so, but I don’t think she’s channeling it correctly. She just sounds angry, not necessarily smart about what she’s doing. Like, you’re angry, but that article you wrote about misogynoir was educated and eloquent. I’m not getting that from her.” 
First off, the fact that she even referenced my essay—that totally rejects policing the way black girls express themselves, especially when it comes to anger or sadness—tells me that the point of the piece totally missed her. Saying Black people need to be “eloquent” and “educated” when fighting for our rights is racist and, frankly, stupid. 
I told her she had no right to tell black people how to “channel” their anger when they’re grieving the deaths and brutalization of their people. Just because I sounded “eloquent” in my essay doesn’t mean I always sound that way, particularly when I’m talking about state-sanctioned violence. 
She also said the protesters were tarnishing the the public’s perspective of the Black Lives Matter movement, as if liberation movements don’t have different sectors. Just as the civil rights movement included more militant groups like the Black Panthers and the non-violent teachings of Martin Luther King, there are going to be different groups using different strategies to achieve the same goal: freedom. 
Her ideas suggest there is an “appropriate” way to demand human rights, that there is a “proper” way to ask someone to stop killing you. 
I don’t have to sound educated when I’m distraught about tragedy, and neither did those girls. All I got from those comments is, if I ever ever became unapologetically irate about the denial of humanity to black people, she wouldn’t stand with me, simply because it doesn’t fit her idea of how people should fight for their lives. That was heartbreaking. 
I’ve been avoiding her ever since. ♦

The first time I went to Los Angeles and actually walked around was at the start of this year, for the Rookie Yearbook Three dance party. It was great knowing that I could wear a dress with tights in sandals and have it be seen as a fashion statement rather than a DUI (dressing under the influence), as most fashions beyond Hollister and Forever 21 are deemed in my corner of suburbia. Despite feeling very liberated in that way, I was more arms-crossed-and-head-down than ever. I had this premonition with every step I took down Sunset Boulevard that someone was going to jump out from the gutter and try to take me and/or my Band of Horses LP (Amoeba!) with them. L.A. also triggered my extreme sense of ambition: How to make it in L.A? When people look down on you from high buildings as if you’re an ant, how can a person become queen of the colony? I felt terribly defeated, and kept expecting someone to step on my tiny, ant self with their heel at any minute.
At the event, I surrendered to the influence of the Rookie fandom. Not that I wasn’t truly one of the biggest SuperRooks out there, but becoming another atom in the Rook molecule definitely helped me to become more comfortable in this endless sidewalk called Los Angeles. 
This past weekend, I walked through L.A. hardly having to remind myself to breathe. I was there for the Rookie Yearbook Four party. Instead of feeling like an indent on the cement, I was a prominent bump on the face of Los Angeles, one that would need lots of concealer to cover. 
However good it felt to not want to evaporate this time around, everything was also demystified. L.A. no longer felt like stumbling upon a great series, 15 seasons of which are all on Netflix. The evening was a short film: a concentration of good thoughts and great characters that ended quickly, barely leaving a sweet taste in your mouth. The climax was quickly conquered, and I go back in time and replay it, trying to feel one melancholy way or another.
I said goodbye, this time, with a quick wave and a smile rather than a curtsey and a longing gaze lasting until the end of the 101. ♦

As all of us piled into a newfound friend’s dorm room, I began to understand the value in making the best of an unwanted situation. Everyone in that room went in circles to introduce themselves, their majors, and their disdain for the state school we’d all landed at. The most refreshing part of the conversation was hearing about other people’s failed attempts to enter the golden gates of Ivy League institutions, about weighing options based on financial aid packages, and having to defer acceptances at dream schools because of money.
It was a weird conversation to veer into after a night of dancing. I had just left a Halloween party and my search for an after-party landed me meeting new people. I was happy to, as I need new friends to help the time go by before I transfer away. The last few weeks have consisted of me consoling old friends about their mental health and an inability to stay on campus. The campus was designed by an architect who previously built women’s prisons; it has a certain Bedford Hills vibe about it. All the brown, drab, brick buildings are connected underground and the hallways feel seedy (like a ’70s exploitation movie about women in prison—you know the ones).
I have to give the school credit for effort. They invest a lot in creating an environment fertile for creativity. As a fan of music, I have access to so many new sounds, since the school pays bands to perform here. They got extra cool points with me for having Zadie Smith swing by. But, in the grand scheme of things, NYU’s artist in residence is Pharrell Williams, so I’m no longer impressed. My school has all kinds of progressive programs and seminars on consent and seems to root its curricula in social justice. Although this often translates as Tumblresque feminism—and by that I mean, not intersectional at all—the effort doesn’t go unnoticed.
But, in class, much like on the internet, people hop on the bandwagon of thought, and in an attempt to satisfy everyone, nothing goes challenged. New ideas aren’t presented if they challenge a dominant narrative already deemed radical and “inclusive” to everyone (they aren’t). As a result, things become stagnant and there is a repetitiveness to our topics of discussion.
I signed up for a liberal arts education, but what even is the value of that in 2015? I could change my area of study, but the STEM programs here aren’t great. Soon, I’ll meet with my advisor to enroll in classes for next semester and there is still the possibility that I won’t be able to take classes pertaining to the things I like. I could give a fuck about seniors getting first choice in class enrollment when I’m paying my money like everyone else. College was supposed to be different from high school—a place of refuge. And it is very different while also maintaining enough sameness for me to oppose it.
And don’t even get me started on my College Writing professor. His self-absorbed bullshit is borderline unbearable. Not to mention that he actively seeks to undermine my accomplishments or over-explain things to me as if I can’t grasp them. I constantly have to prove myself and it’s literally the most frustrating thing ever. If I were to go off about it, the angry black woman trope would rear its head to further diminish my feelings, and I’m depleted of energy to fight. I recognize that this is only the beginning. I’ve already built a tolerance to certain things, and I feel empowered by that. You have to chose your battles to win your wars, meaning I can’t call people out on every single microaggression. Besides, if I wanna be like my girl Mellody Hobson one day, suffice it to say, all this comes with the territory.
This entry has no concrete point, but it’s a reflection of my life right now. I’m not going anywhere. I haven’t advanced to the next level of anything. I’m sitting on my hands and taking bullshit classes that make me want to rip my eyebrows out. To have to do busy work like worksheets or watch an animated video explaining what an academic journal is feels like an insult to my intelligence. I’m not arrogant I just want and expect more from my educators.
I have been actively trying to transfer to other schools. The last time I went through the college application process, I was knocked on my ass. I didn’t meet my own expectations, and I had to bear the burden of not being the genius child I’d been made out to be. Dissatisfaction with yourself is even more crushing than disappointing others. I wrote about that feeling extensively because I knew, even then, that that part of my life wasn’t over. And now, when I look up transfer requirements, and see that housing isn’t guaranteed or that you need a 4.0 GPA, I clam up in fear that I’ll be knocked down yet again. Maybe, I’ll come out hardened and capable to take on this experience. That’s what I hope, that I’m prepared to do this again. But I’m a bit of a masochist. I work myself into the same frenzy as before and wonder, What do they want in a transfer student? Then scramble to deliver when there’s no surefire way to know what it is they want. I know better. I know better than to do this to myself, but alas. Immense stress is a small price to pay in the long run. If I don’t get in, I’m not sure if I’ll be able to recover this time; it feels as if there’s a lot on the line.
All I can do is hope Jesus guides the hand of whomever comes across my transfer application, because I’m on the verge of losing my mind. Some days, when I feel like going out of my way to find the good in everything, the idea that I might lose my mind seems like an exaggeration. The day of that dorm room conversation was a good day. I could get OK with this situation, I thought. As soon as everyone started airing the same grievances, I was so relieved! I’m not crazy, some spoiled brat who wants just what she wants. But, you know what? To a certain degree, I am. I want the world, Chico, and everything in it. I will not apologize for that. This place is a stepping stone, but if I want my dreams to come true? I have to know when to leave a situation that isn’t conducive to that. Wish me luck. ♦

I often draw comparisons between the changing natural landscapes of the seasons and the changing natural landscapes of my life. Most notable is my likening snirt (dirty snow) to the suppression of feelings. 
Recently, upon a lengthy walk home down a busy county road, on which suburban homeowners are likely to neglect the raking of their sidewalks, either because it still quite early in the autumn season, or because they are entitled assholes who think no one has to walk on streets in which cars exceed a speed of 35 miles per hour, I had a realization.
The leaves I tread upon represent my optimism, my excitement, and all that made me so nervously excited for the school year to begin in the last few weeks of summer, despite the approaching reintroduction of homework and having to time your pees as to not detract from your academic studies. 
In September, these leaves were green, still photosynthesizing on their respective trees. I was hopeful. They were hopeful. The score had not been set. We did not know what was coming. 
But, things always seem to disappoint. My grades are incapable of being anything but lackluster. My decision-making skills are incapable of being adequate. People are incapable of being anything but shitty. These are challenges. The leaves, once vibrantly green, try to adapt. They turn red, and yellow, and orange. It’s beautiful. 
It only lasts so long. The weather gets harsher. The leaves begin to give up. 
And in many ways, my experience is similar. I’ve let workloads defeat me. Instead of continuing to alter my flawed procrastination habits, I enjoy a peaceful four hours of sleep a night, staying up late, or waking up early to finish work I easily could’ve completed at a reasonable hour. Instead of developing skills which would reflect developing fiscal responsibility, I rely on the crumpled five dollar bills I occasionally find while doing laundry. I assume every boy to harbor malicious intent, and accept fitting treatment from them. I don’t demand respect, or change, from anything, or anyone, not even myself. 
Like the leaves, I tried. Albeit briefly and half-assedly. But it’s easier to just give up. To fall down, and be stepped on, and slowly disintegrate, and soon covered in snow and composted, and forgotten. ♦

I have this endless desire, no, hunger, to be normal. 
I don’t want to be interesting or different. I want to be regular and pretty.
I’m tired of looking at perfect girls—and by “perfect” I mean girls whose spines are straight, girls who don’t have scoliosis, girls whose self-esteem issues revolve around weight and stretch marks.
I wish that was what I worried about when it comes to my body, at least then there are other girls with whom to talk to about those things—other girls who are self-conscious about stretch marks and weight.
I don’t know any girls who wake up crying in the middle of the night because their spine looks like a distorted Leaning Tower of Pisa. More importantly, I don’t know girls whose spines—even after spinal fusion surgery—still stray dramatically from their bodies the way that mine does.
I hate me.
I’m thinking of destroying everything, moving to a remote island and being ugly by myself. ♦

The other day, I woke up feeling stressed out. But I decided to get over it and start my day with a smile. So I cleared my head, put a smile on my face, and headed toward school. I didn’t know how my day would unfold, but I was hoping for a good one. As I was waiting at the bus stop, a barefoot woman in her forties arrived. She was screaming and yelling at an imaginary person. Some people were scared of her, while others showed sympathy because they knew her and her story. 
Some of the bystanders explained that she had lost her whole family, that they were killed in front of her, and since then, she had lost it—her mind had become another victim of this bloody conflict. I tried to forget about her, and to continue with my day, but it was futile. Her face and her voice haunted me wherever I turned.
The traffic was horrific, too. Checkpoints were everywhere, adding hours to already prolonged commutes. Many people walk to work now in order to arrive on time. But however they get there—walking, on the bus or in their own cars—people arrive and they are already exhausted. How could anyone expect them to be productive?
On one corner right before school, there was a little boy, not older than five, sitting on the curb, begging for money. People begging for food and money are everywhere these days, but seeing a little child doing it, instead of being at school or playing with friends, breaks my heart. When I got to school, my friends showed me pictures of displaced Syrian families stuck at the borders of European countries, trying to find new lives illegally. Their faces show humiliation and exhaustion. How could I continue with my day after all of this?
I try. We all try to pretend that we have normal lives, but everything around simply fails us. Some people say that we should just get used to the situation. Why should one get used to pain? Sometimes we give up, and other times we console ourselves with empty and false words.
Don’t all human beings deserve to have one day—one normal day—when if they decide to face it with a smile, they are not beaten down?
What happened that day repeats itself in one way or another every single day. I am drowning in sadness and pain. The bitterness of my reality has even found its way into my own dreams, and my nights are now even worse than my days. The strangest thing is when people ask me, “What’s going on? You look exhausted!” But, isn’t everyone exhausted? Why do people ask? Don’t they know the answer already? It’s inscribed on the face of every Syrian.
I am still thinking about leaving and starting my life somewhere new. But what if my dreams of a decent life abroad are illusions? I am not sure, but I will try anyway. I feel that I’ve become a statue: I cannot work, study, or even make a decision. I am overwhelmed and exhausted and desperately looking for a way out of this abyss. ♦

There’s nothing like that sinking feeling when you hit the “on” button on your school-mandated, important-software-containing laptop and get—
darkness.
Blank space. An empty screen.
I came home for the weekend toting several pounds of then-useless scrap metal and plastic and dumped it onto my desk, staring at it accusingly. All of my homework was on that machine! All my photos of Ireland and goofy snapchats from my friends! How was I supposed to remember all my passwords when they were all stored on my in-browser keychain?!
Then I sat down on the couch and, devoid of my device, opened a book for the first time in what felt like ages. Went cover to cover on that baby. It had been a really long time since I had done that.
I’m in no way anti-technology. I’m typing this now on my very newly repaired, very precious laptop and wouldn’t have it any other way. My Ireland photos, dear to me as they are, sit safely on my hard drive (and now, after this near-disaster, in the cloud). But I also understand the purpose of wifi-free cafes and low- or no-tech vacations. I like flipping through books in libraries and taking notes by hand (how would I doodle in the margins otherwise?). Maybe this is obvious for some people—why would you get that attached to your computer? But it’s not so straightforward for me. My family and I use our devices a lot and I’m constantly surrounded by them at school; it’s too easy to keep wearing that blue-light mask even when I don’t need to be. And no, downloading f.lux doesn’t count for anything.
But maybe there’s hope for me yet. This weekend, after all, I missed my main gadget for all of two hours—before remembering that sometimes I’d rather get lost in ink on a page than pixels on a screen. ♦

I’m out of practice. I haven’t written a diary entry in two or three weeks and I don’t know why. The space between the end of October and the birth of November is one of much confusion, a time when we all seem to slip through the cracks and into a different state—a different world, even. On October 31, even the air seems to have been altered. By then, I think, we are already on some kind of parallel plane that does not belong to us and warps even further out of our understanding when we try to claim it as our own. I do not think that this is a novel concept, because different people and cultures have names for it: the spirit world, 1Q84, etc. But it is overlooked. 
November is a month of death. As a child I assigned colors, symbols, and moods to months, the way a synesthete may say that a song sounds like the yellow-brown of hay. November was always a raven, harbinger of gray seeping into school windows and initial goosebumps and the incurable cold preceding the smell of my living room radiator in December. 
I always wondered, simply out of curiosity, what month my mother would die in. I should have guessed November. I think it just seemed cruel to think that she would pass so close to her birthday, but the objectivity of the universe is: death is neither inherently good nor evil. 
It’s hard to be that rational when you have lost your best friend, your soulmate, someone who literally gave you life. No one is asking me to think in a cold, logical way about this though—so why am I trying to? Do I think it will be easier? (It’s not. It hurts.)
Last November, a week and a half before my mother passed away, a middle school friend was hit by a car and killed. I still remember the picture of the car from one of the articles published about it. Her death was labeled a pedestrian error—even reading about it now it seems like a nonsensical claim—and the investigation was closed. She was the first person to talk to me in sixth grade; I remember her telling me that she liked my headband. It was cheap and black with embedded gems and it broke before the year ended. She smiled when I said thank you, and I can still remember how full and rosy and bright her face was. In the memory, her face is glowing slightly, and I know that it was probably because of the sunlight streaming into the cafeteria but a part of me does not believe that that is all. 
I want to take all of the ugly blocks of text covering her death by way of PSAs reminding New Yorkers about crossing the street safely and replace them with the tender spot inside of me where she will always reside. 
When she was hit, I considered telling my mom the next time I visited her in the hospital. It was the last time I saw her alive. She was asleep, deeper than she’d ever been. I tried waking her up but the most I got were a few unintelligible sounds. “She’s really tired,” the nurse told me. “She’s had a lot of tests today.” I couldn’t bear to see her like that. I leaned down and gathered her in my arms as best as I could to hug her. I cried as I did—as I always did every time I hugged her in the hospital, although I would hide in her shoulder so she wouldn’t see—and left. 
I didn’t get to say goodbye
I didn’t get to say goodbye
I didn’t get to say goodbye
 —a mantra of pain and utmost mourning.
Death grips me with a heavy hand and it is enough to make me scream. 
My mother was cremated, not buried. There is no grey slab to soak up my excess tears, nowhere for me to show her some small form of tribute, no solid physical memorial. It doesn’t feel right. Nothing about this does. 
How do I stop treating my grief like a stranger? I am afraid to hurt. ♦

When I tell people that I’m both black and Mexican, or show them pictures of my parents, I receive a variety of responses. Here are some of my favorites: 
1. “That’s not your mom! Why would you lie about something like that? If you were Mexican you’d look it. And you would like spicy food!” 
2. “Oh you’re not fully black? Then why do you feel the need to speak on black issues? It’s none of your business.”
One time, a girl went full Mean Girls on me and asked, “If you’re Mexican, why are you black?
It was hard when I was little, being the non-confrontational youngster I was. If race or identity came up I would change the subject, not wanting to talk about it. As I got older and started attending a predominately white school I found that changing the subject wasn’t an option anymore; people were more persistent now, more opinionated. So, I spent countless hours on the internet, scrolling, watching, and reading until I had a good idea of what I believed. I went back to school feeling like this responsibility to educate my peers was a cool superwoman-like cape. Keianna to the rescue! 
I excitedly waited for the questions about my ethnicity or hair, ready to fire the asker with facts. About a week later, in fourth period, a group of girls who sat behind me, all of them white, tapped my shoulder. Noticing that I was listening to Kanye, they asked what song was playing. Once I’d given my answer I was, once again, ignored, unworthy of their conversation. I didn’t care, I had no plans to contribute anything more, until one of the girls turned to me and asked, “Is it OK if I say the N-word? I know people get so butthurt.” 
I was shocked. Even with all my knowledge and research, I didn’t know what to say. I stuttered something along the lines of, “No, it’s not your word to say.” Yes, the moment I was waiting for had came, but not as I expected.
She nastily informed me that I wasn’t even really “that black anyways.” I was a mutt who needed to get over it. She ended her rant by asking, “Why is it such a big deal anyways? I wasn’t around when slavery was a thing and neither were you.”
All at once, my cape morphed into an ugly sweater. It was no longer something to show off, it was something I wanted to throw into the back of my closet and forget about. Why would she ask me if I was OK with it and then get mad when I answered honestly? I was confused and highly upset, but instead of confronting her I ignored her and asked that my teacher move my seat. 
Over the next couple of days, I got the usual questions: “So, is it cultural appropriation if I do this?” Their inquiries were prompted by my telling my classmates that what they were saying to or in front of me wasn’t OK. Yet, I was now annoyed by even having to tell them what they were doing was wrong, let alone having to explain why. I had spent the time to educate myself, why couldn’t they do the same for themselves? 
The altercation with the girls left me confused and unsure. Sometimes people would come to me asking for advice and I’d feel the same annoyance I did when someone who didn’t care asked. How was I supposed to help people if I was constantly wary that they were secretly making fun of me? The fighter in me still wanted to make the school a better place: stopping altogether wasn’t an option.
I decided, with the help of some very amazing people, to adopt my math teacher’s mindset. Every day, before he starts teaching, he tells us that if we don’t want to learn we should go sit in the back and put our heads down so he can focus on the people who do. In my case, I’ll ignore all of those who don’t actually want my help, so that I can be ready and willing to teach the people who do. 
In conclusion, my cape’s back on, and I’m ready for action. Send out a signal if you need me. ♦

On November 14, 2015, at 2:12 PM, I became 17 years old.
I am 17 years old. I am 17 years old. I am 17 years old. 
I keep repeating this phrase to myself. Its very odd. 
It’s odd because 17 is so much bigger than 16. I can’t think of an age transition I’ve experienced as drastic as this one. 6 to 7 was a stepping stone. 12 to 13 allowed me to relate to a new demographic. But 16 to 17? 16 sounds like schoolgirl crushes, and bubblegum, and begging my mom to let me go to a concert with friends. 17 sounds like anguish, and freedom, and decisions, and all things adult. It sounds like rage, and sadness, and responsibility. It sounds like maturity. Yikes. 
17 has the potential to change the course of your life. It happened to Matthew Perry, and then he had to turn into Zac Efron so he could be 17 again, and re-change the course of his life. 
17 means only two more years of being a teenager. And 17 means only one more year of childhood, because 17 is one away from 18. And 18 is voting, and a changed legal status, and college, and the ability to buy a house. 18 means “I’m an adult!” can be used in argument with parents because 18 means, you’re actually, kind of, an adult. 
17 is serious in and of itself, because R-rated movies. No more sketchy diversions in movie theaters so I can see 21 or 22 Jump Street despite the MPAA thinking I can’t handle handle penis jokes. 23 Jump Street, here I come. Legally. 
I find myself watching “TRY TO WATCH WITHOUT LAUGHING—100 PERCENT IMPOSSIBLE” YouTube videos, and NOT laughing. I find myself fantasizing about the interior design of my future apartments. I no longer find myself intrigued by monkey bars and cash registers. I was compelled to try a crossword puzzle this weekend.
I don’t feel any different, but I know things are changing. 
I am getting old. ♦

The conflict in Syria has caused the displacement of many families. Unfortunately, those who escaped from their houses, fearing for their lives, are unable to afford the soaring rents in the relatively safe areas, such as Damascus. Many of them are forced to move in with friends or family members.
A friend of mine lives with 20 people in a two-bedroom apartment, and another lives with her two aunts and nine kids. Such scenarios are very common these days. The lack of stability and privacy makes life disastrous for both kids and adults.
I had never experienced such a situation personally until a few months ago. My father, may his soul rest in peace, and my mother after him, did all they could to provide us with stability and privacy. But, a few months ago, my aunt and her little kid moved in with us. She stayed with us for three months, and as soon as she left, my uncle and his four naughty kids moved in. His kids are very noisy and his little daughter, who has been sick for a while, does not stop crying. Although I feel for them all and I am happy that we can help, the situation annoys me a lot—I cannot study or sleep. Their mother is tired of them as well: Their frequent moving from one home to another has negatively affected their behavior. When they misbehave or are being too noisy, I run away to another room and close the door, but they follow me wherever I go. I sometimes lose patience and yell at them. 
I’ve come to hate being at home and I blame my mother for that. She retains her humanity and continues to follow her principle to “think of others.” She thinks of everyone else, but not her own kids. We are tired of taking care of others! She has turned our house into a rest area: Every time one of our relatives misses the bus back home at night, they stay at our place. Every time someone manages to get out of Ghouta, our place is their first stop. I blame her because she knows how pressured we are and that we don’t have the energy or the patience to take care of people. We suffered for a long time and nobody cared, why should we care for others now?
I stay at school even after class in order to minimize my time at home, but school has become really boring since most of my friends have left the country. The new situation at home has brought the idea of leaving the country back into my head. Leaving is what I concentrate on these days. Leaving is the only way to survive, or at least the only way to escape. I have no idea whether traveling will help me to realize my dreams, but at least it will get me out of here. I have to try. Don’t they say: To try and fail is better than not to try at all?
I got my passport and all the required documents to travel, but I do not have the money. I do not want to ask the guy I call my fiancé for money. I worry that if he helps me leave the country, I will have to marry him at some point. I would rather find my own way out, then meet with him—and then decide whether I want to marry him or not. This way, I will at least have some self-respect. However, in the meantime, I do not have the money and I am waiting for something to break through. ♦

I broke down crying to “Wiseman” by Frank Ocean. I was using the Trntbl website to look through all the songs I’ve posted on my Tumblr, looking back to see how I dealt with my depression before 18. “Wiseman closed his mouth, madman closed his fist,” Frank croons, and I smiled as if I hadn’t heard the song in decades, but each word rolled off my tongue like a relative’s nickname. Then those first eight lines ended and I wasn’t prepared for what he said next, “But your mother would be proud of you-uuu.” The ugliest sound escaped my mouth and tears ran down my face. 
“I bet your mother would be proud of you.” 
At 19, I’m supposed to have everything together. It’s not that “you’re nearing your 20s and you think you should have everything together when that’s not actually true” thing. It’s more that I was always expected to have it together mentally, at all times, because my single dad didn’t know how best to deal with my emotions. It wasn’t in him to be nurturing in that way, and that’s not his fault, it just wasn’t something we talked about. Whenever I had an anxiety attack or a breakdown he would tell me to calm down and keep my head up, advice that wasn’t helpful, at all. I had counselors to talk to at school, but there are so many conversations I have with myself that I’m supposed to be having with my mom, “OK, Thahabu, what’s wrong with you, how are you going to fix this?” I ask, then I have to struggle with myself to find solutions. I run in this never ending loop because I’m not my mom; I’m not even supposed to know a quarter of these answers. 
My mom has these answers but she’s dead, and since I never met her I’m not even aware that she’s the one I should be talking to. Not only am I crying about whatever screwed-up situation I’m in at the time, I also become frustrated with myself and cry harder because I feel something missing. Perhaps what I’m going through wouldn’t be that serious, if that something was there. It’s like screaming into an empty abyss. I feel helpless and pathetic, then an invisible freight train hits me in the chest and I realize the reason I’m going in circles is because my mom would be the one to answer these questions and help me in these situations. I’m unaware that I miss her because she’s never been around. I have no reference for or expectation of what my mother would do. It’s a very un-fucking-settling feeling. Although I do not know her she has such a huge effect on my life. My ninth grade English teacher described it perfectly, “Even though you never got a chance to meet her, you can still feel her absence,” which encapsulates how I’ve felt my entire life. My mother’s absence is so strong and apparent. It’s in the eyes of the loved ones she left behind, and in those moments when I’m lying in bed screaming for a reason I can’t come up with for five long minutes. 
She’s not here but she’s here, a truth eerily comforting but very painful. Physically painful. Sometimes, I start to feel as though I’ve forgotten something—you know that feeling, when you leave the house and you’re already far away, then dread fills you because you know something important is back at home but you just can’t put your finger on it? My stomach hollows and my chest tightens like a double-knotted shoelace. Am I supposed to be talking to someone or holding something? I’m confused and so is my body. Like me, it’s trying to cope with not having a mom. This is a merciless, lonely feeling. Her absence claws at the back of my neck. I know she’s supposed to be here with me. 
I’ve carried this emptiness since I was a child, moments like these aren’t new to me. Only, it’s gotten worse. There’s a larger, deeper, stronger emptiness. My high school guidance counselor told me that it’s natural for me to miss her, but unlike people who actually have memories of a dead parent, I’ll run into grief instead of it being triggered by remembering something about her. It’ll only get worse as I age because, as I grow into my womanhood, I’ll be met with more and more ask-your-mom experiences. I just have to become comfortable with it. I look like a person I’ve never met, a person I’m supposed to know. She’s missing my becoming a woman, and it’s making me more sad than it used to. 
And I’m scared. What if I’m not turning out the way she’d want me to? My dad tells me she would be proud of me, but with the grades I’m getting right now I’m not too sure. I need her most at this turning point in my life. I feel childish for feeling that way. The absence of someone who was supposed to be an integral part of my growth as a person is just as strong as losing someone I knew personally. It’s my invisible symptom. I’ll forever be encountering odd situations that wouldn’t be so odd if I had a mom. ♦

The perils of existing for more than 12 hours without sleep: A firm belief that I am still a fetus inside my mother’s womb; crying horrendously in front of my friends and strangers; not registering any word spoken in my direction.
I have become good at being lonely, even in front of the people I love and admire most. I keep on thinking about how everything in my life is fleeting—in a single snap they could be gone. But I’m not afraid. I’m just reeling, because it means I have to strive to make every second, minute, hour, day that I get to spend with people worthwhile. Kanye sings, “’Cause when you try hard that’s when you die hard.” That resonates.
I went home spent and tired last night. I dozed off the moment I hit the sack, although I was able to utter the words, “You’ve done well and enough today. Rest, my darling.” I’ve concluded that loneliness fits in my “life timeline;” I will befriend it. Why not, when loneliness makes me kinder, softer, more empathetic? ♦

This week, I made myself a spam account on Instagram, which is something a lot of my friends have been doing. I don’t really use it to post a bunch of excess pictures that don’t make it onto my main Instagram account (because, let’s be real, I post a lot of miscellaneous things on my Instagram anyway), but as a “safe” space for me to talk about what’s going on in my life to people I don’t really know. 
I used to be very cautious about making sure no one I knew in person followed me. Nowadays I don’t care, but one disadvantage of not caring is that I can’t talk about everything I’d like to because I’m scared of hurting people’s feelings. Because I don’t have a “personal” account, I can’t separate the people I know IRL from all my followers. Now that I have this separate, private account, where I can talk about how I’m feeling without worrying who sees, I feel so much better. I’ve been able get some things off of my chest. 
Even so, I still get nervous that someone will expose me for saying something about a friend—by showing it to that friend or something—so I change the names of the people I talk about. When I say “talk about” it seems like a catty thing, but friendships aren’t all going to be 100 percent happy at all times! I really hate conflict with friends—I’ve probably only had two arguments with my best friend—and, even then, whatever happens usually isn’t huge. Often, the issue is something that isn’t big enough to bring up, but is too important to not talk about at all. Still, when I say “talk about” I’m nervous that it makes me sound two-faced or something when really, I’m just trying to not bottle everything so that I don’t blow up on a friend for something stupid like drinking the rest of my water. ♦

Last year, my English teacher said something about how your body knows to hold off being sick or faulty when you’re under a lot of pressure. If you have a huge project that you’ve been doing for two weeks and during that time you’ve been exposed to a cold, your body will be like, “I’m way too busy to deal with this right now,” and it’ll just chill. BUT, once that project is over and you have a three-day weekend or something, that cold will pop up. She was saying that your body doesn’t want to overwhelm you, or that it knows when to fit things in so that you can keep going without too much trouble. 
I don’t think that’s exactly what’s happening to me but now that fall break is here, I’ve slept so so much. All the sleep I’ve been missing over the week just caught up to me and it’s nice to think back to what my teacher said when things like this happen.
It being fall break makes me really excited, because it means winter break is coming really soon, and that will take us into the new year, which actually makes me kinda nervous! The January to June part of the school year passes really quickly, and a lot of my friends are seniors who are graduating soon. Which also means that I’m going to be a senior soon. My mom has been bugging me a lot about college things, and that freaks me out because I have no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life! I don’t even know how college really works. I just wish time would slow down and let me catch up. ♦

For a long time, my mother had us living in a bubble with unrealistic moral standards. The crisis in Syria has forced us out of that bubble, and we are finally facing reality. Throughout the past few years, we’ve had contact with all kinds of people, in shelters and, later on, in our own place, when we’ve embraced friends and relatives in need of help. We’ve witnessed heated fights, bad language, and some violence. Although we understand the effort our mother made in order to protect us, we also now feel that we do not belong to the world in which we live, a world in which everything is very foreign to us. Time, work, and school have also contributed to expanding my horizons, and have provided me with opportunities to learn more about life outside of the bubble in which we grew up. I find myself being gradually immersed in this new world and its standards. This could be my way of rejecting my mother’s authority, or revolting against my old, well-organized world—I do not know.
I have developed a temper. I hurt people’s feelings easily, and I’ve lost the capacity for forgiveness and patience that I used to have. I fight with my siblings and explode with anger, even with my mother, who keeps trying to contain me. I am not even nice to my friends anymore, and I keep losing them, one after another. I feel that hatred has possessed me. I hate everything around me. I’ve become a mean person, even with little kids. Can you believe it?
I do not have respect for anything or anybody, and I’m afraid that I will soon lose my self-respect—that will be the absolute end. I do not enjoy being around people anymore, and I spend most of my time alone. I do so because I am scared that the monster that has grown inside of me over the past few years might come out and hurt those I love. Have I developed this from those I have had contact with, like a kind of disease? Is it bred by the chaos that we are living in? Or is it because of this bloody war? I do not know. 
I am scared. I am really scared. I do not know what’s in store for us. I cannot take our current situation anymore, and I am afraid that the future will be even harsher. I have been silent recently; silence is my new shelter in this reality that I cannot change. Will it be my end as well? ♦

I just got home from a poetry reading called LitOrgy, in my city. It was invigorating to hear from every passionate soul the thirst for freedom, for expression, for catharsis; to hear people, 17 and older, share recollections, well-kept memories, and longings. The whole experience was basically like being god, seeing through everyone’s hearts and souls.
The literary scene in my city, Davao, is thriving, and every year that LitOrgy is celebrated, I see and hear new faces and stories. It’s wonderful to think of what passion can make you do. And these people, the founders of LitOrgy, have been through so much and now they are being offered new people, new stories, bigger event locations, more patrons every single year. It’s amazing what hard work or perseverance, or whatever you’d like to call it, can do.
I remember wishing, “I want to become smart and hardworking” as I listened to a young professor read an excerpt from his short story wherein he raises the question: “What do you wanna be—smart, rich, or beautiful?” I wanna be smart and hardworking! Smart and hardworking, smart and hardworking, smart and hardworking…. I kept this mantra in my mind for as long as I could. My mind asks, Why?
Because I wanna initiate change. I want upheaval, grit-and-bone, and reactions, and gasps. Whatever, I just want to create and love for as long as I live.

All I’ve ever wanted is to be happy. Right now, I’m in a state of being where all I can do is watch myself from the outside, unable to truly control myself. It’s not the lack of control of my inhibitions, it’s more that now that I’m no longer in therapy and have stopped having this outlet I feel stuck in a state of a OK-ness, of fine—but fine isn’t enough. I know that one can’t experience happiness constantly, but I’m fed up. My emotions go up and down like anyone’s but, still, all I want is to be happy, not just this contentedness, this boring, bland part of life. 
The thing is, I don’t know how to achieve happiness. I’ve moved schools, I’ve made new friends, I’ve become more me than I ever have been—as a feminist and queer teenager. I have a wonderful family, amazing friends. What’s left? My brain goes back to that word, relationship, the type of relationship that I am currently craving. Every time I bring this up I’m told that “someone will be just around the corner” and “if you stop looking they will come.” But I’ve been feeling alone and kind of empty for a long time and it’s not as though I’m not looking for a fairy tale or that story book kind of love or romance, but just for once in my life when I love someone could they not love me back. Love me back equally, love me back more, love me in the way I have not been loved before. ♦

I have two or three weeks before the fall semester ends. Word documents and French homework will no longer keep me up past 2 AM, at least until January. I’m excited to go home. I miss being able to spend as much time as I want in the shower while singing along to Beyoncé.
My friends are planning a big New Year’s Eve extravaganza, but I don’t think I’ll have the money for it, we’ll have to see. I don’t really like elaborate plans for parties, because they’re never as fun as you plan them to be.
I’m feeling OK at the moment, but I’m afraid my spinal curve might be growing. I had the same feeling when I was 16, but I was just being paranoid. It’s hard for your spinal curve to grow after the surgery but it’s still possible. I probably think it’s moving because my body is changing. I hope it’s just that and nothing else because I don’t want to go under the knife ever again. It’s one of my biggest fears. ♦

On Saturday, I had a Halloween party and it was pretty wonderful. All the people I love the most came and made an effort with fabulous costumes. My original besties, Sophie and Rebecca came as Harley Quinn and a slytherin student respectively—Rebecca made hers and her boyfriends costumes. My new besties Kiah and Rachel came as a vampire and a dead Cleopatra. We also had a Minnie and Mickey Mouse, the joker, and a werewolf, among other things.
The Friday before, my mum and I went shopping for nachos, sweets, and a lot of alcohol, stocking up the house. On Saturday morning, my parents and I build a gazebo in our back garden and my mum and I decorated the house with shop-bought decorations and our own creative genius. I started getting ready around 5 PM, and friends who were sleeping over arrived early to get ready with me. Guests trickled in between 7 and 8 PM and soon the party was on a roll.
People drank, talked, and danced. I made some nachos and sometime later my mum brought in many buckets of KFC and chips. For me, the best part of the evening was karaoke: I went for my favourite number: “I’ve Got a Crush on You” which I sang vaguely in the direction of the person on whom I have a crush. We went through a collection of classics and new pop and everyone ended up burned out and tired. By this point, it was well into the night and people began to leave slowly. Parents arrived in cars, cabs were called, and the drunk teenage mass disappeared, leaving only me and four of my wonderful friends. Soon we were four, and then three.
In my room, we made up some floor beds and attempted sleep. But what happens at sleepovers? You talk into the early hours about the most trivial and the realest things. I proceeded to drunk tweet my feelings. Not so bad, at least it wasn’t Facebook. ♦

Countless events of police brutality and social uprising have been throwing my anxiety through roof. The current political and racial climate in this country is exposing the true faces of my so-called friends. I’ll be grateful for it in the long run, but it’s still disheartening to learn that the people who I thought cared about me think they can dictate how I and others react to oppression. 
Back in August, two girls from the Seattle chapter of Black Lives Matter disturbed a Bernie Sanders rally to demand that he be more explicit about his plans for addressing the civil rights of black people in the U.S.. While one girl broke out in tears yelling, “My life matters,” she was met with people shouting, “Fuck you’” and “How dare you call me a racist?” from the mostly white, supposedly liberal crowd. 
I stand with those young ladies, regardless how they handled themselves, and I made a Facebook status about it for everyone to see. One of these friends commented on the status saying she disagreed. She even had the nerve to reference my “The Right to Be a Black Girl” essay as an example of how black people should express anger: “She’s angry, and rightfully so, but I don’t think she’s channeling it correctly. She just sounds angry, not necessarily smart about what she’s doing. Like, you’re angry, but that article you wrote about misogynoir was educated and eloquent. I’m not getting that from her.” 
First off, the fact that she even referenced my essay—that totally rejects policing the way black girls express themselves, especially when it comes to anger or sadness—tells me that the point of the piece totally missed her. Saying Black people need to be “eloquent” and “educated” when fighting for our rights is racist and, frankly, stupid. 
I told her she had no right to tell black people how to “channel” their anger when they’re grieving the deaths and brutalization of their people. Just because I sounded “eloquent” in my essay doesn’t mean I always sound that way, particularly when I’m talking about state-sanctioned violence. 
She also said the protesters were tarnishing the the public’s perspective of the Black Lives Matter movement, as if liberation movements don’t have different sectors. Just as the civil rights movement included more militant groups like the Black Panthers and the non-violent teachings of Martin Luther King, there are going to be different groups using different strategies to achieve the same goal: freedom. 
Her ideas suggest there is an “appropriate” way to demand human rights, that there is a “proper” way to ask someone to stop killing you. 
I don’t have to sound educated when I’m distraught about tragedy, and neither did those girls. All I got from those comments is, if I ever ever became unapologetically irate about the denial of humanity to black people, she wouldn’t stand with me, simply because it doesn’t fit her idea of how people should fight for their lives. That was heartbreaking. 
I’ve been avoiding her ever since. ♦

The first time I went to Los Angeles and actually walked around was at the start of this year, for the Rookie Yearbook Three dance party. It was great knowing that I could wear a dress with tights in sandals and have it be seen as a fashion statement rather than a DUI (dressing under the influence), as most fashions beyond Hollister and Forever 21 are deemed in my corner of suburbia. Despite feeling very liberated in that way, I was more arms-crossed-and-head-down than ever. I had this premonition with every step I took down Sunset Boulevard that someone was going to jump out from the gutter and try to take me and/or my Band of Horses LP (Amoeba!) with them. L.A. also triggered my extreme sense of ambition: How to make it in L.A? When people look down on you from high buildings as if you’re an ant, how can a person become queen of the colony? I felt terribly defeated, and kept expecting someone to step on my tiny, ant self with their heel at any minute.
At the event, I surrendered to the influence of the Rookie fandom. Not that I wasn’t truly one of the biggest SuperRooks out there, but becoming another atom in the Rook molecule definitely helped me to become more comfortable in this endless sidewalk called Los Angeles. 
This past weekend, I walked through L.A. hardly having to remind myself to breathe. I was there for the Rookie Yearbook Four party. Instead of feeling like an indent on the cement, I was a prominent bump on the face of Los Angeles, one that would need lots of concealer to cover. 
However good it felt to not want to evaporate this time around, everything was also demystified. L.A. no longer felt like stumbling upon a great series, 15 seasons of which are all on Netflix. The evening was a short film: a concentration of good thoughts and great characters that ended quickly, barely leaving a sweet taste in your mouth. The climax was quickly conquered, and I go back in time and replay it, trying to feel one melancholy way or another.
I said goodbye, this time, with a quick wave and a smile rather than a curtsey and a longing gaze lasting until the end of the 101. ♦

As all of us piled into a newfound friend’s dorm room, I began to understand the value in making the best of an unwanted situation. Everyone in that room went in circles to introduce themselves, their majors, and their disdain for the state school we’d all landed at. The most refreshing part of the conversation was hearing about other people’s failed attempts to enter the golden gates of Ivy League institutions, about weighing options based on financial aid packages, and having to defer acceptances at dream schools because of money.
It was a weird conversation to veer into after a night of dancing. I had just left a Halloween party and my search for an after-party landed me meeting new people. I was happy to, as I need new friends to help the time go by before I transfer away. The last few weeks have consisted of me consoling old friends about their mental health and an inability to stay on campus. The campus was designed by an architect who previously built women’s prisons; it has a certain Bedford Hills vibe about it. All the brown, drab, brick buildings are connected underground and the hallways feel seedy (like a ’70s exploitation movie about women in prison—you know the ones).
I have to give the school credit for effort. They invest a lot in creating an environment fertile for creativity. As a fan of music, I have access to so many new sounds, since the school pays bands to perform here. They got extra cool points with me for having Zadie Smith swing by. But, in the grand scheme of things, NYU’s artist in residence is Pharrell Williams, so I’m no longer impressed. My school has all kinds of progressive programs and seminars on consent and seems to root its curricula in social justice. Although this often translates as Tumblresque feminism—and by that I mean, not intersectional at all—the effort doesn’t go unnoticed.
But, in class, much like on the internet, people hop on the bandwagon of thought, and in an attempt to satisfy everyone, nothing goes challenged. New ideas aren’t presented if they challenge a dominant narrative already deemed radical and “inclusive” to everyone (they aren’t). As a result, things become stagnant and there is a repetitiveness to our topics of discussion.
I signed up for a liberal arts education, but what even is the value of that in 2015? I could change my area of study, but the STEM programs here aren’t great. Soon, I’ll meet with my advisor to enroll in classes for next semester and there is still the possibility that I won’t be able to take classes pertaining to the things I like. I could give a fuck about seniors getting first choice in class enrollment when I’m paying my money like everyone else. College was supposed to be different from high school—a place of refuge. And it is very different while also maintaining enough sameness for me to oppose it.
And don’t even get me started on my College Writing professor. His self-absorbed bullshit is borderline unbearable. Not to mention that he actively seeks to undermine my accomplishments or over-explain things to me as if I can’t grasp them. I constantly have to prove myself and it’s literally the most frustrating thing ever. If I were to go off about it, the angry black woman trope would rear its head to further diminish my feelings, and I’m depleted of energy to fight. I recognize that this is only the beginning. I’ve already built a tolerance to certain things, and I feel empowered by that. You have to chose your battles to win your wars, meaning I can’t call people out on every single microaggression. Besides, if I wanna be like my girl Mellody Hobson one day, suffice it to say, all this comes with the territory.
This entry has no concrete point, but it’s a reflection of my life right now. I’m not going anywhere. I haven’t advanced to the next level of anything. I’m sitting on my hands and taking bullshit classes that make me want to rip my eyebrows out. To have to do busy work like worksheets or watch an animated video explaining what an academic journal is feels like an insult to my intelligence. I’m not arrogant I just want and expect more from my educators.
I have been actively trying to transfer to other schools. The last time I went through the college application process, I was knocked on my ass. I didn’t meet my own expectations, and I had to bear the burden of not being the genius child I’d been made out to be. Dissatisfaction with yourself is even more crushing than disappointing others. I wrote about that feeling extensively because I knew, even then, that that part of my life wasn’t over. And now, when I look up transfer requirements, and see that housing isn’t guaranteed or that you need a 4.0 GPA, I clam up in fear that I’ll be knocked down yet again. Maybe, I’ll come out hardened and capable to take on this experience. That’s what I hope, that I’m prepared to do this again. But I’m a bit of a masochist. I work myself into the same frenzy as before and wonder, What do they want in a transfer student? Then scramble to deliver when there’s no surefire way to know what it is they want. I know better. I know better than to do this to myself, but alas. Immense stress is a small price to pay in the long run. If I don’t get in, I’m not sure if I’ll be able to recover this time; it feels as if there’s a lot on the line.
All I can do is hope Jesus guides the hand of whomever comes across my transfer application, because I’m on the verge of losing my mind. Some days, when I feel like going out of my way to find the good in everything, the idea that I might lose my mind seems like an exaggeration. The day of that dorm room conversation was a good day. I could get OK with this situation, I thought. As soon as everyone started airing the same grievances, I was so relieved! I’m not crazy, some spoiled brat who wants just what she wants. But, you know what? To a certain degree, I am. I want the world, Chico, and everything in it. I will not apologize for that. This place is a stepping stone, but if I want my dreams to come true? I have to know when to leave a situation that isn’t conducive to that. Wish me luck. ♦

I often draw comparisons between the changing natural landscapes of the seasons and the changing natural landscapes of my life. Most notable is my likening snirt (dirty snow) to the suppression of feelings. 
Recently, upon a lengthy walk home down a busy county road, on which suburban homeowners are likely to neglect the raking of their sidewalks, either because it still quite early in the autumn season, or because they are entitled assholes who think no one has to walk on streets in which cars exceed a speed of 35 miles per hour, I had a realization.
The leaves I tread upon represent my optimism, my excitement, and all that made me so nervously excited for the school year to begin in the last few weeks of summer, despite the approaching reintroduction of homework and having to time your pees as to not detract from your academic studies. 
In September, these leaves were green, still photosynthesizing on their respective trees. I was hopeful. They were hopeful. The score had not been set. We did not know what was coming. 
But, things always seem to disappoint. My grades are incapable of being anything but lackluster. My decision-making skills are incapable of being adequate. People are incapable of being anything but shitty. These are challenges. The leaves, once vibrantly green, try to adapt. They turn red, and yellow, and orange. It’s beautiful. 
It only lasts so long. The weather gets harsher. The leaves begin to give up. 
And in many ways, my experience is similar. I’ve let workloads defeat me. Instead of continuing to alter my flawed procrastination habits, I enjoy a peaceful four hours of sleep a night, staying up late, or waking up early to finish work I easily could’ve completed at a reasonable hour. Instead of developing skills which would reflect developing fiscal responsibility, I rely on the crumpled five dollar bills I occasionally find while doing laundry. I assume every boy to harbor malicious intent, and accept fitting treatment from them. I don’t demand respect, or change, from anything, or anyone, not even myself. 
Like the leaves, I tried. Albeit briefly and half-assedly. But it’s easier to just give up. To fall down, and be stepped on, and slowly disintegrate, and soon covered in snow and composted, and forgotten. ♦

I have this endless desire, no, hunger, to be normal. 
I don’t want to be interesting or different. I want to be regular and pretty.
I’m tired of looking at perfect girls—and by “perfect” I mean girls whose spines are straight, girls who don’t have scoliosis, girls whose self-esteem issues revolve around weight and stretch marks.
I wish that was what I worried about when it comes to my body, at least then there are other girls with whom to talk to about those things—other girls who are self-conscious about stretch marks and weight.
I don’t know any girls who wake up crying in the middle of the night because their spine looks like a distorted Leaning Tower of Pisa. More importantly, I don’t know girls whose spines—even after spinal fusion surgery—still stray dramatically from their bodies the way that mine does.
I hate me.
I’m thinking of destroying everything, moving to a remote island and being ugly by myself. ♦

The other day, I woke up feeling stressed out. But I decided to get over it and start my day with a smile. So I cleared my head, put a smile on my face, and headed toward school. I didn’t know how my day would unfold, but I was hoping for a good one. As I was waiting at the bus stop, a barefoot woman in her forties arrived. She was screaming and yelling at an imaginary person. Some people were scared of her, while others showed sympathy because they knew her and her story. 
Some of the bystanders explained that she had lost her whole family, that they were killed in front of her, and since then, she had lost it—her mind had become another victim of this bloody conflict. I tried to forget about her, and to continue with my day, but it was futile. Her face and her voice haunted me wherever I turned.
The traffic was horrific, too. Checkpoints were everywhere, adding hours to already prolonged commutes. Many people walk to work now in order to arrive on time. But however they get there—walking, on the bus or in their own cars—people arrive and they are already exhausted. How could anyone expect them to be productive?
On one corner right before school, there was a little boy, not older than five, sitting on the curb, begging for money. People begging for food and money are everywhere these days, but seeing a little child doing it, instead of being at school or playing with friends, breaks my heart. When I got to school, my friends showed me pictures of displaced Syrian families stuck at the borders of European countries, trying to find new lives illegally. Their faces show humiliation and exhaustion. How could I continue with my day after all of this?
I try. We all try to pretend that we have normal lives, but everything around simply fails us. Some people say that we should just get used to the situation. Why should one get used to pain? Sometimes we give up, and other times we console ourselves with empty and false words.
Don’t all human beings deserve to have one day—one normal day—when if they decide to face it with a smile, they are not beaten down?
What happened that day repeats itself in one way or another every single day. I am drowning in sadness and pain. The bitterness of my reality has even found its way into my own dreams, and my nights are now even worse than my days. The strangest thing is when people ask me, “What’s going on? You look exhausted!” But, isn’t everyone exhausted? Why do people ask? Don’t they know the answer already? It’s inscribed on the face of every Syrian.
I am still thinking about leaving and starting my life somewhere new. But what if my dreams of a decent life abroad are illusions? I am not sure, but I will try anyway. I feel that I’ve become a statue: I cannot work, study, or even make a decision. I am overwhelmed and exhausted and desperately looking for a way out of this abyss. ♦

There’s nothing like that sinking feeling when you hit the “on” button on your school-mandated, important-software-containing laptop and get—
darkness.
Blank space. An empty screen.
I came home for the weekend toting several pounds of then-useless scrap metal and plastic and dumped it onto my desk, staring at it accusingly. All of my homework was on that machine! All my photos of Ireland and goofy snapchats from my friends! How was I supposed to remember all my passwords when they were all stored on my in-browser keychain?!
Then I sat down on the couch and, devoid of my device, opened a book for the first time in what felt like ages. Went cover to cover on that baby. It had been a really long time since I had done that.
I’m in no way anti-technology. I’m typing this now on my very newly repaired, very precious laptop and wouldn’t have it any other way. My Ireland photos, dear to me as they are, sit safely on my hard drive (and now, after this near-disaster, in the cloud). But I also understand the purpose of wifi-free cafes and low- or no-tech vacations. I like flipping through books in libraries and taking notes by hand (how would I doodle in the margins otherwise?). Maybe this is obvious for some people—why would you get that attached to your computer? But it’s not so straightforward for me. My family and I use our devices a lot and I’m constantly surrounded by them at school; it’s too easy to keep wearing that blue-light mask even when I don’t need to be. And no, downloading f.lux doesn’t count for anything.
But maybe there’s hope for me yet. This weekend, after all, I missed my main gadget for all of two hours—before remembering that sometimes I’d rather get lost in ink on a page than pixels on a screen. ♦

I’m out of practice. I haven’t written a diary entry in two or three weeks and I don’t know why. The space between the end of October and the birth of November is one of much confusion, a time when we all seem to slip through the cracks and into a different state—a different world, even. On October 31, even the air seems to have been altered. By then, I think, we are already on some kind of parallel plane that does not belong to us and warps even further out of our understanding when we try to claim it as our own. I do not think that this is a novel concept, because different people and cultures have names for it: the spirit world, 1Q84, etc. But it is overlooked. 
November is a month of death. As a child I assigned colors, symbols, and moods to months, the way a synesthete may say that a song sounds like the yellow-brown of hay. November was always a raven, harbinger of gray seeping into school windows and initial goosebumps and the incurable cold preceding the smell of my living room radiator in December. 
I always wondered, simply out of curiosity, what month my mother would die in. I should have guessed November. I think it just seemed cruel to think that she would pass so close to her birthday, but the objectivity of the universe is: death is neither inherently good nor evil. 
It’s hard to be that rational when you have lost your best friend, your soulmate, someone who literally gave you life. No one is asking me to think in a cold, logical way about this though—so why am I trying to? Do I think it will be easier? (It’s not. It hurts.)
Last November, a week and a half before my mother passed away, a middle school friend was hit by a car and killed. I still remember the picture of the car from one of the articles published about it. Her death was labeled a pedestrian error—even reading about it now it seems like a nonsensical claim—and the investigation was closed. She was the first person to talk to me in sixth grade; I remember her telling me that she liked my headband. It was cheap and black with embedded gems and it broke before the year ended. She smiled when I said thank you, and I can still remember how full and rosy and bright her face was. In the memory, her face is glowing slightly, and I know that it was probably because of the sunlight streaming into the cafeteria but a part of me does not believe that that is all. 
I want to take all of the ugly blocks of text covering her death by way of PSAs reminding New Yorkers about crossing the street safely and replace them with the tender spot inside of me where she will always reside. 
When she was hit, I considered telling my mom the next time I visited her in the hospital. It was the last time I saw her alive. She was asleep, deeper than she’d ever been. I tried waking her up but the most I got were a few unintelligible sounds. “She’s really tired,” the nurse told me. “She’s had a lot of tests today.” I couldn’t bear to see her like that. I leaned down and gathered her in my arms as best as I could to hug her. I cried as I did—as I always did every time I hugged her in the hospital, although I would hide in her shoulder so she wouldn’t see—and left. 
I didn’t get to say goodbye
I didn’t get to say goodbye
I didn’t get to say goodbye
 —a mantra of pain and utmost mourning.
Death grips me with a heavy hand and it is enough to make me scream. 
My mother was cremated, not buried. There is no grey slab to soak up my excess tears, nowhere for me to show her some small form of tribute, no solid physical memorial. It doesn’t feel right. Nothing about this does. 
How do I stop treating my grief like a stranger? I am afraid to hurt. ♦

When I tell people that I’m both black and Mexican, or show them pictures of my parents, I receive a variety of responses. Here are some of my favorites: 
1. “That’s not your mom! Why would you lie about something like that? If you were Mexican you’d look it. And you would like spicy food!” 
2. “Oh you’re not fully black? Then why do you feel the need to speak on black issues? It’s none of your business.”
One time, a girl went full Mean Girls on me and asked, “If you’re Mexican, why are you black?
It was hard when I was little, being the non-confrontational youngster I was. If race or identity came up I would change the subject, not wanting to talk about it. As I got older and started attending a predominately white school I found that changing the subject wasn’t an option anymore; people were more persistent now, more opinionated. So, I spent countless hours on the internet, scrolling, watching, and reading until I had a good idea of what I believed. I went back to school feeling like this responsibility to educate my peers was a cool superwoman-like cape. Keianna to the rescue! 
I excitedly waited for the questions about my ethnicity or hair, ready to fire the asker with facts. About a week later, in fourth period, a group of girls who sat behind me, all of them white, tapped my shoulder. Noticing that I was listening to Kanye, they asked what song was playing. Once I’d given my answer I was, once again, ignored, unworthy of their conversation. I didn’t care, I had no plans to contribute anything more, until one of the girls turned to me and asked, “Is it OK if I say the N-word? I know people get so butthurt.” 
I was shocked. Even with all my knowledge and research, I didn’t know what to say. I stuttered something along the lines of, “No, it’s not your word to say.” Yes, the moment I was waiting for had came, but not as I expected.
She nastily informed me that I wasn’t even really “that black anyways.” I was a mutt who needed to get over it. She ended her rant by asking, “Why is it such a big deal anyways? I wasn’t around when slavery was a thing and neither were you.”
All at once, my cape morphed into an ugly sweater. It was no longer something to show off, it was something I wanted to throw into the back of my closet and forget about. Why would she ask me if I was OK with it and then get mad when I answered honestly? I was confused and highly upset, but instead of confronting her I ignored her and asked that my teacher move my seat. 
Over the next couple of days, I got the usual questions: “So, is it cultural appropriation if I do this?” Their inquiries were prompted by my telling my classmates that what they were saying to or in front of me wasn’t OK. Yet, I was now annoyed by even having to tell them what they were doing was wrong, let alone having to explain why. I had spent the time to educate myself, why couldn’t they do the same for themselves? 
The altercation with the girls left me confused and unsure. Sometimes people would come to me asking for advice and I’d feel the same annoyance I did when someone who didn’t care asked. How was I supposed to help people if I was constantly wary that they were secretly making fun of me? The fighter in me still wanted to make the school a better place: stopping altogether wasn’t an option.
I decided, with the help of some very amazing people, to adopt my math teacher’s mindset. Every day, before he starts teaching, he tells us that if we don’t want to learn we should go sit in the back and put our heads down so he can focus on the people who do. In my case, I’ll ignore all of those who don’t actually want my help, so that I can be ready and willing to teach the people who do. 
In conclusion, my cape’s back on, and I’m ready for action. Send out a signal if you need me. ♦

On November 14, 2015, at 2:12 PM, I became 17 years old.
I am 17 years old. I am 17 years old. I am 17 years old. 
I keep repeating this phrase to myself. Its very odd. 
It’s odd because 17 is so much bigger than 16. I can’t think of an age transition I’ve experienced as drastic as this one. 6 to 7 was a stepping stone. 12 to 13 allowed me to relate to a new demographic. But 16 to 17? 16 sounds like schoolgirl crushes, and bubblegum, and begging my mom to let me go to a concert with friends. 17 sounds like anguish, and freedom, and decisions, and all things adult. It sounds like rage, and sadness, and responsibility. It sounds like maturity. Yikes. 
17 has the potential to change the course of your life. It happened to Matthew Perry, and then he had to turn into Zac Efron so he could be 17 again, and re-change the course of his life. 
17 means only two more years of being a teenager. And 17 means only one more year of childhood, because 17 is one away from 18. And 18 is voting, and a changed legal status, and college, and the ability to buy a house. 18 means “I’m an adult!” can be used in argument with parents because 18 means, you’re actually, kind of, an adult. 
17 is serious in and of itself, because R-rated movies. No more sketchy diversions in movie theaters so I can see 21 or 22 Jump Street despite the MPAA thinking I can’t handle handle penis jokes. 23 Jump Street, here I come. Legally. 
I find myself watching “TRY TO WATCH WITHOUT LAUGHING—100 PERCENT IMPOSSIBLE” YouTube videos, and NOT laughing. I find myself fantasizing about the interior design of my future apartments. I no longer find myself intrigued by monkey bars and cash registers. I was compelled to try a crossword puzzle this weekend.
I don’t feel any different, but I know things are changing. 
I am getting old. ♦

The conflict in Syria has caused the displacement of many families. Unfortunately, those who escaped from their houses, fearing for their lives, are unable to afford the soaring rents in the relatively safe areas, such as Damascus. Many of them are forced to move in with friends or family members.
A friend of mine lives with 20 people in a two-bedroom apartment, and another lives with her two aunts and nine kids. Such scenarios are very common these days. The lack of stability and privacy makes life disastrous for both kids and adults.
I had never experienced such a situation personally until a few months ago. My father, may his soul rest in peace, and my mother after him, did all they could to provide us with stability and privacy. But, a few months ago, my aunt and her little kid moved in with us. She stayed with us for three months, and as soon as she left, my uncle and his four naughty kids moved in. His kids are very noisy and his little daughter, who has been sick for a while, does not stop crying. Although I feel for them all and I am happy that we can help, the situation annoys me a lot—I cannot study or sleep. Their mother is tired of them as well: Their frequent moving from one home to another has negatively affected their behavior. When they misbehave or are being too noisy, I run away to another room and close the door, but they follow me wherever I go. I sometimes lose patience and yell at them. 
I’ve come to hate being at home and I blame my mother for that. She retains her humanity and continues to follow her principle to “think of others.” She thinks of everyone else, but not her own kids. We are tired of taking care of others! She has turned our house into a rest area: Every time one of our relatives misses the bus back home at night, they stay at our place. Every time someone manages to get out of Ghouta, our place is their first stop. I blame her because she knows how pressured we are and that we don’t have the energy or the patience to take care of people. We suffered for a long time and nobody cared, why should we care for others now?
I stay at school even after class in order to minimize my time at home, but school has become really boring since most of my friends have left the country. The new situation at home has brought the idea of leaving the country back into my head. Leaving is what I concentrate on these days. Leaving is the only way to survive, or at least the only way to escape. I have no idea whether traveling will help me to realize my dreams, but at least it will get me out of here. I have to try. Don’t they say: To try and fail is better than not to try at all?
I got my passport and all the required documents to travel, but I do not have the money. I do not want to ask the guy I call my fiancé for money. I worry that if he helps me leave the country, I will have to marry him at some point. I would rather find my own way out, then meet with him—and then decide whether I want to marry him or not. This way, I will at least have some self-respect. However, in the meantime, I do not have the money and I am waiting for something to break through. ♦

I broke down crying to “Wiseman” by Frank Ocean. I was using the Trntbl website to look through all the songs I’ve posted on my Tumblr, looking back to see how I dealt with my depression before 18. “Wiseman closed his mouth, madman closed his fist,” Frank croons, and I smiled as if I hadn’t heard the song in decades, but each word rolled off my tongue like a relative’s nickname. Then those first eight lines ended and I wasn’t prepared for what he said next, “But your mother would be proud of you-uuu.” The ugliest sound escaped my mouth and tears ran down my face. 
“I bet your mother would be proud of you.” 
At 19, I’m supposed to have everything together. It’s not that “you’re nearing your 20s and you think you should have everything together when that’s not actually true” thing. It’s more that I was always expected to have it together mentally, at all times, because my single dad didn’t know how best to deal with my emotions. It wasn’t in him to be nurturing in that way, and that’s not his fault, it just wasn’t something we talked about. Whenever I had an anxiety attack or a breakdown he would tell me to calm down and keep my head up, advice that wasn’t helpful, at all. I had counselors to talk to at school, but there are so many conversations I have with myself that I’m supposed to be having with my mom, “OK, Thahabu, what’s wrong with you, how are you going to fix this?” I ask, then I have to struggle with myself to find solutions. I run in this never ending loop because I’m not my mom; I’m not even supposed to know a quarter of these answers. 
My mom has these answers but she’s dead, and since I never met her I’m not even aware that she’s the one I should be talking to. Not only am I crying about whatever screwed-up situation I’m in at the time, I also become frustrated with myself and cry harder because I feel something missing. Perhaps what I’m going through wouldn’t be that serious, if that something was there. It’s like screaming into an empty abyss. I feel helpless and pathetic, then an invisible freight train hits me in the chest and I realize the reason I’m going in circles is because my mom would be the one to answer these questions and help me in these situations. I’m unaware that I miss her because she’s never been around. I have no reference for or expectation of what my mother would do. It’s a very un-fucking-settling feeling. Although I do not know her she has such a huge effect on my life. My ninth grade English teacher described it perfectly, “Even though you never got a chance to meet her, you can still feel her absence,” which encapsulates how I’ve felt my entire life. My mother’s absence is so strong and apparent. It’s in the eyes of the loved ones she left behind, and in those moments when I’m lying in bed screaming for a reason I can’t come up with for five long minutes. 
She’s not here but she’s here, a truth eerily comforting but very painful. Physically painful. Sometimes, I start to feel as though I’ve forgotten something—you know that feeling, when you leave the house and you’re already far away, then dread fills you because you know something important is back at home but you just can’t put your finger on it? My stomach hollows and my chest tightens like a double-knotted shoelace. Am I supposed to be talking to someone or holding something? I’m confused and so is my body. Like me, it’s trying to cope with not having a mom. This is a merciless, lonely feeling. Her absence claws at the back of my neck. I know she’s supposed to be here with me. 
I’ve carried this emptiness since I was a child, moments like these aren’t new to me. Only, it’s gotten worse. There’s a larger, deeper, stronger emptiness. My high school guidance counselor told me that it’s natural for me to miss her, but unlike people who actually have memories of a dead parent, I’ll run into grief instead of it being triggered by remembering something about her. It’ll only get worse as I age because, as I grow into my womanhood, I’ll be met with more and more ask-your-mom experiences. I just have to become comfortable with it. I look like a person I’ve never met, a person I’m supposed to know. She’s missing my becoming a woman, and it’s making me more sad than it used to. 
And I’m scared. What if I’m not turning out the way she’d want me to? My dad tells me she would be proud of me, but with the grades I’m getting right now I’m not too sure. I need her most at this turning point in my life. I feel childish for feeling that way. The absence of someone who was supposed to be an integral part of my growth as a person is just as strong as losing someone I knew personally. It’s my invisible symptom. I’ll forever be encountering odd situations that wouldn’t be so odd if I had a mom. ♦

The perils of existing for more than 12 hours without sleep: A firm belief that I am still a fetus inside my mother’s womb; crying horrendously in front of my friends and strangers; not registering any word spoken in my direction.
I have become good at being lonely, even in front of the people I love and admire most. I keep on thinking about how everything in my life is fleeting—in a single snap they could be gone. But I’m not afraid. I’m just reeling, because it means I have to strive to make every second, minute, hour, day that I get to spend with people worthwhile. Kanye sings, “’Cause when you try hard that’s when you die hard.” That resonates.
I went home spent and tired last night. I dozed off the moment I hit the sack, although I was able to utter the words, “You’ve done well and enough today. Rest, my darling.” I’ve concluded that loneliness fits in my “life timeline;” I will befriend it. Why not, when loneliness makes me kinder, softer, more empathetic? ♦

This week, I made myself a spam account on Instagram, which is something a lot of my friends have been doing. I don’t really use it to post a bunch of excess pictures that don’t make it onto my main Instagram account (because, let’s be real, I post a lot of miscellaneous things on my Instagram anyway), but as a “safe” space for me to talk about what’s going on in my life to people I don’t really know. 
I used to be very cautious about making sure no one I knew in person followed me. Nowadays I don’t care, but one disadvantage of not caring is that I can’t talk about everything I’d like to because I’m scared of hurting people’s feelings. Because I don’t have a “personal” account, I can’t separate the people I know IRL from all my followers. Now that I have this separate, private account, where I can talk about how I’m feeling without worrying who sees, I feel so much better. I’ve been able get some things off of my chest. 
Even so, I still get nervous that someone will expose me for saying something about a friend—by showing it to that friend or something—so I change the names of the people I talk about. When I say “talk about” it seems like a catty thing, but friendships aren’t all going to be 100 percent happy at all times! I really hate conflict with friends—I’ve probably only had two arguments with my best friend—and, even then, whatever happens usually isn’t huge. Often, the issue is something that isn’t big enough to bring up, but is too important to not talk about at all. Still, when I say “talk about” I’m nervous that it makes me sound two-faced or something when really, I’m just trying to not bottle everything so that I don’t blow up on a friend for something stupid like drinking the rest of my water. ♦

Last year, my English teacher said something about how your body knows to hold off being sick or faulty when you’re under a lot of pressure. If you have a huge project that you’ve been doing for two weeks and during that time you’ve been exposed to a cold, your body will be like, “I’m way too busy to deal with this right now,” and it’ll just chill. BUT, once that project is over and you have a three-day weekend or something, that cold will pop up. She was saying that your body doesn’t want to overwhelm you, or that it knows when to fit things in so that you can keep going without too much trouble. 
I don’t think that’s exactly what’s happening to me but now that fall break is here, I’ve slept so so much. All the sleep I’ve been missing over the week just caught up to me and it’s nice to think back to what my teacher said when things like this happen.
It being fall break makes me really excited, because it means winter break is coming really soon, and that will take us into the new year, which actually makes me kinda nervous! The January to June part of the school year passes really quickly, and a lot of my friends are seniors who are graduating soon. Which also means that I’m going to be a senior soon. My mom has been bugging me a lot about college things, and that freaks me out because I have no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life! I don’t even know how college really works. I just wish time would slow down and let me catch up. ♦

For a long time, my mother had us living in a bubble with unrealistic moral standards. The crisis in Syria has forced us out of that bubble, and we are finally facing reality. Throughout the past few years, we’ve had contact with all kinds of people, in shelters and, later on, in our own place, when we’ve embraced friends and relatives in need of help. We’ve witnessed heated fights, bad language, and some violence. Although we understand the effort our mother made in order to protect us, we also now feel that we do not belong to the world in which we live, a world in which everything is very foreign to us. Time, work, and school have also contributed to expanding my horizons, and have provided me with opportunities to learn more about life outside of the bubble in which we grew up. I find myself being gradually immersed in this new world and its standards. This could be my way of rejecting my mother’s authority, or revolting against my old, well-organized world—I do not know.
I have developed a temper. I hurt people’s feelings easily, and I’ve lost the capacity for forgiveness and patience that I used to have. I fight with my siblings and explode with anger, even with my mother, who keeps trying to contain me. I am not even nice to my friends anymore, and I keep losing them, one after another. I feel that hatred has possessed me. I hate everything around me. I’ve become a mean person, even with little kids. Can you believe it?
I do not have respect for anything or anybody, and I’m afraid that I will soon lose my self-respect—that will be the absolute end. I do not enjoy being around people anymore, and I spend most of my time alone. I do so because I am scared that the monster that has grown inside of me over the past few years might come out and hurt those I love. Have I developed this from those I have had contact with, like a kind of disease? Is it bred by the chaos that we are living in? Or is it because of this bloody war? I do not know. 
I am scared. I am really scared. I do not know what’s in store for us. I cannot take our current situation anymore, and I am afraid that the future will be even harsher. I have been silent recently; silence is my new shelter in this reality that I cannot change. Will it be my end as well? ♦

I just got home from a poetry reading called LitOrgy, in my city. It was invigorating to hear from every passionate soul the thirst for freedom, for expression, for catharsis; to hear people, 17 and older, share recollections, well-kept memories, and longings. The whole experience was basically like being god, seeing through everyone’s hearts and souls.
The literary scene in my city, Davao, is thriving, and every year that LitOrgy is celebrated, I see and hear new faces and stories. It’s wonderful to think of what passion can make you do. And these people, the founders of LitOrgy, have been through so much and now they are being offered new people, new stories, bigger event locations, more patrons every single year. It’s amazing what hard work or perseverance, or whatever you’d like to call it, can do.
I remember wishing, “I want to become smart and hardworking” as I listened to a young professor read an excerpt from his short story wherein he raises the question: “What do you wanna be—smart, rich, or beautiful?” I wanna be smart and hardworking! Smart and hardworking, smart and hardworking, smart and hardworking…. I kept this mantra in my mind for as long as I could. My mind asks, Why?
Because I wanna initiate change. I want upheaval, grit-and-bone, and reactions, and gasps. Whatever, I just want to create and love for as long as I live.

All I’ve ever wanted is to be happy. Right now, I’m in a state of being where all I can do is watch myself from the outside, unable to truly control myself. It’s not the lack of control of my inhibitions, it’s more that now that I’m no longer in therapy and have stopped having this outlet I feel stuck in a state of a OK-ness, of fine—but fine isn’t enough. I know that one can’t experience happiness constantly, but I’m fed up. My emotions go up and down like anyone’s but, still, all I want is to be happy, not just this contentedness, this boring, bland part of life. 
The thing is, I don’t know how to achieve happiness. I’ve moved schools, I’ve made new friends, I’ve become more me than I ever have been—as a feminist and queer teenager. I have a wonderful family, amazing friends. What’s left? My brain goes back to that word, relationship, the type of relationship that I am currently craving. Every time I bring this up I’m told that “someone will be just around the corner” and “if you stop looking they will come.” But I’ve been feeling alone and kind of empty for a long time and it’s not as though I’m not looking for a fairy tale or that story book kind of love or romance, but just for once in my life when I love someone could they not love me back. Love me back equally, love me back more, love me in the way I have not been loved before. ♦

I have two or three weeks before the fall semester ends. Word documents and French homework will no longer keep me up past 2 AM, at least until January. I’m excited to go home. I miss being able to spend as much time as I want in the shower while singing along to Beyoncé.
My friends are planning a big New Year’s Eve extravaganza, but I don’t think I’ll have the money for it, we’ll have to see. I don’t really like elaborate plans for parties, because they’re never as fun as you plan them to be.
I’m feeling OK at the moment, but I’m afraid my spinal curve might be growing. I had the same feeling when I was 16, but I was just being paranoid. It’s hard for your spinal curve to grow after the surgery but it’s still possible. I probably think it’s moving because my body is changing. I hope it’s just that and nothing else because I don’t want to go under the knife ever again. It’s one of my biggest fears. ♦

There is a new fly in my room. It bites my face and my neck when I sleep and when I wake up the skin is raised and tinted crimson. It is silent until it is so close to my ear that I think it will graze me and I shudder. 
I’m In Your Mind Fuzz plays. I think about a boy in one of my classes who dresses exactly like Mac DeMarco and has sleepy eyes and rosy cheeks. I don’t have a crush on him but I admire him greatly. Sometimes I can’t believe that he’s real. I like feeling this strongly about other people because it reminds me that I am capable of love. 
Does the fact that I have to remind myself of this inherently denote something negative? I don’t think it should. I’ve been through so much that it comes as a surprise that I am even functioning. 
But I remember human contact with the fuzziness of recollecting a past life. I yearn for a partner. I need a partner, need a partner, need a partner. Doing things in threes makes good things happen. The universe likes things in threes. I’d like to ask why. 
I lean out of the window and blow a kiss to the person I have yet to meet. “I can’t wait until you find me,” I say in my best voice, “or until I find you.” ♦

It’s easy to get caught up in a sort of hivemind when you go to a live soccer game. Say a player far below makes some terrific run, darting and flowing around their opponents like liquid. As they near the goal we, the crowd, rise to our feet as one. If they lose the ball, the collective thud as we sink back into our seats is almost loud enough to echo. If they take it all the way and score, we explode in chants and cheers and songs.
If it’s your favorite player floating in a superb long ball to a teammate, who bats it past the keeper and sinks the first goal of the night into the net—well.
“20, 20, 24 hours to go,” roars the stadium around me, “I wanna be Venegas!”
It’s fun to listen to them sing the name on the back of the jersey I’m wearing, but I’m just a fan. Imagine being a young player just starting to carve out a place for yourself on a team, pulling off some spectacular play and suddenly, quite clearly, hearing it—your own name shouted to the heavens by hundreds of ultras. 
I can’t help but wonder what it feels like to hear them sing your song for the first time. ♦

So, college is awesome. The days are long but there are only three of them, and I just love it. Everyone is just wonderful: Rachel and Tarik have been lovely and they’re who I hang out with each day. It’s also just so nice to like the majority of my class.
On Monday, I went in early to help film something for my enterprise class. A graffiti artist came in and people told him words that they thought of when they heard the word “creative.” He proceeded to spray paint these words onto a big canvas to create a background. Then he wrote “Xtra” in big bright letters. My college has created a programme that aims to create a bunch of extracurricular activities throughout the year. Classes end at five, but there was a launch party from five till seven and I thought I’d be a good little student and go along: It’s more productive than watching Netflix in my room for hours, which is probably what I would have done.
This launch party had music and dance and even a little bit of drama. Kiah, this awesome girl with pink hair, edited together all the footage from the morning session and it was projected onto the board. As much as she denied her editing skills I was impressed with the outcome. I got the bus home with her and we chatted, I found out that she reads Rookie, so at this point I must give her a shoutout. (Heyyyy! You rock on all of the levels! Plus, you are so awesome, much like your old username says.)
I’m having another Halloween party this year. This year I’m inviting college friends, and I’m relying on them to actually come otherwise it’s gonna be relatively dead with just a few of us drinking beer and me doing karaoke on my own. Actually that doesn’t sound too bad either. ♦

My mother has texted me, “Here. Where are you?” 17 times in a row in minute-long intervals for 17 minutes. She is early to pick me up from volunteering. My text notifications are on silent on my phone, which is in my bag, about five yards away from me.
“Here. Where are you?” Unbeknownst to me, another minute has passed and my mother has just copied and sent this text message for the 18th time in a row.
Honestly, Mom, I’m not sure where I am. I know physically, I’m at an elementary school bonding with a fifth grader, but I’m talking about the grander scale here. I’m pretty content with myself, but I know that’s entirely dependent upon how other people view me, so this level of contentment is set to fluctuate almost constantly for the rest of my life. I’m nervous about my future, mainly because I have about 60 or 70 years left to determine its course, and truthfully, I have no idea what I want. I’m also becoming more cognizant of the fact that I won’t ever know.
Since I don’t know what I want, I never know what to do. Usually I follow my heart and act in the moment, but usually, that bites me in the ass. Because I have no gauge on what I want in the future, I can’t even truly assess the consequences and benefits of any decision I make now. That’s not just a little scary, that’s a lot scary. For example, in the future, two minutes from now, you will scream at me for making you wait a whopping 20 minutes in the car because you showed up too early too something I couldn’t leave. But I don’t know that yet, because I haven’t made the decision to check my phone, or the window outside which you sit in your car, fuming. And right now it seems, there’d be no benefit to me doing either. Don’t you see why I’m so confused?
If my indecision, and ignorance to all possible decisions weren’t enough, there is the aspect which is most hard to describe. As of recently, I’ve become someone I don’t think I like. A shallow person. Someone who spends a lot of time looking in the mirror, or trying to find a mirror to look at themselves in, and unfollowing people on Instagram to fix their followers to following ratio. Someone who is genuinely worried about their carbohydrate consumption for reasons none other than their waistline. In theory, there’s nothing wrong with becoming more concerned with my appearance, or social standing, or reputation. But it shouldn’t be everything. I shouldn’t be caring less about producing things to put into the world. I shouldn’t be caring less about absorbing the knowledge of the world. My lack of motivation is frustrating, but I don’t mind its consequences; more time to spend in other areas, I guess. I’m really happy. Boys pay more attention to me, girls too. People say my name when I’m not listening, and that can be scary at times, but ego-boosting and validating at best. I feel popular, and wanted, and “in.” I like where I stand. 
And then I think of myself at age 12 or 13, is the throes of puberty, determined not to ever let the minutiae and bullshit of middle school, or high school, or college, or life dictate who I’d be and who I was to become. I think of the person who made a conscious effort to differentiate themselves from others, to explore their creative interests, to bring something new, and wonderful, and original into the world. That person would be very disappointed in who they’ve become. That person would feel horrible knowing the present them is happy being everything they once stood against. 
Is it bad for me to simply move on, even if it means changing everything I once was?
Mom, I don’t know where I am. But you do. You know exactly where I am. I’m inside the school, talking to a fifth grader about the mean girl in her class so I can get some community service hours. If you simply call me, I’ll hear my phone ringing in my bag, and come out to the car. And then I’ll be sitting right next to you. ♦

Favorite dress? Check. It’s black with thick white stripes running along the sides and collar. It was sold exclusively in the plus-sized section. The white stripes are supposed to add a flattering effect on the body, which they succeed in doing. My twist out was fresh. I’d left my twists in all day, stuffed under a baseball cap, preserving them for the big moment. I’d rubbed olive oil between my hands when carefully untwisting my hair. After minutes of pulling, smoothing down the edges with the tips of my fingers, and padding with the palms of my hands, I’d managed to achieve a certain shine and luster and volume. I was meeting Zadie Smith, and I planned to make my presence known. 
I sat down in the front row, or as close to the front as I could get considering I didn’t pay to have access to legitimate front row seats. Next to me was a poet, conversing with her own kind, about the witty limericks written in the fancy European notebook her mother gifted her for her 17th birthday. Behind me were people whispering about our guest, whose “books I never read, but she’s kind of a big deal, man. People love her!” I admire her, love would be strong. A little too strong a descriptor in the presence of a distinguished writer known for her personal interrogation of the trappings of fame. 
She walked past me before getting on to the stage, in my mind I said hello and we engaged in deep intellectual conversation, but in real life I held my breath. Meeting the people you idealize is always weird, which isn’t her fault in any way, mine only for my own preconceived notion of who she is. Which is more than a byline in the New Yorker, but when they opened their archive that one summer, I fell in love with her essays and short stories. A sight to behold with high cheekbones, freckles, and a headwrap radiating through my YouTube screen. When she approached the podium, she had more of a professorly presence, PowerPoint included. She read “Three Essays About Being A Person” that being the theme that tied each essay to the one before it. The first one, “Flaming June,” about an art poster she bought for her Cambridge dormroom. Her last one, a meditation on Justin Bieber’s seemingly impersonal connection with his fans intertwined with the philosophy of Martin Buber, first time I’d heard of him.
The essay that mattered was titled, “The Bathroom.” It was everything that I needed to hear. Looking directly out into the audience, Zadie Smith told a story of being a lower-middle-class, black girl in England. The audience deemed itself progressive, down for the cause. I attend an institution where KILL ALL RAPISTS flannels flap in the breeze and pocket sized Marx and Lenin philosophy with half chewed off covers are haphazardly stuffed into JanSports adorned with buttons that read “FUCK CAPITALISM.” Bold words from kids whose trust funds are a direct result of generations of brutal capitalism, but who cares anyway? It’s about the cause, man! While the audience giggled at funny parts of an experience so distant from their own, I teared up a bit, sank into my seat and felt so lucky to be there. 
When she talked about her mother devoting her time to decorate their childhood bathroom with tropical plants, it made me think we had the same mother. When my family had its Jeffersons moment and moved to our version of the east side, my mom painstakingly decorated not one, but both of the bathrooms in our apartment. She squeezed the sea motif into everything, overtly in the main bathroom, and covertly in the second half a bath—the seafoam green matching the tiling, matching the towels we couldn’t use, matching the tacky wall decor covered in semi-inspirational quotes.
I smile and “mmm!” through the whole story because there are so many points to which I relate. The part about our parents sacrificing their whole lives and dreams so that their children can flourish. The lower middle class cliché: “Be better than me.” The freedom that is allotted to us as children. My sheer existence is the product of my parents’ unrealized dreams gone by—abandoned when they had another human to look after. They haven’t looked back since, at least not in a way that would exact guilt from their children, that’s now how parents like ours operate. Instead, they take their passion and become our cheerleaders: “You are destined for greatness and I know for a fact you can do anything.” Lower-middle-class children like us, are encouraged to pursue our own paths, no matter how impractical to others. As far as my parents were concerned, I could do anything, no matter how absurd, and if they could lend support, they would. They bought me the keyboard when I was Fakelicia Keys, cornrows and beads and all; the guitar when Corinne Bailey Rae was the center of my universe; and the sewing machine and kit after I was inspired by Project Runway.
After the reading, and answering repetitive questions, Smith began signing books. She went out of her way to engage in conversation with everyone who approached the table. She discussed Penny Dreadful with the girl ahead of me, even though she looked a bit fatigued. She asked me about my earrings, with genuine curiosity. I told her that “The Bathroom” resonated with me, that I was without a major, and that I wrote occasionally but didn’t quite see the value in pursuing a writing degree. Maybe that’s not something to say to any writing professor at NYU, let alone Zadie Smith. Yet, it was how I felt, and how I feel often takes precedence over other things. For better or for worse.
I looked online for “The Bathroom.” I intended to print it out and pour over every word, only I couldn’t find it online. I’d never read a piece that resonated so loudly, which may be the same thing I said about the last piece that resonated with me, but still! There was a part of me on those papers, in those words. I’d rant about the importance of representation in literature, but there’s no need. Let’s just say for a moment, I felt the way all those angst-ridden white dudes feel when they first get their hands on A Catcher in the Rye, be it from an older brother, educator, or colleague. Instead got the story straight from the mouth of the woman herself. 
I need to pour over the words and reevaluate them because I secretly believe it’d help me come to terms with how I feel about my predicament. Being the child of lower middle class parents, there’s no career path I’m banned from pursuing. Zadie can back me up on this. “The world is your oyster” is a corny quote, but also a way for my parents to empower me to seek to expand my worldview and make the most of my experience. Some days I see it that way, other days it means I have to follow my dreams against all the odds, suck the world dry, and chase down my ambitions by any means necessary. 
Despite their pleas for me to forge my own path, I take with me the unrealized dreams of my parents. To throw caution to the wind and continue without acknowledging the sacrifices made feels wrong. Sacrifices that range from shelving their aspirations of being a social worker to stepping on sewing needles I’d spilled throughout the apartment in a creative frenzy. Or watch the keyboard they’d spent hard-earned money on collect dust, another “dream” unfulfilled. Not an ounce of contempt, but rather a roll with the punches approach, laughs, and being comfortable with a life where their kids are the center. Having an upbringing such as mine, such as Zadie’s, with immense support from my loved ones, you’d think I’d take a more bohemian approach to life: Take on the clichés of a writer, keep a Moleskine in my pocket, keep a watchful eye on potential characters and interesting quotes from my peers. Dramatic, tortured, constantly in pursuit of new experiences to communicate through prose. Why don’t I think I fit the criteria? Why is writing not a noble enough profession? Why did I tell Zadie Smith I didn’t think it was worth getting a degree in? 
I do know it has something to do with my growing up during a time where entrepreneurship is en vogue. My parents telling me money isn’t synonymous with success meant nothing to me when Mark Zuckerberg was a 23-year-old billionaire. A kind of accessible figure from the same county as I, in fact in a town about 15 minutes away. Being told that nothing is out of reach while concurrently watching people reach new heights—it motivates you. It moves you to want to go above and beyond. To buy Daddy that rolex, and give Mommy an unlimited budget to decorate an infinite number of bathrooms; lofty yet not completely unachievable goals. 
And so, I often ask myself, do I want to write the profiles of important people or be the subject of the profile? I’d much prefer the latter. That alone informs my decisions and outlook. Everything else isn’t clear to me; I’m reconciling my own beliefs little by little. I’m also 18, an excuse I fall back on when necessary and now is as a good a time as any! I don’t have it all worked out. Who has it all worked out? I might just will myself into being a prolific writer, or CEO, or both? After all, “the world is my oyster,” and seeing as my parents want me to “be better than them” I can move in either direction, their “lower middle class clichés” and the literature of Zadie Smith to guide me along.

We’re days out from surgery and tensions are already high. How are we going to handle my absences from school? Will I be able to get around on crutches without breaking, well, something else? What if the anesthesia makes me nauseous? I have to keep eating to start the healing process, right? What if…
It’s all been a little much.
If there’s one good thing that this surgery will bring—right from the start—it is a few days to let things settle. I don’t care how much I’ll need to catch up on once I actually go back to school. Right now I just need quiet: I’m sick of all this noise in my head. There’s too much to do and not enough of me to go around. ♦

My days repeat themselves in a circular motion—they start and end at the same point. I have returned to my studies. I go to classes in the morning, where I spend time with my friends. But things get worse every year, and conversing with friends has become less and less fun. All the same, those sad conversations help me feel better, especially when I hear about their issues and problems. After listening to them, I realize how small my problems are.
I have great relationships with my teachers; they are more friends than they are teachers. The whole environment is sad, though—male students intentionally fail their first-year exams in order to maximize the length of their stay at school. They worry that if they graduate, they will have to serve in the military. I completely understand: Joining the military right now means death. They prefer to jeopardize their future over joining the army. But how sad, how disturbing.
Going back to school will keep me busy, and distract me from all the problems that surround me, I hope. Since my classes are in the morning, I will work for only five hours in the evening. This will mean less money, but it will still be enough to cover my daily expenses and keep me from asking my mother for money.
Getting to and from school and work is a big problem. This trip that used to take 15 minutes now takes around three hours. Believe me, sometimes I get tired of waiting for the bus, so I decide to walk home. This takes forever, and when I get home, I am usually too tired to talk to anybody or even to eat.
One thing bothers me. My aunt managed to get out of Ghouta a few days ago. She had no place to stay, and came to live here with her four kids, of whom the eldest is 10. This forced us to change our lives and our routines, but, above all, our home has become extremely noisy, and I cannot find time for myself anymore or spend time with my mother. The presence of my aunt and her family has placed extra pressure on my family, but there is no way for us to ask them to leave. Despite all the pressure, we love her and her family, and we would help her no matter what. She has no one else in the big city of Damascus. We are her only hope. I have to admit that sometimes I feel conflicted. As much as I want to help her, I feel annoyed and uncomfortable in my own house.
It looks like escaping has become our new destiny—we want to escape from home, from our responsibilities and from the whole country. What’s left? Maybe I will escape life altogether. The situation keeps deteriorating. I try not to let this crisis affect everything I do, but I always fail in this effort. The crisis is stronger than me. It actually controls my life. 
My mother is the only person who keeps amazing me. She still believes that she can make something of us. Despite all the pressure, she is still hopeful. ♦

Some of my friends from Queer Straight Alliance did our peer education presentations in the freshman classes at my school. Our QSA has been doing this for a few years and what we do is cover basic info about the LGBTQ+ community and go over safety at school. This year, I did presentations all day during each period. I thought I would be nervous but everything was fine. Last year, when I did them I didn’t talk and I would sway nervously. This year when I messed up, it didn’t feel like the end of the world and it was easy to laugh it off. I felt more relaxed partly because my friends were around, but I also did a full presentation by myself that went really well. I think it’s true that my self confidence has improved a lot. A year ago, I cared so much about what other people thought of me that it got in the way of what I could actually do. I still care, but I know that what I think about myself and what the people close to me think is way more important. It means a lot to me that I was able to do that presentation alone; that was a big step. Now I know I’m capable of being on my own. ♦

Is it bad to repeat a Halloween costume you wore two years ago? I’m thinking about going home this week to look for my Morticia Addams costume so I can be her again. Or maybe I’ll just be a zombie school girl since I’ve already got the skirt. Anyway, barely anyone got to see me as Morticia Addams that year because I wasted the night with a certain boy who called me his girlfriend but in reality I barely liked him and it lasted a month before we ended things (he was lowkey abusive so it’s fine).
I find it funny that around this time two years ago I decided to be someone’s girlfriend. I never thought I’d have a “relationship” in high school. My older sister said “you’re supposed to date someone just to date them at your age.” I disagreed then and I disagree with that now. I sure as hell don’t believe every relationship is supposed to lead to marriage however, I want to have deep, warm feelings for the person. I want to feel a connection, and if turns out we’re not meant for each other at least we had that effect on each other at one point, right? Well the “boyfriend” I had two years ago—for now we’ll call him Yellow Paint—did not have that effect on me at all. 
I should’ve gone running when we were only in the talking stage. He explained that part of the reason he was ecstatic about seeing me is because it was nice to finally date a “healthy girl” because he’s used to dating “mentally disturbed white girls.” He was narcissistic, and described in great detail how that made him suffer. Hurting people’s feelings and fracturing friendships was common for him, he couldn’t help it: He was a natural jerk. Even though he warned me about these glaring flaws, he seemed sweet and funny enough for my tastes. I didn’t get a chance to to actually experience the pain he causes those who cross his path until it was too late. That’s one of the biggest dangers of rushing into relationship: You don’t get to watch your potential partner being their complete selves; you jump into commitment and have to wait for a soul-crushing bomb, that you didn’t even know existed, to explode.
I started paying attention to how he spoke to me, especially whenever I confided in him. I opened up about feeling freakish and isolated because I’ve never met another girl who has such a severe scoliosis curve, or girls with single dads. His tone sounded like what stubbing your own toe feels like. “Well, you know you’re not the only one who goes through that right?” He even laughed when I told him that sometimes I feel guilty about my mother’s death. What killed me is that when he would complain to me about situations that irked him—such as not having the iPhone he wanted, or his mom not giving him money—I was supposed to be the most sympathetic girl in the world. When I told him it wasn’t that serious he’d get angry. 
It was during those conversations that I understood what he really meant when he said he only goes for “mentally disturbed girls.” Not only was his description ableist but it was flat out wrong. What he meant is that he only likes girls who don’t have a strong sense of self, girls whose parents don’t pay much attention to them, who don’t recognize when someone is manipulating them, and trying to make them feel like they’re nothing without him. He was not mature at all: He didn’t have a job and he depended on his mom and grandma for everything. Talking down to his girlfriends was the only time he felt powerful and more mature than someone else. 
I broke up with him, but not before doing something equally narcissistic and “conniving woman” esque. He would always talk about the poems he wrote for me. The weekend before I planned the breakup with him I asked him to send me one of those poems, partly so I could see if he really liked me more than I liked him, if there was a chance I could change him into a better person. (That’s never possible, you can’t turn an asshole into a better person through a relationship, don’t try it.) But it was mostly to feel like I had manipulated him into doing something for me. He got excited, said he wanted to write me a brand new poem and that he would email it to me. It was more of a lengthy creative letter than a poem but it was super cheesy in a kind of endearing for-someone-who-I-now-realize-is-abusive way. 
I kept the poem in my Google Docs and broke up with him that Tuesday. He was sad for a while. Looking back on it now, I feel bad for stooping to his level, but whatever, mistakes are made at 17, right? He wanted me to be this helpless girl so that he could passive aggressively belittle me. The problem is, I wasn’t that girl and it bothers me that he exploits vulnerable people in order to boost his own ego. 
Some good came out of the situation though. I became best friends with the people I met through him, and even though making him write me a poem before I broke up with him was really mean, it still felt good to hurt him, even if it’s nothing close to how he treats other women. That year was hard, and as much as I hated him, I would always read that poem when I was feeling down, to laugh but also be able to say this stupid kid wrote this over-the-top, sloppy love letter to me. I feel like Morticia Addams would’ve done the same. ♦

I am in my shower—a solitary box in my bathroom—when my mother’s cerulean velvet robe hanging on the door morphs into Blackie from One-Eyed Jack’s. Her sharp elegance contrasts my nudity and I am unmoving, staring at her through the opaque shower door. I stare at the plushness of her lips as she speaks:
“Do you belong to the White Lodge or the Black Lodge?”
“Uhhhhh, uhhhhh, um,” I can’t form words. We are not on my terms; the two of us are existing in her time and space. Everything looks the same but everything is different. 
She smiles. “Decide soon. You know how to find me.” And with that, Blackie is gone. She has become my mother’s dressing gown again. 
I continue to shower when I can feel myself once again. Oh no, I think. Oh no.

A Dweller on the Threshold is: “the sum total of all the personality characteristics which have remained unconquered and unsubtle, and which must be finally overcome before initiation can be taken. Each life sees some progress made; some personality defects straightened out, and some real advance effected. But the unconquered residue, and the ancient liabilities are numerous, and excessively potent, and—when the soul contact’s adequately established—there eventuates a life wherein the highly developed and powerful personality becomes, in itself, the Dweller on the Threshold. Then the Angel of the Presence and the Dweller stand face to face, and something must then be done.” The premise is a huge part of Twin Peaks and the Black and White Lodges. 
It is said that controlling this Dweller allows one to enter the arena of dark forces and come out unscathed. However, if this malevolent place is entered without the proper grasp on the Dweller, destruction will ensue. 
I do not know the specifics of my Dweller but I feel its presence every day like an unborn twin. I can feel myself getting closer to facing it and I do not know how to prepare. The desire to know oneself always bears the risk of self-consumption. 
The darkness approaches with the subtlety of a preying lion and I scream endlessly. No one hears but me. The echo is enough to shatter my skin. ♦

This past week I got my report card and I got, probably, my highest GPA since I started getting a GPA. This year my classes seem a lot easier and I wonder if it’s a coincidence because junior year is the most important year for college applications. 
Even though my grades were really good, I got a C in HP English. And yeah, it’s weighted as a B in my GPA but that’s the class I work the hardest in. I’ve also never gotten a C in English. If anything, English has been my best class all these years; I could always fall back on an A or a B there. It’s really frustrating to think about all the nights wen I’ve gotten four hours sleep because I’ve been doing English work. It doesn’t totally help either that I have another essay that’s worth even more than the last one: 450 points. I used a lot of time in which I could have been developing it on preparing my Queer Straight Alliance presentations last week. 
My teacher has also been putting a lot of pressure on me to do well. I had a panic attack on Thursday just thinking about all the work I have to do. I usually pull it off but I’m worried because I keep not setting aside the time to actually do anything. I really, really need this to be a good essay, for my grades, my teacher, and for me. ♦

We’ve still got over two months of this year left, but I’m already looking back on 2015 in wonder and love. During the past year, I believe that I’ve changed and grown as a person more than any other time in my life thus far. I have faced fears, made friends, discovered a new home, and accepted myself, all in the last 10 months. 
At the beginning of the year, I was a girl who hated herself, someone who constantly thought the only way out would be through suicide, someone who calmed herself by carving in to her skin. I barely left the house and cried myself to sleep every night. I didn’t think I would ever get out of the black hole I was in. But, with the help of a multitude of things and people, I have come out the other side. Of course the black dog that is depression is still there, and the anxiety will always be a part of me, but those things are no longer screaming at me to notice them. 
What helped me the most was therapy, something I was terrified to start. It took me months to finally be able to open up to my therapist Georgia. On top of that I started taking antidepressants. Both of these things helped improve my depression and anxiety immensely. My confidence has grown, and I have been able to do many things that I couldn’t have a year ago, such as going to GirlCon and starting a new college—both experiences that have allowed me to meet people and find new friends. It’s also meeting these new people that has helped me become a better person, a better feminist, and the out queer woman I am today. ♦

Despite all the hardships of life, and despite all the closed doors, there are some little windows through which light always reaches us. My college is a source of light in my life. It is where I meet people and experience life. Although I hear tragic stories every day, college is the place that helps me forget my issues and concerns. But the craziness of our times even reaches the academy. Two days ago, security officers raided our college and chased students, attempting to arrest them. Everyone was so scared, and students ran like little mice. I do not mean to demean my friends by using that analogy; it just felt like, in that moment, they were not human beings with the right to respect. The security officers were looking for particular names, but as usual they instilled terror in the whole place.
Many of my friends want to leave the country, but traveling is very expensive and everyone has spent all of their savings in the last few years. Because of our forced migration, women greatly outnumber men in Syria. I understand why everyone is trying to leave. Life here is like a frightening wilderness—there is no stability and no security—so we cannot thrive or live fully. 
Occasionally I wonder why I am still attached to my studies. Maybe because it was my choice to study prosthetics. Or maybe because I hope that one day I might be able to help those who have lost their limbs and their hope. Maybe it’s hard for you to understand what I mean, if you come from a very different place. But where I live, when someone loses a limb, she becomes disabled and dependent, while in other parts of the world, I hear that people who have lost limbs live full lives—you even have competitive sporting leagues.
You know, despite all the humiliation and deprivation that I have faced in my city, I still truly love it. I love its people. Maybe because I was raised as a forgiving person, forgiveness is something the conflict couldn’t take away from me. I used to think that forgiveness was a sign of weakness, but I now realize that it’s a source of strength. That said, I admit that there are some people whom I hate, like the owner of our building, who keeps increasing the rent whenever he can, even though he knows how bad our situation is.
They are doing renovations at work, so my manager asked me to take two months off. While it’s good that I can commit all of my time to my studies, time off decreases my income, which makes life harder for me since I have to pay for my own education and transportation expenses. I think I’ll have to look for a part-time job during these two months.
One thing that stresses me out is that my friends were able to develop themselves this summer. They enrolled in language and computer classes, while all I did was struggle to generate income. I have many desires, but I cannot pursue any of them. “I would like” and “I want” are expressions I don’t use anymore, but I do want so many things. Will a day come when I live with dignity? ♦

Modesty. Why am I so obsessed with it?
I know patriarchy has a lot do with it: Telling women never to speak of themselves and all. And I know patriarchy has a lot to do with the Puritanical roots of American society.
Maybe I should be living in some early American Puritanical society then, where modesty is forced upon citizens with threats of jail time and public shaming. It’s not non-gray clothing that bothers me, I just hate when people flatter themselves. I wish every person had a level of humility just shy of internalized self-hatred. The world would be a better place.
Paired with my obsession with modesty, is my sense of normality. This weekend I saw The Martian, a film in which Hollywood hunk Matt Damon aka fictional astronaut Mark Watney ends up trapped on Mars for a few hundred “sol.” Damon/Watney’s situation is incredible because of how high the stakes are, and because of how significant his predicament is to himself, NASA, and, well, the entire human race. When his crew leaves him on Mars thinking he’s dead, he becomes the first person to ever exist on another planet alone. When he miraculously begins growing crops in one of his habitation chambers, he becomes the first person to colonize space. When he breaks an international treaty while following maritime law, he somehow becomes a pirate, too. But aside from snippy quips made to his video diary, his situation never seems to really resonate with or affect him. That’s not faulty filmmaking, it’s human nature. It’s my own nature.
Obviously, I’m not stuck on Mars. I’m not colonizing it, or practicing piracy to escape from it, either. But, I deeply underestimate, and in some situations, outright ignore, the importance and impact of various happenings in my life. I’m a teenage girl with an amazing role at Rookie, who never feels the need to tell anyone about it, because it all seems very normal to me. Rookie has been a personal bible to me since a very young age, and I’d always dreamed of becoming a contributor. When I became one, I was stunned for a bit, but soon those feelings were replaced by fears I’d drive my editor insane with my increasingly late submissions, or that certain boys would read certain pieces concerning them. 
It wasn’t until this week, when I went to a release party for the fourth and final Yearbook, where I was ogled by my friend (who is equally if not more established) for being allowed to walk up to the contributors’ section, and saw my own written works printed on page 287, with my own printed name written above, seeing Tavi Gevinson read, feet away from me, that I realized, Hey, this is a big deal. I’m a part of something important. In this sense, my not wanting to tell people about my role at Rookie is just as much about not wanting to seem boastful as it is about forgetting how lucky and grateful I am.
Life’s been coming at me fast lately. I am a teenage girl experiencing new and important things every day. But I rarely open up to my friends, or my mom about how I’m feeling or what’s going on in my life. I know I should. The things I will experience and decisions I will make in the coming years are once in a lifetime opportunities, firsts which can never be first-ed again. It just seems that all of these experiences and opportunities are so normal, so unworthy of thought, and feeling, and energy. I keep everything inside because I don’t want to talk about myself, and because I don’t want to make things a bigger deal than they need to be.
The advancement of the human race is not dependent upon my decisions, but personally, I’m on my own Mars. I have to make sense of it all. I have to talk about it more. I have to praise myself more. ♦

I am in the process of watching friends shed their organic, sophomore skin and work themselves into calloused juniors. I, too, am a junior, but I think I somehow managed to get left behind on the planet “lol, just doin’ me.” Like in Martian, except I am a metion. I thought that acting as landfill for others’ complaints about grades and colleges and class ranks would be the worst of it, but then I wouldn’t be writing this. However much it hurts to hear about how having a 4.0 “is sucky” (I’m getting there), or how being ranked number 20-whatever is “not good enough” (try 20 times 10), it is so much more shocking to watch these people sell out. 
What really epitomizes this transformation is my friend, Q, creating a “music for cancer” club. A lot of my friends have been making clubs around campus so that they can tell a future piece of paper how this-or-that they are, even though the “club” is complete bull shark and does nothing at all—a fact practically verified by the presidents themselves. It’s annoying on the account that it dilutes the club scene, but that’s whatevs. It was finding out that Q was creating a college-application-club with a “let’s fight cancer!” facade, that made the general prick of The Thumbtack of Annoyance travel deeper into my skin and psyche. 
I was barely cognizant of what has happening around me when my mom got sick, fought, and recovered. I only remember receiving lots of presents and being told again and again that “it” wasn’t my fault. Immersed in the white world of hospitals, I was clued in enough to know that I was a lucky kid to still have my mom—luckier than some of the others.
Currently, I go back and forth between telling myself I am being sensitive, and fueling the anger I have over the fact that my own good friend would start a club pretending to help cancer patients so that they could look like a good person for UC Whatever. ♦
