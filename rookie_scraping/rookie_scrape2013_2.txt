Honestly, if my experience were a living being and these beaming-white computer-screen diary pages were the many parts of a marble statue of that being, the living being would be really pissed at me, the model for its likeness. The actual being, the sum of experience, is always warping and growing and changing, so it would know it could not be properly memorialized in a single unmoving pose. It would still be angry and stuff, because even if I try to get down just one part, it’s not right. I write about the wrong thing or write about the wrong part of a thing or write about everything but totally miss the point or can’t find good words for it. Writing and speaking to people make me feel like my lungs are stiffening. It’s exhausting. ♦

I have never felt more uninspired in my life. I don’t look around and think, Wow, if you really think about it, everything is beautiful. I get distracted, I miss deadlines, I stay in bed. I don’t write stories anymore and I don’t go on dates with myself alone in the woods or at a coffee shop.
Everything feels foggy, like the morning after a night of getting high. I haven’t known that feeling for real in a very long time, but it feels like I’m always so groggy and out of my mind that I’d never know the difference.
Sometimes I write bad poetry, show up late for appointments, and wear all gray or my most faded old flannel shirts. Things were getting better for me for a while, but now I’m back to listening to exclusively OK Computer and I know I’m not OK.
I pace around my room for hours and rock in the corner in a little ball, disappearing into the line where the two walls meet. I will fit inside that line, make myself invisible. I will become the corner.
I don’t read books, I don’t write stories. I don’t watch TV or talk to my friends, the number of which is steadily decreasing. I don’t go to school or have an outside job, I don’t play music or listen to much. I watch analog clocks and twist the cord on my headphones to distort the sound.
I don’t reply to texts, and sometimes I cry without frowning. Tears will just sort of form and fall without a sound or a trace other than wetness on my cheeks. ♦

I’m in the cafeteria with Chloe and I can feel the room has a warmth that was not there before Thanksgiving break. When we first met talk was easy, interesting, and limitless, then it was more difficult, and now it’s better. It’s familiar and pleasant. Sometimes we laugh without much restraint. And I project this near-euphoric familiarity into the atmosphere of the room: It is like the dining hall is blushing: happy, excited, and a little shy.
Almost as soon as I’m conscious of this new happy feeling, I am self-conscious. Maybe it’s temporary, and maybe she’s only laughing because I am, but I think I detect a real desire to hang out when she says that she wishes she had smoked her weed with me instead of another person. There is ease in our conversation, and what I suspect is mutual enjoyment.
I listened to an interview Julie Klausner did with the writer Gaylord Fields. At one point he told her that since he’s black and most of what’s on TV is white people doing white people things, he felt like a cultural anthropologist whenever he watched it. He didn’t look to movies and books for reflections of his own experiences, but to examine the customs of a different culture. I’ve felt a similar relationship to my own life. When I’m with Chloe and I affectionately notice one of her mannerisms or I laugh at something we’re talking about, and especially when I hang out in a group and with new people, I feel like I’m collecting data. But it’s not like I’m reading about or watching a documentary on some unfamiliar culture—whereas I used to only be able to observe human behavior from a critical distance, I now feel immersed, like with enough time here I could actually become part of this foreign civilization. I feel an increasing familiarity with my classmates, my tenuous ties to them strengthening each day. I still can’t imaging having a fully formed social life, but I see a hazy form in the distance. I can’t make out the shape of it, but it’s there. And things are gaining momentum. I’ve been enjoying my hanging-out times with Chloe more and more.
I feel like I’m finally ready to be with people. Or like I could be ready. Or like just being with them means I’ve been ready for a little while. I think weed is a revelation. Chloe and I hung out with some older girls in their room, and it was like a layer of noise and static had cleared away. My thoughts felt logical and clear, talking didn’t hurt, and my stomach felt OK after it all. 
These are all good feelings and all good things. ♦

Everything feels very intimate. It has for a while. Things that used to feel safely distant are drawing closer, their orbits tightening around me and picking up speed as though my gravitational pull has gotten stronger, and I cannot stop this even if I wanted to. 
Would I want to stop it? My soul is like a Jell-O ring—prod it and it will jiggle; cut into it and it may fall apart, become a pile of quivering little lumps. I don’t want to avoid experience, I want to chase it. I’ve gone back to doing what I used to do when I was very young and very distressed: staring out windows until I feel like part of what George Eliot calls “that involuntary palpitating life,” like part of the cosmos or something. I used to imagine that I was a specific tree or plant—I would tell myself, I am that tree, and clear my mind of everything except photosynthesis and the movement of water up the trunk and the space the tree occupied. Now, I pay close attention to my breathing and feel like I am other people. 
I used to not want to read Walt Whitman; I felt like everything he talked about was something I already knew and felt. Now I see how much clearer he is in describing many of my own beliefs and habits (especially in “Song of Myself” and “I Sing the Body Electric”), and how his descriptions help clarify my own thoughts and feelings. Like Whitman, “I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother’s breast with the little child, / Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with the wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, count.” I loosen myself from my own consciousness and feel like I’m moving outside of myself and becoming one with every life force. I think it feels something like being in love or being mesmerized or like taking a really good breath. It helps me love the world more, and being part of it, myself, too. 
I associate this meditative practice with my much-younger self, but it’s still where I go to see myself for who and what I am, to observe my own worth. It is how I escape from self-loathing and and how I will become a better listener and interact with people better. I am starting to carry this feeling around with me, and it makes everything feel so very close. Sometimes this proximity to everything feels transcendent, as it is in Whitman; sometimes it’s more like when Courtney Love sings, in “Softer, Softest”:
I’ve got a blister from
Touching everything I see
The abyss opens up
It steals everything from me
Or like Arthur Rimbaud’s boat, which, after fully experiencing all there is to experience, desires oblivion. The last two feelings are scary, and the fear of feeling them is why I usually avoid experiencing very much. But for now, I feel this almost druggy closeness to the world immediately around me strongly. It distracts me from schoolwork, but it helps me be present when I’m with others, to think of myself less. 
Every look, every word, every adjustment of someone’s posture feels like a physical touch. When someone talks to me, I feel as if their hands are fumblingly touching my face like the arms of a squid moving over a rock, gently slapping and sliding all over the surface. It is eerie and extremely intimate.
I went out with some girls from my dorm one night a month or so ago. When the waitress poured me a water, I was genuinely moved. I blushed and thanked her emphatically in a voice that was slightly choked up. The girl sitting across from me noticed my reaction and looked confused. I tried to explain that it had felt like such an intimate gesture, because water is so essential and primal—it was not unlike having someone wash your hair or hand-feed you—and that I was embarrassed because this woman was a total stranger. I don’t think this explanation helped.
My brother and I used to get on our hands and knees, drape our parents’ comforter over ourselves, and crawl about the house together, chanting, “Amoeba, amoeba, amoeba,” occasionally accidentally picking up and dragging an errant shoe or getting caught on the edge of a carpet. When we grew too frustrated with the difficulty of coordinating our movements and/or the extreme heat under the blanket, the game was over. Right now it feels like every person I talk to is trying to play amoeba with me. It’s nice so far, if a little uncomfortable. I hope that when it gets too hot or too difficult, I will not give up, that I will be resilient enough to maintain contact. ♦

The weather is cold and pretty, making me want to be outdoors a lot, all the time. But more than that, I want to get outside of myself. The upper half of an entire wall of my dormroom is a window, and I usually position myself so that I can look outside just by lifting my eyes any time I read or use my computer. When I gaze at the outside world, my skin feels less solid, more permeable—like I could easily escape through it. 
As the week progressed I felt less and less contained, not just because of all the staring out the window. People may see me as a body—and I usually feel like a body—but looking outside makes me feel like I’m also a part of what I see. Like the energy in me is everywhere I look.
On Monday, a graduate student in one of my classes startled me as I was packing up by turning to me and speaking: “Me and a few others like to get coffee after class. Would you like to go with us?” I freaked out. I had a French class after that I was going to skip anyway, but the surprise of the offer was enough to make me panic. I stuttered and said uh a lot, and apologized for what seemed like an infinite amount of time before finally asserting that YES I WOULD LIKE TO GO. I very much wanted to go with her and the French graduate student who was going with her because they’re crazy smart and interesting, and I hoped I didn’t mess it up by being initially hesitant. Talking about it now I can still feel that moment of anxiety like it’s happening in real time.
After coffee, I hung out with a girl from my French class I’ve been talking to. We started by having lunch, then talked for a while, then extended our hangout into studying together. After she leaves, I feel like my mind has been freed of something warm and heavy, though in reality it’s just received a lot. I feel crazy energy in my fingers—like I could extend them into the universe if I wanted to. I forgot that talking to people could make me this way. It was so distracting I couldn’t focus on schoolwork until later that night.
I continued to talk with others throughout the week. How was I able to study so much in high school when I was interacting with people all day? By Saturday morning I was more like the version of myself that is slightly more fun to be around—it’s one of the times my brother would say my personality is “on.”
On Saturday night Chloe and I went to a fetish-themed party in a dorm across campus. I didn’t have any spectacular clothing, so I spent tons of time putting on weird makeup—purple and pink eye shadow, thick winged eyeliner, black lipstick, and double rows of false eyelashes. I looked tame-ish, partially because my outfit was just a wool plaid skirt with a black top, tights, and heels, but I felt proud that I didn’t look internet-trendy, and that it felt like my outfit was communicating a bit of the energy I was feeling. I felt like Nelson Sullivan as Amnesia when she says, “I feel so pretty that I feel like I must have always looked this way.” This was going to be the first college party where we would have fun. Maybe we would even meet people we could get along with. Everyone we’d been meeting thus far seemed more conservative than us.
An hour later, I’m standing in line alone while Chloe tries to talk our way into the party, which is at capacity when we arrive. From outside I can hear that the music selection is good, and I catch glimpses through the windows of people inside dancing, not standing around bored like they usually do at parties. The line is moving, but depressingly slowly. Finally Chloe returns, shaking her head no. The security guard informs us that with 40 minutes of official partying hours left, we probably won’t get to the front of the line in time.
We break out of the line. I scream into the air and start running toward our dorm. I look bonkers, but there aren’t many people out. The screaming turns into one long ugghhhh, my running becomes jokily bratty stomping. Chloe catches up to me and groans.
Later, over glasses of chocolate milk, we whine about how good we look. I whine about how badly I wanted —want—to dance tonight. I guess I talked to some cool people in line, but I want to dance around people who also feel this gorgeous energy. ♦

At the beginning of the week my brain felt like this heated aquarium filled with fat, sluggish tropical fish. Now it’s Wednesday and all the water is gone. It is an empty aquarium brain.
I’m about to start reading Middlemarch for class. I have all afternoon and all night to read 122 pages: 12–14 hours if I need that long. When I was younger I could read a 500-page novel in a night. 
I open the book. I know it is dense and difficult and has many characters and story lines. Even though I’ve read and enjoyed longer, equally difficult books in the past, I am afraid I won’t understand this one. I know I won’t.
It takes me 12 hours to read 78 pages. Reading requires an exhausting amount of concentration; I spend six minutes on a single page, reading slowly, getting to the bottom and realizing I have no idea what I just read, and then rereading it at an even slower pace. I am drawn in by Dorothea and Dr. Causabon’s subplot, but reading is exhausting me and stressing me out so much that I have to take frequent breaks, during which I find myself unable to move or think complete thoughts. The only thing that momentarily lifts my paralysis was having to go to the bathroom. 
Thursday I have all afternoon to read “Song of Myself.” I try to read the first line but can’t. I feel everyone I’ve ever met reading my mind and seeing that I’m not up to this task. It makes me uneasy that they can so clearly see something that my ego has so far prevented me from acknowledging. I just stare at things and lie down. I’m lazy. And I’m hardly literate. I freak out. Others have already seen me, figured me out, and moved on. I’m the one having trouble doing the same.
Friday morning I feel worse. Friday afternoon, at my brother’s suggestion, and even though nothing’s too serious, I call counseling and get an appointment to see a tall, thin middle-aged woman in a long floral skirts and a fleece vest. She speaks in a gentle voice, and is nice to talk to even though, based on the two conversations I’ve had with her so far, I don’t think she completely understands. 
In my mind she does not exist anywhere but in that office, at 10 AM on Tuesday, where she sits frozen until I arrive for my appointment. ♦

I’m done spending all of my time worrying about school work or spending inordinate amounts of time on school work and rarely letting myself do anything else, even on weekends.
I’m done going to boring college parties (I went to maybe five this semester, but I still get to be SO OVER them). I’m done going to social events where I know I will feel disconnected and far away and then leave halfway through. But I’m also done making excuses for not working harder to make friends. I’m ready to give up giving up.
I’m done with, or at least fed up with, my fear of being known by other people. There’s a girl in one of my classes I hung out with twice, but during every gap in our conversations I was so visibly nervous that she had to tell me to calm down, then when she said she liked Robert Frost I said I didn’t like him because my high school was always pushing “Fire and Ice” and “The Road Not Taken” on us—but what kind of idiot doesn’t like something just because they studied it in school? Those poems were always boring to me. Why didn’t I say that and ask what his interesting stuff was? Remembering how weird and thoughtless I was around her makes me cringe, and I don’t want her to even see me again.
I need to be done with so much. ♦
Katherine
I’m lying supine on my bed with my knees bent, my feet tucked under my butt. My eyes are closed and my hands are on my belly. My body feels itself breathe. My hands feel the tension in my stomach as I breathe in and feel it shrink and subside as I breathe out. And I’m in a reverie. I have no sense of time, and words are not important—it’s that feeling you get when you’ve just seen something breathtakingly beautiful and cannot look away, like you’re not in your body, you’re just pure consciousness observing this thing. But in this case that thing was me. I was observing myself like an outside organism, watching it breathe. I stayed this way for a long time, transfixed by the new perspective.
It is good to avoid feeling prolonged contempt for myself. When I was like 13 I went to a sleepover and had Cheetos and M&M’s on my ice cream after pizza for dinner and then woke up after watching movies all night and had waffles with multiple candy toppings. The way my body felt that morning is the way my mind feels when I’ve been hating myself. The way it feels when I’m lying in bed watching myself breathe is the opposite. It feels like my body knows its essential value. I can forget for a moment about the contempt I have for my behavior and my intellect and focus on this feeling that is full and good, that is content as it is. And it belongs to me. ♦

I hear bells ringing from the church down the street and I feel reality vibrate away with them. I know that the surprise day off from class is no more or less real than any other day, but it slips from me like a dream even as I am living it. 
A freshman and I set out into what would be woods except for the fact that they don’t extend very far. They’re like a kiddie version of the big scary woods, set near the edge of our campus, so civilians from town go there to hike the trail—couples and dogs and gorgeous, gorgeous old women with long gray hair and artisanal barrettes. There’s a pond that runs into a creek and a place where there’s slightly more water and people swim. There are rocks and trees and prayer flags and the occasional tent.
We get to the swimming area, glance at a sign that tells us that the water is not safe to swim in half the time, take off our clothes, and wade in in our underwear. The deeper we get the colder the water feels, and the more we gasp in pain and stretch our bodies upwards—then we get used to it and begin to swim in circles. We talk and slowly lose our dexterity as our blood chills.
We eventually move our things to the other side of the creek—slowly because our frozen hands are like paws and our legs don’t respond very quickly—and walk through high grass to arrive at a dirt track surrounding a field of wheat. The sun and heat are more profound here. They are just what they are. We walk the track then run back to stand at the side of a trail in a few feet of light—thawing statues baffling runners.
I feel guilty every time I listen to a song or spend too long in the shower or walk around outside for five minutes, because I know I have work to catch up on—and beyond that, general life intelligence to catch up on. But today we spend all day doing nothing and end it at a restaurant with a stupid name and a stupid font on the menus and eat our entire plate of enchiladas and nonsense. I return to my dorm, glance at my assignments, and go to sleep. I felt grateful. The day feels like a little smooch on the top of my head, muffled by hair. ♦

This numbness has come over me. I can’t feel much of anything. Food doesn’t taste as good, pain doesn’t hurt as much, I don’t get as hungry or thirsty or tired.
I feel numb when I’m in school (as opposed to the normal misery).
I felt numb when I slapped some douchebag in the face.
I felt numb when people told me that they loved me.
I felt numb trying to think of something to write. I’m uninspired.
I feel mentally exhausted, like I want to go to sleep, but my body isn’t tired. There are no ups or downs, so I’m not very happy or very sad.
I’m not sure if this is better or worse than just hating everything as usual. ♦

Last Saturday morning I was on a train, waiting for it to start moving towards New York, where there were several Rookie events I was planning to attend, and at some point I realized that I was calm. Calm? How could I be calm when I had spent most of the night before awake, running over directions and coaching myself on how to be as quiet and not-annoying and not-stupid as possible without being one of those people who just stand there fake-smiling through all social events? How could I be calm when I didn’t know where exactly Greenpoint, Brooklyn, is on a map, and yet that was where I was going?
I stared out the window at what looked like an unbroken tunnel of cloud and fog, feeling pleasantly in limbo, sitting in this vessel enveloped in a cloud, completely cut off from the rest of the world. I felt calm. 
Which is maybe why I composed several texts to my brother but didn’t send them. I put my phone away and didn’t even look at it again until late that night, which is when I discovered that my brother had been genuinely worried that I had gotten lost in the city or that someone had stolen my phone and hurt me. This whole trip didn’t feel real, so I hadn’t felt a need to check in with anyone from my real life. 
In New York I tried to hide by moving around a lot in small social settings, and, in larger gatherings, alternating between locking myself in the bathroom and stepping outside when I felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of people around me. I talked to many people I had wanted to talk to, but I worried that all my hiding was making people think I was bored or that I hated them. Unfortunately the only way to maintain my calm was by keeping my distance.
It stormed on the way back.
Now that I’ve been back at school for a week, I feel stupid for the way I acted in New York and stupid for the way I’m acting here. I live in a small dorm with about 80 other people and am becoming known on my hall as “that person who kind of hangs around with that one girl” or as someone a lot of people apparently think hates them. I’ve been trying to find something to join, but I failed to make the literary magazine staff or to find anything else that might work for me.
This next thing is stupid, and it demonstrates a part of my personality that I don’t generally like others to know about—the part that becomes unreasonably emotionally attached to banal objects. But OK, so when I got home I cleaned out the backpack I’d taken to New York and was about to throw out the folded, crumpled piece of paper on which I had written my directions for the trip, then I changed my mind, I brought the paper to my lips, then put it on the windowsill. What a stupid gesture. But that paper felt like a guide to me, and an emblem of safety and ease. I tend to hoard stability and security, even when those things run counter to my best interests. I also hoard myself, which I know is the reason that, when my mother asks if I’ve ever made a connection with any human being outside our family, she expects me to say no. It is also the reason she will be right. 
The worthless slip of paper sits on the windowsill getting bleached by the sun. I sit behind that same window becoming pale and estranged, detached from the rest of humanity. ♦

Today in the woods at the edge of campus, a St. Bernard ran into me and pressed his wet snout against my right hand. It was sweet and goofy. I wanted to say hi and pet him, but his owners called him back. I walked past a professor who knows I’m woefully behind in my work, and almost felt bad about spending a lot of time in those woods this weekend (and going to the mall and the movies the night before). I think a woman saw me wipe a booger on the leaf of a tree.
On my way into the wooded area, I saw a woman and a teenager sitting on a tree that had fallen over the water. They were beautiful, so on my way out I sat where they had sat for a long time before I went back to campus and I felt beautiful but not like myself. I could not feel my own existence. I stared down at a spot where a bunch of leaves had dammed up in the water. I stared at the leaves, and what looked like someone’s phlegm, and the rocks below the surface of the water. Nothing feels real. Writing about it doesn’t make it feel more real, because writing just turns experience into something else.
The night before, after I got home from the movies and read for a while, I heard voices outside my cracked window. I stood up and looked out. If I’m close to the window, I always look when I hear people pass by—I don’t understand people who do homework in public and don’t look at all the people passing by. 
I leaned forward and saw two dudes. “Hi,” one said. His tone was very LOL so I felt LOL and was like, “Hey, ’sup.” Then his friend looked up and was like, “Hey, have a good night,” and I was like “Yeah, thanks. Goodnight,” and I smiled. I always feel invisible when I look at people, but this was like someone throwing dust on me to make my form apparent. It felt OK. It made me know that I am present but didn’t help me feel reality much more keenly—it was still something that happened in a dream state.
I wonder if being around people more will help me feel more real. It never has in the past, but I’m still going to try. People tell me that alcohol will help me talk to strangers at parties (which I’m supposed to do because I haven’t joined anything and party is what you do to meet people if you don’t join anything), but that complicates things because alcohol always makes me feel wayyyy less real. I’m not sure what can help me sense reality. I sense that this will not be resolved soon. ♦

For a while this summer I stopped writing in my notebook and used my cellphone’s text draft folder to store short notes regarding things I would have handwritten entire pages about in the past. My new system was easier and, more important, it made it harder to reread anything I’d written, so I never did. I’ve made the mistake of rereading old journal entries in my notebook before, and it always makes me cringe. It’s embarrassingly obvious in retrospect where I was trying (and failing) to write like whomever I was reading at the moment, and where I was misrepresenting how I really felt about something in an attempt to make myself seem smarter. I get just as disgusted by the occasional lack of effort I see in those pages as I do by evidence of excessive effort wasted on overwrought writing that’s exhausting to read. Typing out abbreviated versions of my thoughts on a tiny keyboard wasn’t that helpful or enjoyable, though, so I eventually stopped recording anything about my days/life altogether. 
I can’t read anything I’ve ever written without weighing and critiquing each and every word choice and sentence construction. Inevitably all my work comes up short, and then I have to fight the urge to try to “fix” it, even the stuff that is clearly beyond saving. I wish I could just burn it all at once, purging myself of my past, most mediocre self and turning my writing into ashes, into waste (which feels like what it has always truly been). 
I’m being annoying right now. But I don’t know how to continue writing and working with the same mind and the same habits that produced everything I hate. ♦

No familiar human saw me as I got on a plane Tuesday on my way to Massachusetts. No one saw me as I took a cab to school, carried my luggage to my dorm, and got my keys. Everything feels vaguely unreal, false the way September sounds cold but is very hot. Who did I tell I was going here? My immediate family, one friend, and my neighbor when she asked about school. I didn’t tell many of my former professors or acquaintances and forgot to tell one of my roommates I wasn’t coming back. 
After carting around my shit in the sickly, soupy air for 45 minutes, I turn into a greasy red hot dog. I go into my room, open the windows, and take off everything except my underwear bottoms, and lay down on my suitcase, breathing deeply to catch the slightly less soup-y air coming in through the window.
I wake up to the sound of someone opening my door, struggle to place where I am, and tilt my head backwards to see a pair of work boots and khakis. I yelp, the handyman looks over, sees me, screams, and fumbles out. I don’t tell anyone until I email Danielle and tell the story to a group of sophomores I met in the cafeteria. Then it feels more like it happened.
Later that night, it rained as I waited outside my dorm for a pizza I would share with some freshmen. While waiting, I think I see a robbery in the faculty offices next door. A man parks a car adjacent to the building, the emergency lights go on, and several men get out. They enter the house through the side porch, and I see a basement light go on, then off. A minute later, two men begin to exit the house from my side, one carrying a clear trash bag with something black inside, look in my general direction, and re-enter the house. I, nervous at this point, moved through the shadows to the other side of the building. I don’t think I hallucinated, but it didn’t feel real. Maybe I should have called campus police, but I felt it wouldn’t work or that everything was fine and I projected my mild fear of being outside at night onto these people.
Later that night, everything was sticking together: sheets to my skin, my thighs to each other when I walked, and all items to the surfaces on which they were resting. I walked through a row of showers on my way to the bathroom—the shower curtains moved backwards as I walked past them, making scraping noises as they unstuck. Calmly thrilled by the effect I was having on the curtains, I pushed one towards the interior of the shower. It made a noise. I act and objects respond.
Saturday night, I walked into town to go to CVS. In the cleaning aisle, an old man farted and leaned slightly my way as he passed. An accident, I thought. As I passed him on my way to another aisle, he bent over and aimed a fart at me, shifting in order to fart at me a few more times as I got further away. I was shocked and grossed out and texted my brother. “Nasty,” he said. Being at school is beginning to feel like reality. ♦

We were on a bus, sated with fast food and images of Harry Styles, after seeing This Is Us at the mall earlier in the afternoon. The fast food made me feel nauseous, and the movie was a little bit disappointing—not enough raw footage, too much 1D source-story rehashing, and excessive fan thanking. You can thank us with backstage footage, FARTHEADS.
It’s dreamy here, and not just because I’m not in Nashville and not at my old college. It feels amazing to wake up in this place, even though there are always kids playing field sports early in the morning and yelling outside my window, or construction workers calling to each other. Waking up to their voices reminds me that I am no longer dormant, and what would usually be annoying feels like little kisses all over my eardrums.
The bus was taking us to a neighboring coed college for a party an upperclassman halfheartedly told us would be fun; a freshman and I decided to tag along with a group of students from our house. As the bus became more and more crowded and noisy, my friend said, “Oh my god—straight girls.” Their energy was aggressively hetero, and would only become more aggressive when we arrived at the other school’s campus and they immediately started flirting with boys. It made me the most uncomfortable person ever, even though I am admittedly a very boy-crazy person who had been giggling about Harry Styles all day. I had assumed that flirting would happen as a by-product of going to a party, but it seemed to be the goal for so many people, a goal people fought toward all night.
We arrived at the campus and followed a large group that disembarked from the bus with purpose, seeming to know where they were going.
My friend and I approached a dorm. Two bros walked out and one of them immediately asked a freshman, “Do you work at Footlocker? Because you look like you do.” We walked past nearly empty cups of alcohol and a cloud of weed smoke, and headed for the door, where bored security guards would halfheartedly check our purses and yawningly point down a stairwell from which bad house music and heat was rising. It was the breath of hell—well, a mild hell, where tons of students stand in a small room and look at one another without dancing or moving much, with the exception of the three or four couples grinding.
We left the basement and wandered around campus for a while, passing two more parties filled with bored kids. People didn’t even look like they were at parties—they looked like extras in a party scene from a movie. Everyone was displaying respect for the tradition of Saturday night on a college campus, but no one looked like they were enjoying themselves. The police raided the second dorm we went to and made students leave. They looked bored too, like they were just going through the required motions.
My first instinct is to call the whole evening a nightmare, but it wasn’t that dramatic—more like a bad dream. And just like in a dream, there were no stakes—my friend and I wanted to go to a different campus with some other first-years, and we accomplished that. No one really cared that this night was below average because it didn’t truly matter; the dream vanished as soon as we fell asleep in our own beds. ♦

I’m sorry to say that things have not been moving very quickly this week. I am not up to speed with my classes, and nothing has progressed except a constant and fluctuating anxiety. My mind is in stasis; when I sit down to write I feel aphasic—like I only know one word, and that is aphasic, and I only know that because I read it in Slouching Towards Bethlehem. This week’s reliefs included finding out that there is a trick to making the water machine in the cafeteria dispense water quickly and without a drawn-out honking noise, experiencing the joy of explaining eggs Benedict to someone who had never heard of it, and kayaking with some first-years from my house on the school’s pond, where I saw five dogs, three of which were cute, and many families, all of which had hot dads. I got pond water—which everyone tells me has E. coli in it—in my mouth and eye and spent the weekend worrying about getting sick, but I am fine. I am not up to speed with my classes or my classmates, though, which is beginning to be not fine. ♦

On Sunday morning, I tried to read the texts I’d received throughout the night, but my phone wouldn’t respond. I panicked, pushing all the buttons again and again, turned the phone on and off, pushed more buttons, and slowly resigned myself to the reality that all my phone will ever let me do anymore is scroll through my contacts. I emailed my parents, and they told me that since I’ve had my phone for so long, I can basically get a new iPhone for free. 
The sales representative asked if I wanted to transfer my contacts while he pushed a bunch of keys on the new phone. I thought about the phone numbers I have written down on a notecard on my desk: It has all the numbers I dial a lot, plus a few I didn’t feel like I had the right to call but did anyway. If I said no to this transfer, all I’d have were the numbers on that card. 
“Um, like, I don’t know—I, like, probably have what I need I guess. Sorry?”
“It’ll take no time at all.”
My mind started spiraling. Should I take the transfer? I wondered. Did I even want to talk to any of the other people on my contacts list? Most of them were people I only know because we did an English project together, or because they used their ID to get me a drink, or because we were friends in 10th grade, when I got the phone.
“Dude,” the guy says, “it’s not a big deal.” 
“NO. I don’t want it…I don’t want to. I’m sorry.”
So now I have an iPhone, and my brother’s texts come in gray bubbles of varying sizes instead of uniform white boxes. When I read my brother’s texts on my old phone, I could hear his voice in my head, but I can’t do that with the gray bubbles. We haven’t texted as much since I got the new phone. 
My world is small right now, and it feels weird. I feel unsure about how I act around people. Even though I should be freaking out that I’m still behind in my schoolwork and my mind feels like hot wet cotton from spending long stretches of time trying to speed-read books (and then using Spark Notes anyway because I read too fast to retain anything), I freaked out about the new phone more. It’s just this stupid, obvious metaphor for moving to a strange place and having to let go of your old life and the relationships that used to define you, and replacing them all with something new. 
I hate that my family will read this and think that I’m a total negative bummer zone. This is just what being in a new place for the second year in a row feels like. Everything’s cool—it just takes time. ♦

I see the orange glow of the sun through my eyelids, even though I picked the shadiest part of the graveyard, under the intertwining branches of three tall trees. I open my eyes for a moment and notice that the position of the sun has changed dramatically since I first sat down. It doesn’t sink in until I’ve closed my eyes again what this means. My eyes snap open and I whip out my cellphone to check the time. I’ve been sitting here for four and a half hours.
That’s four and a half hours of wasted effort. I have accomplished nothing. I stand up and want to kick something over, but the only objects in my line of sight are tombstones, and it seems inappropriate to kick those.

“I tried to kill myself when I stopped meditating,” Penny* had said. Her eyes had widened with excitement, and her thick glasses enlarged them even more. “That’s how I know it actually did something for me! I wasn’t crazy!” She looked down at her sneakers, shoelace-less since we weren’t allowed any “dangerous” items in the hospital. She looked up at me and we both giggled. “Well, you know. Not crazy in that way.”

I have been trying to meditate for weeks and I just can’t get a hold of my subconscious. That’s my goal: to push out my conscious thoughts so I can contemplate my subconscious. I never quite get down to that level, though—it feels like waking up from a dream too fast and trying desperately to grasp the memory before it’s gone forever. Getting my conscious mind to leave my physical body is the only part of meditation I feel I have succeed at, not that it matters, but that’s only step one. Step two for me would be to leave the ground floor of my mind, the part that houses stuff like instincts and needless minutia.
~~~~
Meditation saved Penny. Her experiment with stopping, she said, proved it. When changing her environment and giving her meds didn’t work, meditation did. “We are here because our thoughts are tangled,” she told me once. “You just need to learn to organize and compartmentalize them.”
“I already compartmentalize my thoughts,” I’d replied. “I try to separate everything. I just can’t do it like you can.”
“If you can teach yourself to lucid dream, you can teach yourself to meditate.”
“How did you know about that?” I asked, bewildered.
“You told me yesterday. They’d put you on some new drug and it didn’t work, remember? It made you super dizzy.” I vaguely remembered that. Oh.
~~~~
I decide to try again, but I don’t want to waste another day this time. I return to the old cemetery and sit. I imagine every part of my body shutting off like a machine, starting from my toes and going up. Very slowly, my body begins to drop out of its normal over-stimulated state, and I can focus more clearly on my thoughts. I visualize all the things I think about day-to-day falling slowly into mental filing cabinets, one by one lining up for analysis. I feel completely relaxed and—
“FREAK!”
I am suddenly shaken back into reality by two girls leaning out the window of a passing car. “Talking to ghosts because you have no friends?” they taunt. I sigh as they speed away, laughing as if they are comic masterminds. I give up.
All I want to do is understand myself, and if not through meditation like Penny, I don’t know how. I want to know what is under my mind’s top layer of thought and go deeper. Much deeper. ♦

Rows and rows of desks, dark gray, full of 15-year-olds who don’t want to be here. Well, they kind of do. They want the result: passing a class, getting a decent grade, getting into college. But nobody actually enjoys sitting in class for seven hours, even for driver’s ed.
I don’t know anybody here. It’s a feeling I haven’t felt in a while, and I realize how much I missed it.
I think back to this time two years ago. I had just finished eighth grade at that tiny Quaker school with no friends. There were a couple of people who were just beginning to pass the acquaintance line, but I never worked to make it happen. I didn’t know about or need friends. When you don’t have many friends or a social life, you’re left looking at things instead of doing things. It’s a freedom, of sorts. I had no social expectations or obligations. I was just the weird girl that some people supposedly thought was cool but nobody actually knew. Some people liked me, some hated me, and I felt exactly the same way about them. The problem for me was that everyone noticed me. In a small school, I stood out anyway.
Coming to high school was a dream. It’s the biggest school I’ve ever been to, and my black clothes and platform shoes turn far fewer heads. No one looks at you here. 
When I got here I decided to try making friends. It was a reluctant decision—I would have to give up the freedom of not having to deal with social relationships and the risks that come with them (drama, fighting, rejection, being noticed). And it wasn’t easy to do it. I didn’t even know how. 
When I hung out with people, I would take notes—facts about them to study and remember. I maintained a short bio for each of my new friends and I studied them. But soon I was speaking to too many people per day to keep track of each one. 
I loved this new life. I had studied or this having-friends test and I had passed. I have friends now that I love more than anything. They’re a second family. Really.
But sometimes I miss being alone.
Awkwardly shuffling towards the back of the room, I take a seat between a blond girl in a ribbed white tank top and a guy in a snapback. The girl gives me a disgusted look and shifts her desk noticeably away from me, making her friends giggle. Inside, I smile. I feel utterly alone, and the nostalgia is overwhelming.
When the class ends, I walk into town alone. I loiter outside Dunkin Donuts and people-watch, listening to King Crimson. I go into the woods by the bike path and sit very quietly. I haven’t had a date with myself in at least a month. The breeze blows around me. It’s warm but not at all humid and the wind rustles the leaves just enough. The day is perfect. I remember life without friends. I remember the years when I spent every day like this, and I think of them fondly. I think of all the stories I wrote during that time, the books I read, the music I listened to, the hopeless celebrity crushes, the hopeless real-life crushes, the hopeless friend crushes. Being alone wasn’t all sad—I know myself very, very well because of it.
My cell beeps the Kim Possible pager tone. I take it out. It’s from Ben: What’s up?
And I remember that I have a boyfriend and I have friends and I have a social life and that I unexpectedly love it. I love every one of them. My first-ever friends.
I’m going to keep looking back fondly on those solitary years. I’ll spend days like this occasionally, just watching the day go by. I will always remember the great times I’ve spent with imaginary friends and fictional characters, but those years of romantic lonesomeness are behind me. Deciding to try out real friendship was the best choice I have ever made. ♦

I was on Davis’s bed a week ago. My back was towards him and he hooked his arms through mine and used his body like a lever to lift me up and put me down, over and over. I was all, “Woah cool don’t stop.” #noincest
Later in the week we were snuggling and Davis was all, “In two weeks we won’t see each other again until Christmas.” I’d been lying with my arm draped over his torso, but now I pressed my whole body into his (no incest) and tightened my arms around him. He laughed.
Last night, while Davis and I were walking back to the car after dinner, some of his friends gestured at him from the window of a restaurant. “Is that your sister?” one girl mouthed. We nodded. “You guys look so much alike!” I shrugged in order to say “What are you going to do about it?” 
We decided to go see Blue Jasmine, which was terrible. I got frustrated halfway through and thought about telling Davis I wanted to leave. He leaned over and asked me a question I couldn’t hear, so I went with, “Oh, you want to leave? Sure, we can leave.” He laughed and said there was nothing else we would or could do. 
We felt relieved as we walked through the theater hallway, mildly pleased with ourselves as we got on the escalator, and giddy as we ascended to the lobby. We had almost reached the exit when I felt a sharp pain in my head, followed by a feeling like my brain was clinching up. I had never left a movie early before, and even though this one sucked, not knowing how it would end was causing me actual physical discomfort. We slowed down and looked at each other. “We have to go back,” Davis said.
The second half of the movie was just as bad as the first, and afterward we had to walk it off. The neighborhood felt apocalyptic to me. Before dinner we had seen a group of people all in white face makeup and wearing cassocks with red collars and glittering veils walking around, and I could still feel their presence as Davis and I walked. He criticized a new way of speaking I’ve affected and I thanked him. His critiques mad me angry early this summer, but now I find them helpful. They make me feel cared for. 
Later that night, I called him a “total dream.” “I’m a dream?!” he said.
When he woke up this afternoon, he came downstairs and hugged me. He smelled like peanut butter. “What if you weren’t cute?” he said. I’m cute?! 
Summer has been a few bad movies and a lot of being tackled by my brother. One more week. ♦

I’m having trouble coming up with a topic that I want to write more than 100 words about. I’m struggling to write about anything of interest. I feel frustrated.
Right now I’m just chilling in my room, trying to finish this summer reading and answering my parents’ questions about the details of my upcoming trip up to school. I just finished my summer job, where I sat alone in a room entering numbers into a computer. I can’t write about any of this without feeling like I’m boring and self-pitying. ♦

I’m home alone on Thursday night, packing for a family vacation. My brother and my parents have already left; I’m flying down the next morning with my grandmother, who has needed someone to accompany her since her surgery last year. When I step into the bathroom to brush my teeth I am NOT happy with what I find there—my brother’s full tube of Colgate, my crusty, empty tube of Crest, and the ripped-open box of what would have been my new toothpaste. I scream and throw the empty box at the wall. 
A week ago, I accidentally locked my brother and his friend out of the house. I opened the back door to the house and when I went back inside, I locked the door out of habit. When I finally figured out what ha happened and let my brother back into the house, he stared at me and hissed, “Ohhhhhhh. Maiiyyyyyyy. Godddddddddd.” He later told me that his friend had said, “This isn’t the first stupid thing she’s done.”
Not too long ago, my brother made a huge deal of me dropping a glass of water while I was talking to him in the kitchen. It was my fault—I gesture with my hands when I speak and I’m relatively clumsy, so I spill or knock something over about once a week. Every time he makes a comment about my mistakes, he makes it clear that he thinks I am stupid by rolling his eyes, lowering his chin and recounting every other time I’ve messed up. I’m not just clumsy or spacey, his expression implies, but a special kind of stupid that only I could be. 
I send my brother a text: “W T F why did u take my tube of tuthpaste when u have a FULL TUBE and I JUST GOT BACK FROM WALGREENS” followed by about one million texts saying “O M G,” “Never talk to me again,” or “Easily the stupidest thing you’ve ever done”—all verbatim reactions he’s had to similarly small mistakes I’ve made in the past. He texts back three words: “Get a grip.” I’ve lost. ♦

Going on vacation makes me feel like my organs have crawled out of my body and my skin is tightening around what’s left. I spent most of last week in my bedroom with the lights off. My brother would periodically look in and be all, “You’re depressing me.” I wouldn’t react.
We were on a family trip to Georgia. I walked on the beach with my dad one night and felt spiritual communion with a ghost crab. We are both nocturnal, pale, and unpleasant. Hello little weirdie, I thought to the crab. It didn’t react.
The final night we were there, my brother called me while riding his bike. “Do you want to trespass?” he asked. Three minutes later I was on my dad’s bike. We rode down a thin path, Davis leading the way with a flashlight, me pedaling behind, trying to see the outlines of the path and the trees. Every so often I would brush against bushes or find myself having veered into the grass. If it were any darker out I would have felt I was pedaling in place. After a while, I saw a light up ahead. The path had taken us to a road that was enclosed by a ribcage-like canopy of trees. There was more light there, and I could make out dead possum and clumps of grass that lay limp and mute on the road. Everything else was screaming: frogs and my breath and the wind if I turned my head to the side. 
We turned off the road into a driveway, parked our bikes facing the road, and walked around a concrete wall and up to the incomplete mansion. There was a patio with an infinity pool, and beyond that a black marsh. We got in the pool and talked about how we wished someone else was there with us. I held my brother while he floated. I walked him around in circles until I was hypnotized. I asked him to do the same for me so I could look at the stars, and he said I sound like a bad short story. He sounded like a TV show that acts self-aware but actually has no idea what it is—even though he is nothing like that.
The next day I listened to a flight attendant try to be clever with her safety speech. When I got home, it was like nothing happened. ♦

I look at the little analog clock on the corner of the computer screen. I have been in summer school for 1.5 hours. That’s exactly half a day. Our days are short, which is good because I have friends as of this year, and even a boyfriend, and I love all those people a lot. I kinda have it all, in that regard at least. For now.
I am going to be a sophomore in high school after summer school is over. Then I’ll be 16. That is the age you think of when you think of teenagers. It’s where the kids from Glee started (R.I.P. Cory), the age of Jeremy from Zits, the age of all the characters on that stupid show Victorious or Victory or whatever. It’s the age of this cool girl at my school who had a shaved head and cool makeup and boots. I think Lindsay Weir was 16, but I can’t remember. I’m pretty sure Kim Possible is, too. It’s like the default age for teens. By 16 you are a sophomore or a junior and you look like an adult and act like an adult and you drive and are all grown up.
Maybe that’s just in my head and none of it is correct.
This entire year flew by in a blur and so will next year and the next one and the one after that. And I’ll be in the real world. I don’t care about being alone in the world. I am just scared that I won’t know what to do so I’ll do nothing.
Realistically, I’m not going to go to a good college. I always thought about going to an Ivy League, or maybe McGill. I don’t know why, but in middle school I thought I would continue being smart and successful forever. Maybe I’ll go to Bennington, if I can get in, because writing is the only thing I have going for me. It’s the only class I don’t fail miserably in. It’s the only subject I can enjoy and the only one I have real experience in. My mom went to Bennington for her master’s degree. I was at her graduation. I was proud of her, and I think if I graduated she would have been proud of me, even if I went to a shit school.
So maybe I’ll end up at community college, which I’ve been taught to think is pathetic, or maybe a really hippie one that doesn’t have real grades. I won’t get into any decent school in New York, so that’s pretty much off the table even though Brooklyn is my dream.
Then I’ll get a mediocre job, be a failing writer in a competitive world, and hate my teenage self for blowing my chances and wasting my life trying to survive instead of living.
This isn’t a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is realism. I know I’m not going to do well.
This is why I don’t want to grow up. I’m destined to have a mediocre life, and there’s no way I’m starting a family just to make them deal with that. 
The only thing I can ever have is the present. Sixteen is the default, and it’s when you are still sheltered but you can learn and experience everything. I think it will be the best year of my life. ♦

I made a new friend recently. I’ll call him S. He is in the grade below me. He approached me one day when it was hot and sunny, in a field with no shade outside the middle school. He had drawn all over his jeans in Sharpie and was wearing what might have been a band T-shirt but might have also been a club or a company name. He looked young with his short brown hair framing his round face.
“Would you like to be friends?” he asked. I said yes. I wish all friendships started so officially! No guessing whether someone is a friend or just a friendly person. No worries about fakeness. I liked this kid.
After my band’s next gig S. invited my whole group of friends to his house, even though he only knew a couple of us. His house was filled with ornaments and tapestries; it smelled like fire and incense and bread. We walked down a narrow winding staircase and into a glowing room.
“This is my room,” he said. It was huge and filled with colored lights. There were lamps and fairy lights everywhere splashing a million colors across the walls, which were covered with art and license plates. We gaped at the lush carpet and the comfortable-looking couches and the hundreds of places to sit or lie down. We fawned over the Buddhist shrine and the TV and the books. The room was dark but full of candles and rainbow mirrors everywhere. That doesn’t make sense, but that’s the only way to describe S.’s room. It was beautiful. We were in awe. We started gushing about it simultaneously, and S. looked a little embarrassed. “I’m an only child,” he explained.
We watched Birdemic, and it was horribly lovely. We played with fake blood and fire and goggles in the dark.
I hung out with S. alone the next day. It turned out that we had all the same psychological issues and similar experiences, like losing a parent, having been bullied, and hating therapy.
I could already tell we were going to be good friends. I could share things with him that I’ve never told anyone—not even parents, friends, or therapists.
This friendship is going to be good for me. ♦

I started a part-time job in an accounting office the other week. I’m doing work that robots will eventually do because they’re faster and make fewer errors—sorting through packets of information and entering numbers into a spreadsheet that does calculations automatically for me. I’m as apathetic as one should be about a summer job, but when I finish at 4:30 each afternoon, I walk into my dad’s office and am all, “Guess how many packets I got through today???!” He usually guesses 9 or 10 and raises his eyebrows and I’m like, “I got through 12 but I bet I can do 13 tomorrow.” His vibe is mostly like “LOL, sure, see you at home.”
I’m working at my dad’s office because he got me a job there. Sure, it’s kind of low in terms of summer work. Maybe the lowest. Instead of going out into the world and finding something myself, I just chilled around until my dad offered me a job. So now I have to live with the mild to moderate shame of willfully ceding control of this one piece of my life. 
The work is solitary, and the office environment doesn’t promote interaction, so I’m gaining information about my co-workers slowly. There’s a temp worker who confirms things with “cool beans,” a woman who’s good with the copier and whom I can always hear laughing with the employee she’s training, and a woman who likes to talk about how everyone else in the office is “stuck up” and told me that a portable crockpot would have made her college years so much happier. There’s also this woman who, when she leaves at 4 o’clock, says “good night” instead of “have a good afternoon” or “see you tomorrow.” It creates the sense that after she leaves the office, she is completely done with her day. I imagine her walking home and getting into bed without changing clothes or doing anything besides lifting the sheets and getting under them. I imagine her smiling the whole time. ♦

Every once and a while my dad does something that’s absolutely game changing, and the earth holds its breath for a second. This week it happened while he was hanging out in my room with my brother and me. We were all on my bed, snuggling and talking, when my dad started tugging at bits of my brother’s hair and being all, “Rafael. Rafaeeell… Rafael?” (We don’t know a Rafael.) He also keeps on asking me if I want to ride bikes or swim laps with him. I always say no, and then he looks really disappointed in this way that is really cute and important. The other day I told him that riding bikes makes me nervous and that I can’t swim laps because I take in too much water and hate it, and now I’m afraid that I’ve screwed up literally EVERYTHING because he might stop asking me every day, and if that happens I’ll be devastated. Like, watching Carrie Bradshaw cry devastated.
Also a big deal was that I did something crazy and got into my two top schools as of Friday. WHOOPS. This wasn’t supposed to happen! One was supposed to deny me, thus deciding my fate. Now I have to choose pretty much right away, and I have no idea what to do. My parents keep on asking me what my decision is and I keep saying that I’ll have to make a pro/con list. I know that won’t help because I’ve been going over the pros and cons for weeks and have no way to weigh them. “What’s a deciding factor for you?” my dad keeps on asking me. I usually just shrug, pour a glass of milk, and go upstairs to my room. I know this is a good problem to have. But I did such a bad job of choosing my last school, which was a literal NIGHTMARE, that I no longer trust myself with these decisions.
I just want to go somewhere where, when I’m talking to someone, if I say something SLIGHTLY surprising, they don’t say “you’re weird” and end the conversation. It happened all the time in class last year and with people in high school. People would ask if I was on drugs, which I am not, and as much as I wish I could claim the label of rebellious eccentric, I’m a big hit with people’s moms and with random nurses in hospitals, so I can’t be that weird. ♦

I pulled my trashcan close to my bed, because I thought I was going to vomit. I told my dad that I would decide by morning which college I would be attending next year, since my deposit for one of the schools was due on Friday. I made lists and flipped a coin several times, but I only managed to make my throat feel tight, like it was being pulled by a finger trap toy. I went to our back porch to smoke and drink milk, and I felt disgusted with myself. Why was I being such a drama queen? I mean, where you go to college is a big deal, as I learned by suffering for a full school year for the mistake I made the first time around. But after seeing the trailer for this Tina Fey movie (to which I give like 10 eyerolls), I’m sick of feeling like applying to and choosing a college is a grand cinematic journey.
I fell asleep after emptying the milk carton. The next afternoon, when he looked like he was about to talk to me about it, I yelled at him: “DON’T ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS.” I ran up to my room and repeated everything I had done the night before, but this time, before I went to bed, I left a note on the counter telling him I had chosen Bard. I picked that school after my brother told me to not “be embarrassed about what makes you happy.” When I visited Bard and Smith (the other school that accepted me) back in April, I liked the vibe more at Bard. “Leave me a check so I can mail the deposit today,” I wrote. “Stay cool.” Then I went to bed, my stomach still in knots.
The next morning I woke up in a panic. I called my dad to tell him I had changed my mind. I had convinced myself I liked Bard because of its aesthetic: It’s dark, surrounded by woods, and the students are, for the most part, impeccably dressed. It was #beautiful like the Mariah Carey and Miguel song (and just like Mimi and Miguel) but my romantic view of the school somehow made me want to forget everything I liked about Smith, which is where I ultimately decided to go. After I called my dada second time, I was excited—I unloaded the dishwasher in maybe 60 seconds, spent hours trying to memorize the campus layout, and even used exclamation points in texts, which is soooo not my jam. ♦

My parents went on a trip and I’ve spent the week at home without them. Not much has changed except I killed my mom’s basil plant forgetting to water it and I possibly gained some weight. The latter I’m not sure about because I would never weigh myself with the family scale because it says “THINNER” on it and I’m grossed out by that. Every time I go to the doctor the person weighing me is like, “Wow…you hide it well, though,” wayyyy condescendingly. I would never tell someone about to stick a needle in me to fuck off, so I just roll my eyes and don’t acknowledge it further. I don’t know if they think that’s a compliment, but I kind of have a problem with people who mean to compliment or help you and end up being the worst. You all suck no matter your intention, suckbutts. Weighing is a lie and McFlurries are the only truth in the world.
Actually a concern is that I feel my muscles are atrophying. I was walking around my old college’s campus a few days ago and my legs felt slow to respond to my brain’s message to GET MOVING and I was like, “Hey, have my muscles atrophied?” I asked my dad to print out a schedule for yoga classes at the Y near my house. I’m against getting fit, but I might do this because I’m afraid of my muscles turning to goo and because I once tried yoga in high school and I liked it. It made me feel like a cat but also forced me to (unsuccessfully) confront my fear of handstands and forward rolls. In middle school I faked a hurt neck to justify my tears over having to do a forward roll in class. I was sent to the nurse’s office where I was given a Tums and some ice and dismissed. (Our school nurse would give you Tums first thing, no matter what you came in with.) If I wimp out in the real world no one will even give me inappropriate medications; I’ll just have to face my shame alone.
In other news, I watched I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream 2 and became infatuated with Sarah Michelle Gellar’s mouth, so I’m watching Buffy whenever I have something I should be doing. There is something about the way it moves when she’s upset and talking, and the way she purses her lips together when she’s determined, that captivates me. Also, I’m also ready to move to Toronto because I think I could be legitimate BFFs with this guy named Juan from the MTV Canada show 1 Girl 5 Gays, something I wasn’t interested in because I thought it would be five gay men giving a woman fashion advice or something horrible like that, but I was happy to learn that it’s a talk show where one woman asks five gay men 20 questions, prompting discussion. I’m #blessed by this show because of cast members like Juan. Although he’s not the smartest on the show (Dean) or the funniest (JP), Juan has major charisma. And I know we would have at least one subject to talk about because he cried when he met Sarah Jessica Parker. He also owns 36 Barbra Streisand records, and although I don’t know much about Streisand, that part in Funny Girl where Fanny meets Nick Arnstein and sings his name holds a special place in my heart. Juan could show me more Streisand moments before we discuss the complexity of Sex and the City and then who knows what else?!!! ♦

I dig up my old French textbooks and begin to examine them in order to figure out what I do and do not remember. I list everything I want to review: verb tenses and grammar concepts I know I can’t recall without help, vocabulary words we never covered in class, and certain readings that looked interesting and challenging enough to be valuable. I write “Summer Curriculum” at the top of a page and organize the information from my old textbooks into units. I edit the list until I am sure that everything on it is helpful and easy to accomplish before the end of summer. On a separate page, I list French movies and additional reading materials. I realize that I am flaring my nostrils and gripping my pen too tightly; I take a break without actually studying, and still feel mad at myself for doing so.
I need to become fluent before I’m 21. In high school there was a kid who made it his mission to become fluent in Spanish in four years. He didn’t reach his goal, but our teacher would always use him as an example of how far we should have progressed. Last year there was a girl in my French class who had taken two years of French and could speak it with perfect grammar and pronunciation. I feel like It’s good to know more than one language, and I know that I have both the education and ability to speak French more proficiently than I do. I’ve taken six years of the language and managed to win all but one French-student award in high school—yet I can’t speak it without pausing to mentally conjugate verbs and rearrange entire sentences. I should be better by now.
I think about what I know and what I do not know—how I form my opinions, and how people around me form their opinions. I think about this when I wake up and lie in bed, not moving, when I go to see a movie, and when I’m talking to my parents or grandparents, listing trivia about my new school. I think about the coming school year—what will it be like, and what can I get out of it. I don’t mind being pragmatic or thinking analytically, but I’m ready for my internal monologue to change or evolve. Given time, it usually does. ♦

Recent stress over finals has amplified all of my other anxieties. Right now, for instance, I want to delete all of my social-networking accounts and move away from the internet forever. As a recluse and someone who frequently fakes sick in order to leave any event early, the internet is supposed to be my best friend: I can take time to find the right word when talking to someone. I can look at my crushes without the danger that comes with side-eyeing them IRL. Facebook, in particular, can be an invaluable tool during a significant transition, like moving from one school to another and communicating with people you’ve just met—it was practically invented for shy people. 
But it also feels like this giant party where I don’t have the option of leaving early and texting everyone to say I got food poisoning from dinner. As much love as I have for Facebook chat and emoticon poetry, the fact that every major social event you attend can be commemorated with pictures that might be on your wall forever makes it feel like that event is never really over, like it’s a mega-event that includes EVERYTHING YOU’VE EVER DONE. Whenever I start to think about the fact that people can look at photos of me from prom or my senior play, or read my conversation with someone else about babies’ mouths and their weird toothless gums, I freak out, because I feel like I’m always being observed. When I freak out in public, I hide in a bathroom or go somewhere where I can be alone. But I’m always visible on the internet.
I don’t feel nostalgia for times past when Facebook and Twitter didn’t exist. I roll my eyes in a major way when someone says, “We’re all just so plugged-in these days.” It’s just that if I say something stupid when hanging out with people, it will hurt for a minute, but I can walk away and make an effort to not say stupid shit the next time. When I say something stupid on the internet, it’s going to be there for a long time. And if I wanted to forget about it, I would have to delete it, which would cause everyone to notice that I have a crippling lack of self-confidence, which CANNOT HAPPEN. 
Speaking of the internet, last week I learned, courtesy of a White Castle advertisement I saw while checking my email, that fried-chicken rings exist in the world. I’m not shocked, and I’m not judging you if you like them. They just make me sad. They’re ring-shaped pieces of chicken that are deep-fried and sprinkled with ranch-flavored powder. Take a moment to imagine the employees of White Castle forming chicken meat into rings (which is how I assume this goes down, but I don’t know), dropping those rings into a deep-fryer, then pulling them out and covering them with powder (as if we can’t just dip them in ranch dressing in accordance with the popular practice), and tell me you don’t feel bummed? Everything on the internet is a bummer, even if, relative to other things, it isn’t a bummer. After trying to cope with everything else, I run into sad chicken ads? I may just delete my Facebook account and avoid sad chicken by going out and living in the real world. ♦

In my early teenage years, between the ages of 12 to 16, I was very restrained. Restraint was more than a behavior for me; it was a core belief: I believed that I should be quiet and reserved, that I shouldn’t be noticed, that I should practice moral restraint, and that if you disagreed with an oppressive or faulty institution or system of power, the best way to change it was to make that system work for you, rather than do something crazy like try to overthrow the bad system. I felt very dull during that time, like I was looking at the world through a fogged-up lens. 
Somewhere around my 16th birthday, I stopped believing in God. I separated from my former friend group. I started writing more. Then these weird moments started happening, these abrupt shifts in consciousness that take over my brain without warning. It happens like this: I’m doing some banal task—sitting in class, starting my car, or about to fall asleep—and then suddenly everything feels different. I become completely aware that I’m a human and of what that means. I’m aware of every part of my anatomy and can feel mortality in the front balls of my feet. The objects around me become outlined in light. This lasts about 30 seconds before I return to my former state, but with a residual hyperconsciousness that fades after about a minute. 
 These moments have been occurring with greater and greater frequency. I want them to happen more and last longer, because they’re the one time when I feel like I can turn off all of my brain’s pragmatic, rational filters and act on instinct. I feel fully myself, like I have my very own mind that’s separate from everybody else’s. I no longer feel like a zombie.
I just finished my freshman year of college, and my only year at this particular college. During my final month there I felt like the lens I was looking at the world through turned the color that Cheeto dust turns after it’s soaked up the moisture at the tips of your fingers: a toxic and aggressive orange. I stopped showering and doing laundry and stayed in my room as much as I could. If I was hungry, I got something from the basement vending machines, and I was so on edge that I screamed in fear every time one of my roommates came into the room late at night. I skipped the classes that had lots of students in them, and the stuff we were being taught in the other ones seemed cheap and consumable and made me feel sick. I felt like everything around me was coated in some sticky substance, and I didn’t want to look at or touch anything I didn’t have to. Sometimes I went to hang out with my brother and started to feel better for a while, but my former state of mind would return as soon as I returned to my dorm.
Final exams ended last week, and I moved out. My RA did an obligatory final check of my dorm room before I left. The walls were white and ripped in several places from where I hung lights and a banner, and the rest of the room looked clean and empty. I kept on saying how weird the room looked now that we were all moving out, but that’s not how I felt. The room looked how it always felt to me: white and empty. 
I’m home now, and my mental state can best be described as lukewarm water dribbling from the faucet—no longer grimy Cheeto-dust orange, but still a little murky. I’m trying to shock myself into my hyper-aware state by reading, talking to my brother, and trying to think in full sentences—those things do the trick sometimes. I wonder if I can ever make that state permanent. I wonder if that happens when you grow up. ♦

Things that were sort of not the best this week:

Going to Alabama to help at my grandfather’s estate sale and hearing about a lot of random people’s diabetes, bladder infections, and Weight Watchers experiences.
My family members loudly asking “how it went” when I returned after disappearing for an hour. I know I’m, like, the #1 cheerleader for talking about “gross” stuff, but it’s not cool. There’s conceivably a funny way to do this, but no one there had found it. For the record, I took a nap because I was tired after playing chase/hide-and-seek for hours.

Things I did not like at all about this week:

At the estate sale, I ended up babysitting my five-year-old cousin. Look, it’s fine that I had to do it, because I’m so inept at negotiating with people and lifting things that I would have otherwise been useless, but children are Not Cute. Also, I failed to act according to my beliefs. For instance, I believe that you shouldn’t let children win at games just because they are younger and supposedly cute. HOWEVER, this twerp beat me at every game of cards and almost every race. “You’re just letting me win,” she kept on saying. Uh, no, girl—I don’t like you, I’m just a really slow runner. I did succeed in following my rule of using really big words and asking difficult questions. Children should be confused, because they need to know that the world is a confusing place and they should start figuring out how to make it less scary.
Talking to a certain family member who always asks me if I know my cousin was born out of wedlock and that her father is black. This weekend she also told me to make sure my cousin didn’t steal anything from the sale.

Things I did a lot of this week:

Read through the Craigslist classifieds. Found nothing. Read through them again. Reluctantly bookmarked at least one posting.
Said “YOLO.”
Narcissism: selfies. Twitter. Drunk selfies. Drunk Twitter. You get the idea.

Something I realized this week:

I’m aces at charming nurses. They LOVE me. I’ve always felt bummed about not having a special mundane talent (being double-jointed or able to recite the alphabet backwards), but now I know mine. Self-discovery!

Things I really liked about this week:

Driving all the way to Decatur, Alabama, alone at night. When you get to Decatur you cross a river and pass a tower that says Decatur: Home of Meow Mix.
My brother is home. We YOLO a lot.
RuPaul’s Drag Race reunion episode confirmed my suspicion that humans might be incredible sometimes. ♦

This summer is already legendary. So legendary it needs to be commemorated with souvenirs.
I need someone to make me one of those T-shirts they sell at surf-shop chains that say “Summer Break 2013,” but instead of images of, like, sunshine and palm trees, mine would picture me in bed with a piping-hot Wild Berry Pop Tart and a glass of milk. 
Or it could have a picture of me speaking on the phone with these words in bubble text: “It’s just that something’s not there anymore. I don’t want to hang out anymore. We don’t have anything in common, we never hang out, and when we do, it’s uncomfortable.” With this one I’d need a matching shirt for my former best friend, showing her response to my phone call: “That’s not what this is. It doesn’t matter if we don’t talk a lot. This friendship is us meeting up every once in a while to catch up. I thought this was going to be forever. You were going to be a bridesmaid at my wedding. We’ve been together for 10 years. When I left school there was a reason you were the only person I kept in touch with after high school. You were having a hard time getting along with girls there, and I supported you. I felt bad for you. Good luck ever finding anyone else.” Maybe up above that text, or on the back, there would be a picture of me sitting in my car in the Kroger parking lot, my phone on the floor, staring into the distance.
When I got home, my mother had gotten a text from my ex-best-friend’s mother telling her that the ex-BFF was very upset. This upset my mother. She asked me where my morals are. At this point I took the high road by making my voice as deep as possible and snarling at her that I was Satan. I could tell this did not go over well with my mother, because her response was “Is that how you really feel?” instead of the “Oh, I’m wrongly accusing you of having no heart, I’ll leave you alone” that I was going for. For my mother, the devil is real, making my impersonation even more obnoxious, and this incident probably harder to recover from. I can’t figure out an appropriate souvenir to commemorate this event. Matching mood necklaces so that we can read each other’s emotions in our next fight? A ceramic plaque that says “Maybe don’t impersonate the devil” that I can hang next to the one she already owns that reads “Together we can do great things. —God”? A sculpture of two google-eyed dried fish—a puffer and a crab—duking it out, with our names and “SUMMER 2013” written underneath? I can’t decide. I’ll probably just get a boob mug, because boobs belong to women and women are crazy and fight a lot. That’ll keep the memory fresh. (JK OBV) WISH YOU WERE HERE, ROOKS. ♦

My dad keeps on doing this thing where after he talks to me about helping him stain the porch or about when I might get a job, he starts to tell me what a good life I have. He tells me that even though I hated people at my high school, I received a great education and I have pretty much everything I need and most of the things I want. He usually references these diaries as examples of my dissatisfaction.
I explain to him that it’s the nature of a diary to write what’s on my mind and not to say things like: “I woke up. I rewatched some Gilmore Girls and came up with darker endings. In one episode, Rory poisons Dean’s food in a feminist rage after he says he likes the idea of having a wife who does the housework in a dress and pearls. After that, Rory and Lorelai off anyone who makes a sexist remark. By the end, Emily and Richard reveal that they actually murdered a man to get that vacation home in Martha’s Vineyard. The last shot is of Babette’s late cat Cinnamon rising from the grave to take revenge on Luke, who served meatloaf, of all things, at the wake. Then I read, got McFlurries with Davis, and lip-synched for my life to Carly Rae Jepsen’s ‘Take a Picture’ and it was really fun.” That’s a pretty shitty diary. 
However, I’ve noticed, and so has my dad, that this idea of a tragic Katherine, one who constantly longs for human interaction like a character in Winesburg, Ohio, often shows up in my writing and my sense of humor. She’s part of my persona, even though it’s not how I want to think of myself or how I want to be. My high-school social life was not the most vibrant, but as one of my friends once told me, “You can be a total bitch sometimes.” Which is totally true. 
It’s just like this Winesburg Katherine is always calling me on the phone to remind me she exists. And I’m like, “What are you doing? Go the fuck away.” And in her best Ghostface voice, she’s all, “I AM YOU. I’M IN YOUR SPEECH, YOUR CHARACTER, YOUR 3 PM POP-TART.” And I’m like, “Sorry for leading you on, but I don’t want you here anymore.” At which point she just laughs, because she’s in the closet LOOK BEHIND YOU.
I don’t want to write a Thanksgiving-table diary, and I will never write one, but my portrayal of myself makes me sound like a victim, which I’m not. Yeah, I do feel sad and discontent sometimes, for a number of reasons, and that’s interesting to write about. But more often it’s my choice to spend a lot of time by myself, and I know that other people think that’s a bummer, so that’s the way I represent it. I don’t know how to shake Winesburg Katherine, but I just want to be as honest as possible. ♦

I know saying “I can’t wait for summer” is stating the obvious. I’m like the person who climbs the stairs and says, “I guess this is my exercise for the day”—something I hear/gag at too many times each day as I climb the stairs in my dorm. But honestly, I can’t wait for summer. The only interesting thing that’s happening in my classes is that I suspect one of my professors has the horn for a student. Their interactions are providing me with what my class discussions and slow social life don’t currently offer me: something interesting. Otherwise, school is a total drag. Here are the main reasons why:
1. My speech professor recently told me that since so many of my speeches have revolved around RuPaul, I can’t mention him anymore during presentations. He wants me to branch out more in my topics AS IF RuPaul isn’t one of the most important humans ever!!! What’s this professor’s damage!?
2. All the cute boys here are SUPER Christ-y. I’ve been taking cues from Samantha Jones and flirting with everyone, and I’m discovering that all my top cuties are real evangelical, which is a problem because it means that we have incompatible beliefs and because I don’t approve of foisting religion on others. Upon asking one dude what he does for fun, he started talking about Campus Crusade for Christ and, after asking me whether or not I was a Christian, tried to convince me to consider faith as an option and to come to a Wednesday meeting. These boys like talking about their callings, but I feel like they’re the type of straight dudes who may grow up to say things like: “My wife is always right, hyuck hyuck hyuck. When she asks me if she looks fat in her jeans, I always say no, hyuck hyuck hyuck. Men aren’t worthy of women, hyuck hyuck hyuck.” But then they will be super bad at genuinely loving the women they say are omnipotent and omniscient. This spring and summer will not likely yield any cute, Satan-loving boys, but the fall might, provided I am admitted to one of my transfer schools. (Thinking about that makes me nearly poop my pants in fear, which will maybe repel all the preachy boys.)
3. This past week, after taking my first puff of weed, I had a minor breakdown. I was convinced that I had somehow burned my throat and would have to ingest food and liquid through a tube for the rest of my life. I cried, walked rapidly all around our yard and house (to cool my throat off with a gentle breeze), and generally met any of my brother’s attempts to help me with hostility. Fifteen minutes later, after accepting a glass of milk and a cigarette, I apologized profusely and tearily. This prompted him to tell me: “You’re like a virus that enters someone’s body and is like, ‘Hi, uhh, sorry for being here, but I’m about to make you sick.’” Which he followed by saying, “But it’s fine. There are cool viruses.” My insecurity levels are out of control, and I need to work on not apologizing for my existence to everyone I talk to. However, I can’t progress with my personality until I get out of a place that gives me perma-bitchface, and until I rid myself of my anxiety over transferring and the fact that I feel stupid every day for coming here in the first place. ALSO, in order to get better at interacting with humans, you have to interact with humans, and I’m not doing too much of that currently.
You know that feeling you get when you’re sort of expecting a text from someone and keep on looking at your phone while you wait? I’m going to be feeling that until I not only get out of school, but hear back from the ones I applied to, which should be in the middle of May. Where is Carrie Bradshaw when you need her to rub your belly and tell you everything will be all right? (Answer: Shopping! Women, am I right? hyuck hyuck hyuck) ♦

When my brother and I drove away from the airport in Albany, New York, around 7 PM last Friday, we knew that we had a long trip ahead of us. It would take us approximately 16 hours to get to Nashville. We knew we would have to drive a fair distance that night if we didn’t want to hate ourselves the next day. We also knew that we weren’t that hungry, but that we would want to get dinner for later, when we would be hungry. What we didn’t know was that the food we were going to eat was going to ruin our lives and destroy our chances of finding love or fulfillment or even occasional inner peace.
We got burritos at the Chipotle in Albany because ADDICTION. (Also, hot Chipotle dude, consider this a MISSED CONNECTION from a HORNY TEEN. I was there. You were there. I looked at you. You talked to a co-worker. You went to the back of the restaurant and disappeared. Call me if ur interested ;) ) About an hour later, when we were hungry, we stopped to eat our dinners in the parking lot of a rest stop. Seats pushed back and in the reclining position, we ate every last bite of our giant burritos with gusto. 
Twenty minutes later, we couldn’t move. We couldn’t laugh or talk too much because laughing hurt and talking was loud. We didn’t even want to talk about being horny. This NEVER happens. A few more minutes, and the air started to feel oppressively heavy. “THIS IS FOOD?!?!?! THIS is what keeps us going?!?!?!” I cried. We started to laugh, but it hurt so much that we stopped and curled into little balls. A few more minutes, and we drove a few yards to get closer to the building and ran inside to the bathrooms.
I spent a long time pooping and texting Davis. I was involuntarily whimpering when a maintenance woman came through, prompting her to ask if I was OK. “I think I’ll be fine,” I moaned. “Could you maybe turn the music down, though?” She said that she was sorry, but she couldn’t. 
When I had been alone in the women’s bathroom for so long that the automatic lights had turned off, Davis came inside and went into the stall across from mine so that we could be miserable together. We talked about Britney Spears and the sickest we’d ever been and also swore off Chipotle. (Not that there was anything “wrong,” per se, with our food. I probably shouldn’t have eaten a whole giant burrito after a week of not eating very well at all.) We talked about how we were going to take better care of our own bodies and laughed when a Coldplay song came on.
We got to our hotel late that night. I came in hugging bottles of Gatorade, gingerale, and water, looking as pitiful as I felt. The next afternoon, we woke up, bought doughnuts for breakfast (whoops), and drove from noon Eastern Standard Time till 1AM Nashville time (12 hours total). In between, we flash-toured one of my prospective colleges, farted at each other, talked about crushes, talked about school, and went a little bit insane (I had a small breakdown at a gas station in Kentucky; Davis was exhausted and also kept threatening to murder me).
I don’t really think I learned anything from any of this, because learning things from experiences is not cool. I’ll probably take better care of my body, but only so much that I don’t experience anything similar to Chipotle-gate 2013. I also discovered that I am related to someone who will poop with me and snuggle with me in the same day, but I already suspected that. ♦

I finished Sex and the City last week. I’d been watching it since December, and not to be melodramatic or anything, but no piece of pop culture has torn me apart emotionally and built me back up again like this show has. It just, like, affirmed my sense that people are decent sometimes, and that human interaction isn’t always about getting yelled at by a student for spilling jelly all over the PB&J station in the cafeteria the first time you emerge from your dorm for a non-class-related purpose in a week.
(Major SATC spoilers ahead!)
I wasn’t at college or in my bedroom at home when I watched the last episodes—I was with Carrie. I was in New York with her when she decided to give up her column and move to Paris, and I was in Paris as she slowly realized that her home was in New York with Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte. I cried when Samantha called Carrie a cunt at their last New York meal together, sobbed when Carrie lost her nameplate necklace that she had bought with her friends years ago, and nearly drowned in my tears when Magda kissed Miranda on the forehead after Miranda bathed Steve’s ailing mother and said: “What you did—that is love. You love.”
There are so many scenes from this show that will stay in my mind and heart forever. Like when Carrie finds out that Samantha has breast cancer and grabs her hand at Miranda’s wedding during the “in sickness and in health” part of the vows. Or when Carrie makes a tearful phone call requesting to meet someone we think is Big at “the usual spot” and instead it turns out to be Miranda, with whom she had recently fought. Or when Carrie strokes Charlotte’s hair because Charlotte is upset about not being able to have a baby, or when Carrie thinks about something, or when she holds some random object, because Sarah Jessica Parker holds objects—a bar of soap, a card, a pack of cigarettes—in a way that destroys me. She has a gorgeousness that goes beyond physical beauty. 
Listen, I know it’s just a show. But before I saw the whole series, I was slowly losing interest in just about everything. I checked books out of the library and read 100 pages or less before returning them. I became bored during conversations with classmates. Food tasted like cardboard mid-chew. And I stopped writing things in my notebook every day. I don’t know if SATC has cured me of my funk, but it’s definitely halted its progress. Every time I don’t want to get out of bed to go to class or interact with humans, I can feel Carrie Bradshaw’s hands holding my face and her thumbs stroking my cheeks, and it feels more real than anything else. ♦

Saturday afternoon, I got a text from my dad saying that I got a letter from one of the colleges I applied to as a transfer. He asked if I wanted him to open it right then and there. After an internal debate that lasted longer than it would have taken me to drive over to the house, read the letter, steal some potato chips, and drive back, I said yes, then stared at my phone for an excruciatingly long five minutes. He finally texted me back: I had been accepted. I was so excited that I took a celebratory nap (suspense wears me out), then offered to buy my brother dinner. Later that night I brought some food to my parents’ house and told my brother the news. He screamed, ran around, and then tackled me.
SO, I got into a college and can transfer this fall (provided my final grades are good). The college I’m at now is a short drive from the house I grew up in. It feels more like an extra year of high school than like a whole new adventure or whatever college is supposed to be. It’s a conservative and vaguely Christian school; talking about anything the slightest bit risqué, even if it’s just sexual euphemisms in a poem, is frowned upon by faculty and students alike. And even though I was raised in the South, I’m having a hard time relating with most of these people, because all conversation and behavior down here is ruled by an obligation to be polite above anything else. Also, the school I go to now doesn’t offer or allow me to participate in a lot of extracurricular activities that I’m interested in; the new one does. I’m ready to be a real human who interacts with other humans outside of class again. But the thing I’m looking forward to most of all is not having to act like I’ve seen The Matrix. 
The freshman class at my school had to watch The Matrix in this class you’re required to take your first semester, but I missed the second half of the movie in order to sleep in. Since then I’ve willingly lied about having seen it to SO MANY of my instructors and peers. Basically everyone I talk to wants to talk about, or at least references in some way, The Matrix. Many of my teachers bring it up regularly in class discussions. I know it’s a popular movie, but, like, there are other movies. 
Anyway, I get to transfer this fall, and if I discover that everything around me is an illusion created by robots that took over the world and I have to spend the rest of my life playing video games in a spaceship (that’s as far as I got in the movie), I’m going to scream. ♦

It feels more like an extra year of high school than like a whole new adventure or whatever college is supposed to be. It’s a conservative and vaguely Christian school; talking about anything the slightest bit risqué, even if it’s just sexual euphemisms in a poem, is frowned upon by faculty and students alike. And even though I was raised in the South, I’m having a hard time relating with most of these people, because all conversation and behavior down here is ruled by an obligation to be polite above anything else. Also, the school I go to now doesn’t offer or allow me to participate in a lot of extracurricular activities that I’m interested in; the new one does. I’m ready to be a real human who interacts with other humans outside of class again. But the thing I’m looking forward to most of all is not having to act like I’ve seen The Matrix. 
The freshman class at my school had to watch The Matrix in this class you’re required to take your first semester, but I missed the second half of the movie in order to sleep in. Since then I’ve willingly lied about having seen it to SO MANY of my instructors and peers. Basically everyone I talk to wants to talk about, or at least references in some way, The Matrix. Many of my teachers bring it up regularly in class discussions. I know it’s a popular movie, but, like, there are other movies. 
Anyway, I get to transfer this fall, and if I discover that everything around me is an illusion created by robots that took over the world and I have to spend the rest of my life playing video games in a spaceship (that’s as far as I got in the movie), I’m going to scream. ♦

Between 2002 and 2009, whenever I would get sick, I used to sing BBMak’s “Out of My Heart” and think of Leonardo DiCaprio in Catch Me If You Can until I felt better. The two are totally unrelated, but I always thought the song played in the credits of the movie, because the lyrics are like, “Catch me if you can / I’ve gotta make a getawaaayyy.” Anyway, I forgot all about this, but the reason I bring it up is that I had the WORST poop of my life in the Hampton Inn in Hadley, Massachusetts, tonight, and I started to sing that song to myself in order to feel better. It worked in 2009 and it worked now. WTF? LOL! LIFE!
Aside from the fact that my body hates me, everything is fine. I’m in Massachusetts! On college tours! And there’s snow! It’s mostly piled up on the sides of roads and gray from dirt, but every time I see those snow banks I want to give them hugs and never let go. When I left my dorm for the trip I, like, giggled with excitement in the elevator. My ability to make conversation with other humans is lower than ever, but I’m on the road with my dad and there is snow everywhere, so it’s all OK. Like many dads, mine likes to read billboards as we pass them, which makes me die with LOLs and hearts. Also, when I’m on trips with him, I discover the part of me that likes to explain all future plans in detail—tour times, distances between schools and hotels, the order of things we need to do—and then describe them again and again. So, in conclusion, Leonardo DiCaprio and Y2K pop hits are my medicine, snow is everywhere, and I’m visiting the college Charlotte York went to tomorrow. Here’s hoping the only other thing we have in common is miraculously shiny hair. ♦

I was in upstate New York visiting schools and my brother this past weekend. The snowy landscape made me feel almost less solid, physically, yet my thoughts got heavier, like damp soil on an aging grave. So, in other words, I was still a mess.
Thursday night I went to dinner with my brother and his friend. When we got into the car, I felt like a joey crawling into a kangaroo’s pouch. Once I was snug, they hopped me away. They talked about how most of the kids at their college were probably on the social fringes in high school. That, along with the fact that his friend smelled like sugar cookies, comforted me. 
Friday morning I was alone in my brother’s dorm room with his roommate. I tried to reread East of Eden for school but couldn’t focus on the words that well. My eyes were moving over the page, but mostly I just looked out the window at the students and the snow. The roommate asked me what I was reading and I told him, and added that I hated it, except for the character named Cathy. Later, though, we were out getting dinner, and my brother was like, “You loved that book.” And I was like, “I don’t know. Sort of. Maybe not.” Maybe I liked it when I was 15, but maybe I just thought I liked it, and now I don’t know how I feel. All I know is that I like Cathy—the sweet-looking blonde who is really pure evil—but I remember very little else. Maybe I feel two ways and I didn’t lie to the roommate at all. 
That night, my brother held me for a long time. I was thinking about how I know what I know. So much of the information I have is misremembered fragments; so much of it will never connect. I want to see how one thing leads to another, but I usually can’t. It makes my throat feel tight. 
The next day, at the airport, this security guard was asking people on the security line random questions. “WHAT’S YOUR FAVORITE ICE CREAM FLAVOR?!?” he yelled. I felt my mouth open. “Uhhhhh. Weeeelllllll…I think…ugh…I don’t know, maybe…no. NO!” Even after I shouted at him, he kept on prompting me to tell him. I just stuttered until what was coming out of my mouth was incomprehensible. I walked away fuming. I can’t pin anything down without half-lying or otherwise getting flustered. I honestly don’t know what my favorite ice cream flavor is, and I don’t really care. I’m sick of having to say what I do or don’t like, because either I don’t know, or I do know and it’s complicated. ♦

I’ve been having a very Samantha Jones week, during which I’ve talked to everyone in this really horny voice, because guess what? I’m SUPER HORNY.
I think it’s residual horniness from being in New York in all of that snow (the cold makes me horny). So even though it’s already hot here, and I’m sweaty and don’t want to touch anyone in any way at all, I’m still like HEY BOYS WHAT’S UP?!?!?
I want to toss my virginity like a salad: quickly, casually, tastefully. And soon. Because it’s about to get really muggy in the South. That’s not a euphemism. Well, but maybe it is.
Virginity is not that big of a deal. I used to think that the difference between people who had and hadn’t had sex was the way Esther Greenwood described it in The Bell Jar—that people who had done it had something in their eyes that marked them as separate—but I know now that this isn’t true. I know because there was this couple in high school who lorded the fact that they were having sex over everyone as if they knew so much more about it, or as if everyone who hadn’t had sex thought they were doing something crazy and terrible. In reality I just thought it was healthy and normal, and nothing in their eyes signified a difference. There was no image of the other person suspended in their pupils.
Sex is not the only thing that’s been on my mind. In fact, the most important things to me right now are as follows: (1) getting accepted into one of the colleges I applied to so that I can transfer; (2) RuPaul; (3) Carrie Bradshaw’s happiness and fulfillment; and (4) getting over high school.
But I’m ready, you know, to “lose my innocence.” Also, it’s ridiculous that losing your virginity is referred to as a loss of innocence. Why do we have primarily negative terminology for something that is, like, totally not bad at all?
I’m going to keep on praying to Samantha Jones and making eyes at all the cute boys. ♦

The other day my literary theory teacher introduced us to the work of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. He wrote a lot about language and identity and would talk about “signifiers,” which are such a complicated thing that if you Google “Lacan signifiers” none of the top results really give you a straight answer. But from my very limited understanding it’s like there’s a thing—say, a butt—in the world, which Lacan calls the “signified” thing. Then there’s the word butt, which is the signifier—it communicates what the thing is (a butt is not an elbow or a pizza or a mouse, because it is a butt) but has no essential attachment to the thing (the butt) itself. We use signifiers to try to pin down what a thing is, but they are so arbitrary that they are always at risk of detaching themselves from what they signify and flying away. For example, where one person might hear the word butt and picture Leonardo DiCaprio’s naked angel butt, another person will picture a painting of a butt, and another a teacher’s butt in a pair of sagging khakis. 
In my class notes I wrote, “Our unconscious is a continuously circulating chain of signifiers with no anchor,” and also that “the process of becoming an adult is the process of trying to stabilize the chain of signifiers so that stable meaning becomes possible. You reach adulthood when you say ‘I’ and ‘I’ designates a specific set of signifiers you have adopted.” Meaning (I think?) that I can’t become an adult until I’m able to identify certain personality traits that I have, and use a set of words and symbols to let the world know “who I am.” 
All of this signifier stuff has created a little ball of sickness in my stomach (it’s probably helped by the fact that nothing I eat comes from nature). I know it’s my first year of college and I am therefore transitioning in many ways, but I feel like I can’t tie down any signifiers. Like, if you were in one class with me, the one where I’m the kid who sits in the back and scowls, and you walked into my next class that very same day, you would not recognize the person who is so talkative and tangent-y that the girls in the row behind her have asked her if she’s always high in class. Does this mean that I’m failing to mature into adulthood, because I’m not really tying down those signifiers? Or that identity is so complex that different signifiers are needed for each situation you find yourself in? Or maybe I just have no idea what I’m talking about.
Registration is approaching, so I had to create a schedule and meet with my advisor this week. I took one of his literature classes last semester and am signing up for another next semester. I am usually talkative in literature courses, but in his class, for some reason, I hardly ever spoke. If I did, my voice got really high and weepy-sounding, and I could only talk in fragments. I tried to tell my advisor that I was looking forward to his class and also that I was feeling more confident about participating in discussions, but I just got really choked up and had to leave. Maybe I should have just said, “Lacan,” and he would have nodded sagely at my explanation.
I’ve been working on transferring schools, and I’m nervous. I’ve turned in most of my applications, so there’s nothing more I can do. To try to rid myself of that helpless feeling, I’ve created a game called “Do everything perfectly all the time always no matter what.” It goes like this: If I mess up any mundane task, I tell myself that I have guaranteed I will get rejected from one of my schools. If I do something perfectly, my applications will still have a chance. I’ve been trying to make it into parking spots on my first try, match the color of my pencil with the color of the notebook I’m writing in, and flossing every night, making sure to go through each crevice twice with my mint floss, and basically trying not to barf everywhere. ♦

Being on campus outside of class is starting to make me very nervous. If I get to the cafeteria and it’s crowded, I immediately turn around and go back to my dorm to study. But I’m a human being who needs to eat, so I’ve started pretending that I’m the only person on earth when I go out. I try not to make eye contact with anyone, the better to deny their existence altogether.
Friday night, I went to see Amour. When I walked up to the theater’s doors, I wanted to run away. People were pressed together like slices of cheese separated by the thin wax paper of their clothing. But I pretended the lobby was empty and went inside. The result was that I saw a movie I liked. That was good.
But then the other day, as I was browsing in a clothing store, my illusion was shattered. I spotted someone I knew, and if they saw me they’d surely start TALKING at my FACE, and then I couldn’t deny that they were real, and standing right in front of me. Talking. I gasped and hid behind a wall, and then went to the register and bought everything I had in my hands—two shirts and a dress—so I could get out of there ASAP. Now I have to return them, but I’m afraid I’ll see someone else I know. That was bad.
I feel like a rodent trying to scavenge and go undetected. I went through a phase like this two years ago, and before that, when I was in elementary school. Generally, something would happen that would make me feel validated and I’d stop freaking out: I’d get a part in a play or have a teacher who thought I was funny. But that validation doesn’t last forever. 
There’s an episode of Sex and the City where Carrie is feeling down about being single. At the end of the episode, she gets over it. The last shot is of her sipping wine outside at a cafe. She has no buffer, like a book or a friend. She just stares at the people walking by and drinks her wine. That’s where I want to be. I just can’t tell if it’s where I’m headed. ♦

I just watched the Girls episode from last week—“One Man’s Trash”—and it was super super good as always, and in the middle of the episode, I had a breakthrough. 
In the episode, Hannah (the lead character, played by Lena Dunham) has sex with this dude she just met, and he tells her she’s beautiful and she’s like, “You really think so?” and he’s like, “Don’t you?” and she goes, “I do, it’s just not always the feedback that I’ve been given.” That last line was the one that jolted me. It was insta-empowering. 
I have made no secret in this diary about my love for Samantha Jones, who is a kind of role model to me in terms of doing whatever the hell you want without worrying about what anyone else thinks. She’s also the only main character on Sex and the City who doesn’t do this annoying thing where if someone says they’re sexy or beautiful they have to be all, “Who, ME, sexy??!” As if these women aren’t just constantly walking up to any man they find cute and winning them over in under a minute. They’re attractive, (usually) confident women with whom half of SATC’s version of New York wants to have sex. Their reactions remind me of how I usually respond to any compliment, even if I actually think I look fancy as hell/hawt/adorable that day. What Hannah did by admitting that she thinks of herself as beautiful was, as Phoebe put it later in our Super Not So Secret Rookie Staff Group on Facebook, “such an affront to being coy and self-deprecating.” 
A few years ago I was working as a camp counselor at an all-girls summer camp. On the penultimate night of camp, all the counselors decided to go skinny-dipping. So we all walked down to the lake and stripped down and jumped in. Fun. Neat. Great.
But then this one girl, my best friend at the camp, looked at my boobs and laughed. She started making fun of them and then everyone else laughed at them, too. One girl said they looked “like lopsided meringues.” 
I laughed along with them. Then, when everyone had moved on, I got out of the lake, picked up my towel, walked back to my cabin, and went to bed. I didn’t talk to anyone the next day except when I needed to.
And, for a while, I thought it was good that they had told me that I had two hideous meringue sprouts attached to my chest. I thought that I must have been stupid before and that they caught me before I had an unwarranted sense of confidence. 
The thing is, I think my boobs look really fucking awesome. Like lopsided meringues. And I recently let my armpit hair go wild because I wanted to see what it looked like. And it looks awesome with my meringue boobs. Around where I live, in the South, pit hair is not considered a “cool” way to look, but the instant I got my first sprouts of hair I was like DAMN THIS LOOKS GOOD.
I know that not everyone sees it that way. So when I’m around other people I still feel less than spectacular. But when I’m alone, I feel like a fucking queen. Although the feedback about my face or body has not been historically stellar, I don’t have to pretend like I don’t think I’m hot shit because of it. I don’t need other people to agree with me. I can feel that way all by myself. Maybe in a month, or two, or more, I can feel that way all the time. ♦

I went to the funeral of a family friend on Saturday. My grandmother was shaking at the service, and I couldn’t really do much except put my hand on her shoulder. 
Afterwards, we passed by my grandparents’ old house. It looked all wrong. When my brother and I used to visit them for the weekend, I would gape at the white columns as we drove up to it. As soon as I walked through the door, I would inhale as deeply and as frequently as I could. My mom now says the entryway smelled like gardening supplies, but she was recalling some other house, because the entryway I was in smelled like wine and fancy soap. Every time I went to the bathroom, I would sit on the sink counter and open my grandmother’s perfume bottles one by one, taking in each fragrance in turn. There were satin sheets on the beds, a marble statue in the dining room, and a hot tub on the porch. It was a palace.
Now the columns have been repainted a tan color, some of the greenery is gone, and I could see Magic Marker doodles taped to the window where the dining room used to be. It was like that scene in The Odyssey where Odysseus and Telemachus come home to Ithaca to find their home overrun by the suitors, except there were no asshole suitors, just the doodles and a white truck in the driveway. I wasn’t attack-them-and-win-Penelope mad, but I was indignant. What are these people doing here?
On the drive home, I made an interesting discovery. My dad’s name is Gordon, and every time we pass a Gordon Lane or Gordon Road, he raises his eyebrows, tap the windows, and says something about how famous he is. So this Saturday, as we passed Gordon Drive in Lebanon, Tennessee, where he used to live, I assumed he was just kidding when he said the street was named after him. But no. His grandfather had bought and developed land in the area, and asked my dad if he wanted a street named after him. Then BOOM. Gordon Drive. This is one of my favorite dad moments thus far. Nothing was as I thought this week. ♦

Ever since I watched some footage of Dick Proenneke two weeks ago, all I’ve been thinking about is escaping to the Alaskan wilderness and building a cabin there. I know that this is impossible for multiple reasons, the main one being that I have no cabin-building or survival skills. I would fail and die. Or get mauled by a bear. But I can’t stop fantasizing about being alone in the wilderness for an indefinite amount of time. I mean, that has basically been my college experience thus far, minus the beauty of the mountains and wildlife.
I just spent Christmas with my family. Everything was fine, except I kept on saying all the wrong things and drowning in self-loathing and now I don’t want to talk about it. My room has no lock, but if it did, no one would get in for another week at least. I’m mostly just hanging out here, letting my muscles atrophy and trying to find a cure for this rash that’s trying to take over my neck and destroying my dream of becoming a jewelry model for QVC. Sometimes at I recite “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” to myself when I go to bed. I guess it’s weird to recite a poem about rising when you are doing the opposite, but Innisfree for me is retreating to my room or sleeping.
Since I can’t escape to my own Alaskan wilderness or Innisfree, I’ll probably just turn down the heat and get a few logs for my room. Or maybe I’ll fill a bucket up with water and shake it a little every time I want to hear lake water lapping by the shore. ♦

Sunday I began to pack my things. Slowly, my bedroom transformed from a comfortable alcove into an empty, sterile space. Before I left for school, I lay on my bare bed and stared at the ceiling, dreading the short drive back. God, I’m such a brat.
When I walked into my dorm room, my roommate and her friends were sitting around and listening to “My Chick Bad.” They would shout-sing to really boring parts but remain silent when Ludacris sang my favorite lines: “All white top, all white belt / All white jeans, body looking like milk.” “LOSERS,” I shouted as I walked past. Just kidding. I said hey and walked to my corner of the room.
Later that night I went to get ice cream and see a movie with my brother. After the movie we stopped by my dorm so I could pick up some laundry. I took a break in my dorm room to cry sloppily, consumed with self-pity. But then, back at the car, my brother told me something that totally helped me get over myself. Hugging me, he gave me a reminder: “You have a fake ID now. You can be sassy and do stuff.” He also said something encouraging and wise about school, but the important thing was the fake ID.
This semester isn’t going to suck. I’m going to finish reapplying to colleges, work hard in my classes, and, most important, go out of my way to get wasted. Self-pity is stupid and no fun. Getting wasted is stupid and some fun. This semester of college could be some fun. Awesome! ♦

I really hate amusement parks. The bathrooms are disgusting, the rides make me sick, and something about seeing people in plush cartoon costumes makes me uneasy. I figure that’s how some people feel about the first week of school, which is my version of walking through the gates of Disney World and getting in line for Space Mountain.
School is the worst, but that first week when you have all new classes is AWESOME. You get to memorize a new schedule, read a bunch of syllabi, and buy all new supplies. Nothing gets me hot and bothered like color-coordinating my notebooks with my folders. PLUS, you get all new teachers and classmates. 
Most of my professors seem all right. I have one I can tell I’m NOT going to get along with, though. She’s just soooooo corny. She embellishes every joke with a wink, or mimes laughing by throwing her head back and moving her shoulders rapidly up and down. She puts everything in air quotes. “Feminism,” she will spit. “Gender theory,” ho ho, eye-roll. Also, when she found out that one of the students in our class is an exchange student, she started speaking much louder and asking excessively if he understood. The guy would respond with a polite “Yes, of course.”
Otherwise, everything is peaches and cream. Thursday was fun, I think. My Art History & Poetry class went to the museum to see a Carrie Mae Weems retrospective. I tried to stay sane as kids snickered at this one photo of Weems masturbating. (Like, sexually graphic things aren’t unfunny, but they’re not funny, either.) Or they would respond to everything the guide asked us with “I think it has to do with identity,” even when it totally didn’t. That was only a few students, though, and we were later allowed to roam about in order to write an ekphrasis for our first class assignment. That was nice.
I don’t usually spend nights at home, but I did this weekend, and partied pretty hard. I watched Top Chef in my parents’ bed with my brother and dad. Then my brother and I got ice cream and chilled outside. We talked about boys and whether or not it would be cute for a boy you were with to pee on you. The final verdict: yes, if you’re in the shower. (Also, it would be very cute/sexy if you and your lover peed yourself at the same time. Like, if you were snuggling and didn’t want to get up, and you both peed your pants.)
So I guess this was a pretty good week. It feels good to go from having nothing to do to having work again. ♦

HEYYY SQUIRRELS! HEY LADIEEESSS!!!! WAZZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPP?????????? Was your week totally wicked? Have you listened to Carly Rae Jepsen’s Kiss in its entirety? Were you wearing a sequined fedora, a tutu, or anything covered in glitter this past Friday night? Because if you were, there’s a chance that you were with me—at the Justin Bieber concert. (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) (;))
I had been looking forward to this momentous occasion for a week. I listened to his music nonstop every day and made out with my poster right before my brother and I left for the show. JK. But I did give it a little peck on my way out the door.
When we got there, there were SO MANY PEOPLE. Apprehensive-looking parents clutched their daughters’ hands as they made their way through the crowd, an ocean of tweenagers wearing anything with Justin Bieber’s face on it. Shout-out to all the ladies in the crowd wearing all purple (Justin’s favorite color, OBV).
This concert was somuchfun. Carly Rae Jepsen opened for him, and I died when she sang “This Kiss” and “Your Heart Is a Muscle.” These two girls got to go up and dance with her while she sang “Call Me Maybe,” and I got to seethe with jealousy. THEN, when I felt I could wait no longer, Justin came on stage. He didn’t really come on stage. He flew.
You guys, it was ridiculous. He descended in this harness attached to a giant pair of metal wings. The two girls sitting next to us, apparently veteran Bieber concertgoers, had warned us that everyone would lose their shit when he came out, but I was still unprepared for the craziness that is thousands of kids simultaneously expressing their sexual desire for Justin Bieber. They screamed, they jumped up and down, they shouted lyrics at the top of their lungs. Every time he showed a sliver of stomach, they screamed even louder. 
I have nothing valuable to say about what Bieber is to young people that Kitty Pryde has not already said, but I can tell you that it was fun/hilarious/my favorite thing that I have ever been lucky enough to see.
Also important was that after Bieber sang “Boyfriend” he placed one finger in front of his mouth and shushed the entire crowd. This took a minute, but when all was silent, he lowered his hand and asked us, “Who wants to be my baby?” And then everyone basically fainted. 
I’m going to be riding a Bieber-induced high for weeks. ♦

I’ve spent a good bit of my free time these past two weeks watching the first two seasons of Sex and the City. I knew I really liked the show, but it wasn’t until recently that I developed a deep spiritual connection with Carrie Bradshaw and Samantha Jones. Sarah Jessica Parker’s voice has a very comforting quality to it that makes me feel every good feeling at once, and I consider Samantha the patron saint of horniness. (Horniness is, BTW, one of my favorite things.) 
For every instance when a character says or does something terrible or regressive (and there are a lot of those), there’s at least one scene where Samantha says something incredible. She lectures Charlotte on the fluidity of sexuality. She masturbates in bed to the sound of a couple having sex in the apartment next door, while drinking wine and smoking weed. She seduces a doorman by showing up in nothing but a coat and lingerie, and then never speaks to him again. Her every line is life-changing. Occasionally, she slips up—I remember seeing an episode in a later season where, annoyed that a group of drag queens wake her up every night, she resorts to yelling at them and calling them “trannies.” But in general, I love Samantha, and am trying to channel her essence as much as possible.
Every time I watch the show, I feel like I’m a bottle of soda, and it shakes me up, leaving me bubbly. It’s fun to dissect each episode afterwards—and I would LOVE to form an SATC club where we meet weekly to watch episodes and then discuss them over cosmopolitans (Carrie’s favorite drink). We’d also have special days for brunch, and OBVIOUSLY we’d have a Samantha Jones holiday where we celebrate horniness and sleeping around while using super-sultry versions of our voices. ♦
