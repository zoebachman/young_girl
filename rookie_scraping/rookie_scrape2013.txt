I feel odd, but I am trying not to dwell on feeling odd. It might be that the rapid change of the past few months has finally caught up with me and I am processing it all. Part of me feels calm and grown up, and another part feels a growing sense of absolute terror. I am hoping this doesn’t last.
I am not really scared of any external thing, I am scared of feelings. I don’t like this heavy weight on my chest—I had gotten so used to not having it. It’s odd feeling so many feelings simultaneously. I feel odd. ♦

On Thursday we had an underwear dance party in the kitchen, then I spent the night in his bed. Late the next afternoon, though you could still consider it the morning after the night before, me and Becky shared our habitual cup of tea, momentarily ignoring the sticky floor and piles of rubbish. Then we curled up with a still-drunk Jay in his bed and laughed hysterically at nothing in particular—laughed into the air, made it vibrate, and cursed the sunset for making the day go dark before we were even ready for it.
Eventually I made a home of my own bed, watched Before Sunrise and admitted to myself how much I think like Céline, who asks, “Isn’t everything we’re doing in life a way to be loved a little more?” and wondered why it is admirable and brave for a man to embrace love but needy and desperate for a woman to. At half one in the morning I was joined by Erica, who gave me her knowing look and spoke to me in her reassuring voice and then sat by my side and listened to Christmas songs in the dark.
It’s strange to think how all our bedrooms are completely identical to begin with, but then transform to adapt to their inhabitants. I think about how much of myself I instill in my own objects and clothes and environment. I think about how much of myself I instill in my own subconscious and send into the vivid dreams I have every night. I read Freud and learn about repressed emotions and how they can manifest themselves in physical pain. I think of how I have tried and tried to plug my stomach and every feeling that dwells there with an imagined cork and how Thursday night was such a welcome release. But it wasn’t idealised; it felt totally normal to be in his bed.
A song came on the radio and I remembered that Angelface, Erica, and I had been singing it last time I saw him. As he was wondering aloud at how big his hands looked on my body, I said, “I sang this to you outside when you were so drunk you were sick!” Understandably, he didn’t remember. There was a patch of sunlight on the wall and he made a shadow dog with his hand. The light moved along our skin. 
When I can’t sleep I think of all the things that might be different if I had arrived a day earlier, or two days earlier, or three even. I imagine all the alternative universes, their ribbons of possibilities flowing side by side. In one of them, all my repressed feelings would be completely let loose. I wonder whether that would be a horribly damaging world, or one that made a lot more sense. 
When I told him my horoscope, Jay said, “The stars know what they are doing.” Hardly a day goes by that we don’t dance a little around the kitchen, and sometimes I feel, in those moments the most, that everything will be more than fine. ♦

I want answers to unanswerable questions. Why are things like this and why are things like that? Poetry and books and art provide company but no answers.
I am not sad, just confused. All I am sure of is how the most important thing in life is love? The fact that I can only end that sentence with a question mark means, of course, that I’m not sure. I don’t know about love between two people, at least not yet, but I do know love between friends has filled my heart with a warmth it has never really felt before. 
When last week my flatmates and I staged our own Christmas day together, I wondered whether I was the happiest I’d ever been in my life. We swapped Secret Santa presents, ate our Christmas dinner around the table, and watched films the rest of the day on mattresses we’d pulled into the kitchen. Then the fog came and it felt frosty for once, I went to a Christmas-carol service with my best friend, and I finally found some tinsel at Sainsbury’s. Then came another evening, another excuse to dance and drink, and I tried a shoulder stand on my bed and bent my thumb back so it became swollen, but I still went dancing and he came to my door at four o’clock in the morning and I squeezed his hand when I had a middle-of-the-night panic attack. “I am going to breathe with you,” he said.
It was warm and then it was cold. I remembered what Christmas felt like when I was a little girl. I was happy. I was definitely definitely happy.
Now I am home again, and my friends are spread across the country. Little spots of love, or something. ♦

While listening to Beyoncé’s new album the other day, I was suddenly compelled to grab my journal and rip out all the pages that chronicle my anxiety and depression and the horrible horrible feelings that I don’t want to remember. I shoved them all into one of my old journals, where they belong—in the past. Now, my journal begins when I moved to London for university, which is when I feel my life properly began. I have a life in London that is all my own, and I share it with whom I want. I don’t have anybody in my life there who doesn’t make me feel good about myself.
When I came home for Christmas and went back to the pub where I used to spend so many evenings, I felt how far I had moved on from that place and that crowd. For whatever reason, none of those people—people from my old school, my so-called friends—ever made me feel particularly happy or confident. There was one exception: my best friend. She still feels like my best friend deep down. She has a life or her own now, like me—last Friday I visited her in her new house-share, where she lives with a new kitten, a full-time job, and a double bed. She is someone I want to keep. 
In the same drawer that housed my old diary, I found a letter I had written to my ex-boyfriend the morning after he broke up with me but never sent. I ripped it to absolute shreds. I like to think the past me kept it in that drawer just so I could have this moment where I felt so strong that I could definitively throw away the things that kept me tied to the past and made me feel like crap. To show me that I could be the one with the power.
I can see now how unhappy I was all summer, and how unhappy I was with my then-boyfriend. If I had been braver, I would have been the one who ended it, but I was feeling so vulnerable, I didn’t want to lose anything or anyone. I felt like I hardly had anything to begin with. 
I also finally started taking antidepressants over the summer, something that had been on my mind a long time. I did it out of desperation—I felt like I had no other option. They make me so much more stable. Even more so than this time last year, when I wasn’t necessarily depressed, but my moods were volatile. These meds even me out.
I suppose this is quite a fitting diary entry for Christmas Day and the end of the year. I didn’t intend it that way, but gosh, I realise how much I have grown up. ♦

I am right in the centre of my family—Mum to my right, Dad to my left, one cat by the fire, the other with a chair all to himself. My brother is out playing football. I am writing this from home, a place which makes much more sense to my brain than anywhere else, sinking into the sofa whose sensation I forgot. 
The long journey home today was long, but only because I made a mistake and got a bus going in the wrong direction. I listened to Arctic Monkeys’ AM twice over before I eventually got to the right station. I was so relieved. I closed my eyes on the tube and let the Northern Line soothe me. I never panicked at any point—I only felt pleasantly tired. I suppose London doesn’t scare me anymore.
I am hardened. Coming home again, I felt larger—my formerly sprawling home now feels like a cottage, cozy and dim. The strip lights and bare windows of my student accommodation in London seem so harsh in comparison, and the vastness of the city makes me feel like an ant. I have grown used to savage London drivers. I am no longer intimidated by the maze of the Underground map. I can maintain a poker face when encountering people I still have confusing feelings for. The idea of coming back to Birmingham gave me energy. I see it as a holiday. I was getting overly tired in London.
But I do belong there. I already take for granted how easily I fit in at my university. In one way or another, I share interests with almost everyone I meet. I can sing and dance along to Grease and Beyoncé with my flatmates, and buy Arcade Fire tickets with my other friends. People don’t turn up their noses when I say I am off to a Feminist Society meeting. There is some sort of understanding between most people that I’ve never experienced before.
Even still, I was excited to come home and have hot baths and free food and soft furry cats to cuddle. I suppose I belong in both places, that I have two homes. ♦

I spent much of last week back at my parents’ house, and it gave me a new perspective on my lifelong love/hate relationship with my hometown. There is nothing wrong with Birmingham, I was just asking too much of it. That’s why I had to move somewhere larger, with more to offer: More shops full of old clothes—like Brick Lane, where I got the best fleece-lined denim jacket the other day. More museums and art galleries, where there is constantly something intriguing to see. Every musician and band I love is almost guaranteed to come to London, and when they do, it will take nothing more than a short ride on the tube to see them. In comparison with all this, my hometown is severely lacking.
Being home feels so different now. Because I no longer feel trapped there, I can tell the things I love that I love them. Last week the huge park by my house, in which I have walked countless times, was properly autumnal, all fiery leaves on the trees and on the ground, damp earth, and misty breath. I went for walks in the dark evenings (there’s always light in London) and had bubble baths every day and the sky was actually clear and the streets were marginally quiet and everything was exactly where it had been before but I could feel distant enough to appreciate it all. 
I wasn’t my usual neurotic self; I felt more like a floater, belonging in two places at once—or belonging nowhere, feeling obligated to no specific place. Since neither place is my only home, I don’t need either of them to be my everything. I no longer demand perfection from any one town. And anyway, each place achieves its own perfection on its own, without me hanging around trying to make something out of what sometimes can feel like nothing.
I wasn’t feeling sentimental during this visit; I had no desire to visit my old haunts like a ghost. My memories didn’t capture me, because I have a present now and am not pining over the past. London has enabled me to be the person that I feel I am meant to be, while I still hold within me, at my core, a sense of my hometown. ♦

In my creative writing seminar, we did an exercise where we sat back, listened to a a Miles Davis song and observed what emotions and/or thoughts came to mind in that empty space. At first I imagined I was sitting in a smoky bar, where I could feel regret and heartache in the leather seats. A name, a face came to mind: a boy. 
Next, we were supposed to write a fictional scene based on whatever we had been feeling during the song. I wrote:
I don’t want the heartache to be about the boy. Because it’s never about the boy. It’s about our own selves. We either chose to share something with another person, or we chose not to. Yes, their face is always there. But it’s only a symbol. We search for ourselves through other people and through love. We beg for honest opinions, but only if they are complimentary. If they are not, the game doesn’t work. It fails. It’s over. And it’s always over before it begins.
Two days before this I had seen Arcade Fire live at the Roundhouse and it was magical and glittery and at one point a man I just met put me on his shoulders and I was at the same level as Win and the band, floating above everyone’s heads and my legs were like jelly when I reached the ground. On their new album there’s a song that goes, “Seems like a big deal now, but you will get over. Seems so important now, but you will get over. And when you get over and when you get older, you will discover that it’s never over.”
Maybe Miles Davis just brings out my angsty romantic side. Technically, I am over the boy. I know it’s not right to be “with” him, specifically. But I wonder if he could be replaced by anyone in the world and I would feel the same confusion. Or would I?
On Saturday I met a lawyer-in-training in a leather jacket and kissed him on the dance floor, in clear view of everyone. But HE is still there and he still exists, even though I will never feel the feeling I used to have when our bodies were close together. Now they are just two bodies. What used to be dissolves like mist. Or sometimes—and this is the worst thing—it feels like it was never there at all.
It would be so simple to forget him if we didn’t live in such close proximity. He’s a constant temptation, like a carrot being ever dangled before my eyes. He’s the type of guy I always thought about but never thought I’d have a chance with. A few weeks ago I couldn’t stand to be in the same room as him. Now I can sit comfortably and smile and laugh as though it doesn’t hurt, but it all feels painfully personal. 
Though it was over too soon, it’s never really over. I’ll keep holding on to the strings of every private, seemingly meaningful connection I’ve ever had with anyone. For me, there is no full stop. ♦

I can only recognize my own happiness in hindsight. I never say “I am happy,” only “I was happy.” So any joy I experience is never recorded in real time, for fear of jinxing it. The happiest condition I can write in is contentedness, a state too neutral to feel precarious. 
It’s been a long time since I felt that kind of peaceful neutrality. Back then I would summarize each day in a small spiral diary. I have started doing this again, in a larger journal that says Goldsmith University of London on the front cover. I record all the little details that add up to things I don’t want to forget. I want to capture the essences of even the smallest events and happenings that make me feel good.
Short sentences are enough to trigger vivid memories. Friday was simply: Went to Brick Lane by self and bought brown leather backpack, chip feast, Amersham with totally fucked Angelface. Reading that now, I can feel the brisk air and smell the train and think of all the faces I saw that day and remember shouting at the full moon with Angelface.
I wish I could record every conversation, every laugh. I want to hold on to the moments when me and Jay spontaneously create a dance routine to a Beyoncé song, or me and Erica fall on the floor laughing when she tries to use her key for my flat door (which I concede will only ever be funny to us). If people could read the record of these moments strung together, they would stop saying that college freshman do nothing but get drunk and sleep. They would see the profundity of every micro-interaction that goes into creating a proper friendship. Living in the microcosm of university only intensifies all these dynamics. We live under a magnifying glass.
Erica and I have inadvertently become best pals with the maintenance guys. They walk up and down the blocks of flats throughout the day and, when they catch one of us alone, ask, “Where’s your partner in crime?” One of them loves to give us advice. He urges us to wear a coat and tell our family we love them, because “you never know when they might get hit by a bus.”
A couple weeks ago, I had a dream in which old faces, people I knew from college (how was that only a year ago?), appeared in my university bedroom. All the old feelings of alienation and of not being “cool” or experienced enough coiled through my dream bones. I could feel so strongly that self-consciousness I almost always used to have. I used to have to blast my iPod to muster enough fake courage to walk past all the windows of my college building. I don’t have that now. I feel accepted. I have the privilege of feeling comfortable. We are all on a level playing field here—most of the early cliques have disbanded, and the ones that haven’t, I don’t feel I am missing out on. I have plenty enough without them.
Next year we will all have to leave the dormitories and move into houses. I am already thinking about how strange and sad it will be not to live here, even though that is months away. The dynamic we have formed here will be broken up into a bunch of smaller ones.
We will never live like this again. I may yet take back some portion of my fondness for it—there are still many more long winter months to come. But I don’t feel the cold so much right now and the early evenings, though a bore, aren’t quite as suffocating as usual. ♦

My boyfriend split up with me on Monday. I don’t feel heartbroken anymore, but I have experienced a little loss of confidence. Thursday I gathered my regrets and reflections on our relationship and then let them go. Friday my eyes were drawn to the held hands and affectionate gestures of complete strangers, but I had only fleeting pangs of melancholy. Saturday I stumbled upon some photos of us together over the summer, and it felt like I was looking at just one chapter in my life, one that was now quite suddenly closed. Those pictures represented then: a self-contained period with good and bad bits. I was not in a good state of mind the majority of the time, and having experienced my first serious relationship, I am really not in a hurry to repeat the process.
Now is an opportunity to start fresh. Now, I am looking out my London window at the London sky, hearing the rattling of London train commuters below. I can see the Shard and Canary Wharf from my bedroom, all lit up at night. I’ve met people I never knew existed before last week, I’ve cried on the phone to my mum, and I’ve laughed in hysterics in halls kitchens. Already I feel like I’ve experienced so many things that make me feel much more like a whole person than trying to please a guy ever did.
I’ve gone through a tumult of emotions in the past week, so many up and down periods that they’ve basically cancelled each other out. I don’t feel stronger or weaker, I don’t feel old or young—perhaps I don’t know how I feel. And that feels OK. ♦

“Come and lie down, the floor is actually really comfy.” 
The carpet is blue and speckled and IS surprisingly comfy, I think, as I lay my head on Erica’s* shoulder and rest my eyes. The volume of the music playing in the apartment rises and falls with every swing of the kitchen door. Two people we’ve never met before tonight lie down on the floor with us. Erica is my little bit of comfort in the dark world of London, and I am always glad she is near when I’m pretending to feel grown-up.
“Naomi, you are so fabulous.”
“Thank you, Jay.” 
Jay, my main dancing partner for the impromptu party in our kitchen, scoots around us in his tie-dye T-shirt. We borrow my friend Angelface’s boombox, truly a sight to behold—it’s cylinder shaped, black and red, and is without a doubt the best sound system on the block from an aesthetic point of view. I suspect Angelface is the one who gave me the cold I wake up with on Sunday, probably from time spent in his room singing Smiths songs while he played guitar. 
I get really hot so I tie my hair back, open the windows as wide as they will go, take my tights off, and throw them at someone’s head. Just when I think I am finished for the night, I put on “Wuthering Heights” and perform my party trick of knowing Kate Bush’s dance by heart. 
Colds make me emotional. In the evening I talk to my friend on the phone under my duvet. I think I need to write down all the advice she gives me and read it again and again. I miss my best friend from home. ♦

At university, something happens pretty much every day. I am glad. But it usually takes just 24 hours for it to lose its importance because something else has happened. Uni is permanent distraction.
I sometimes miss spending entire days in my head, having the space to think about nothing—and therefore everything. I try in vain to get back to that zone whenever I’m sitting outside by myself. I used to enjoy the sounds of London trains going past every few minutes and the children at playtime in the primary school next to my dormitory, but now I don’t even notice them—they’re just noise. 
We’ve been living on campus for just three weeks, but already our lives are so intimately entangled. By far the most complicated thing to manage is everyone’s romantic lives. It all feels very futile and confusing, but maybe living like this is a kind of jump-start on life. Things begin and end very quickly and we doubt there will be happy endings all around. ♦
Naomi
In my first few days of living in London, I explained my situation to everyone: My boyfriend had just broken up with me and I was not capable of thinking about anyone in an even slightly romantic way. I couldn’t imagine crossing the border into more-than-friends territory, not even for a harmless crush. That all changed the moment a certain guy drunkenly whispered an attempt at a Brummie accent in my ear. 
It was fun to crush again. My friend Angelface would shout, “I LOVE YOU!” out of the kitchen window when this guy was outside having a smoke. Luckily, I don’t think he ever noticed. I timed my entrances and exits just right in order to bump into him when he came back from music practice with his bass guitar on his back. Then one night as he was leaving the dormitory, I said goodnight and he asked me to wait up for him. We stood by the front door and he asked for my number, and that simple request made me giddy as a child. 
The next week after a group of us had gone to the pub, I was properly alone for the first time with said guy. We walked up residential hills in the dark to get to a park near campus that gives a sweeping view of London. Amongst the silver remnants of modern buildings and the cold blue of the London Eye, you can see Big Ben if you look hard enough. We sat on the wet grass for a while, talking a lot. There was static between us, the kind where you know what is coming but you don’t know when. Then it happened: He kissed me. On the way back, we sat on a mattress someone left on the pavement and looked at the one star we could see through the leaves, hanging in the smoggy London sky. 
After that the nights seemed starrier and the lights of London brighter. I don’t know why, but his smell was like a tonic. It’s annoying that a boy’s attentions have the power to imbue me with a sense of confidence and security. I loved talking to him. We both stressed that we didn’t want relationships, having both just left ones behind. But alas, it was still too much for him. Perhaps I fall too quickly. I didn’t want a relationship, but I wanted a piece of him for myself. 
He was attentive when we were together—we listened to the radio and talked about politics, and he tolerated my feminist rants so wonderfully (and even said he enjoyed them). One time we danced to Madonna in my bedroom while eating pain au chocolat. I always imagined doing little things like that with a boy, but I never thought they would actually happen. Maybe something that pleasant can only ever be fleeting. I took him to bed when he was sick and he told me I was “a beautiful woman”—the first time I can remember being called a woman by a person my own age. 
He said he wanted to be properly alone for a while. I also had doubts that a relationship was what I wanted. I certainly didn’t want the constant texting/messaging, letting the other person know what you are doing, the arranging of things—but it still hurts. I don’t want a boyfriend, but I want someone for my own. It’s selfish. I think I made the mistake of thinking I knew what I really wanted, but I can see now that I still have a lot to learn. ♦

This morning a storm battered southern England. The leaves that me and Erica worried would never fall are mostly on the ground. I feel a bit battered, too. Life is very relentless and I have a long to-do list every single day. 
In the summer, I had to be constantly looked after. There were periods when I spent most of my days in bed and Mum had to hold my hand. I became a little homesick on Friday, I suppose because of a thought that bobs to the surface: There is no one here, away from home, to look after me. To wash up after me and buy me food, to make sure there is always milk in the fridge. That’s what I am learning about—looking after myself. The novelty of London has worn off. I feel like I live here now, that it is not just a holiday, because of the mundane chores that never stop having to be done.
After writing this, I need to go to my doctor’s appointment, an appointment I made myself. Shamefully, I’d never done that before. I have to make sure I get there, I have to ask for a repeat prescription, I have to find a pharmacy, pick up and pay for that prescription. It’s such an ordinary thing, really, but it will mean so much if I can do it. ♦

The end of summer is the only bit of summer I like. As much as I enjoy having nothing to do (I don’t enjoy it), autumn means productivity, and if there is anything I have learnt about myself over the past year, it’s that I love being productive. I may feel stressed out by education, but it gives me a purpose. Working towards something—anything!—makes me happy.
Getting ready for university has only meant little things so far, like changing my bank account to a student one and signing forms for student finance. Mostly money matters, which I am not skilled in at all. I’ve tried making lists, but I am not good at making lists—I write down three things at most and then my mind goes blank, and three things does not constitute a proper list. For miscellaneous objects to take to uni, so far I have: coat hangers, towels, hot water bottle.
But the soul-enriching things I want to do in London are easy to list in swaths and swaths. All the museum exhibitions and all the paintings and all the old shops and cafés and all the train journeys and the pubs and the gigs and all that beautiful stuff that I can’t put into words. There is nowhere I would rather be going. 
Despite all that, some parts of preparing to leave aren’t so sweet. My boyfriend and I were slowly waking up one morning to a lit room, and though his pure-blue eyes looked crazy beautiful framed by pink skin and white sheets, my eyes were pulled to the spine of a book over his shoulder, shouting “LONDON” at me as a cruel reminder that me and him will be two hours away from each other. I’ll be two hours away from home, from family, from the cats, from some of my precious friends—but somehow it seems farther in relation to him.
And though this summer has been mostly throwaway—wasted on some latent anxiety and depression that rose to the surface—I have pieces of nice memories: helium balloons my brother took for me from a party that he worked at and tied to the end of my bed, a letter one of my best friends wrote to me, a crystal Caitlin bought for me from the museum, a piece of the Berlin wall from my boyfriend, and marbled knickers that mark my first-ever attempt at tie-dye. 
Sometimes I have a little panicked realisation when I notice something little—like my cat running across the lawn—that I really will be leaving all this and all the little things and I miss it even while I am still here. The best reassurance is how often I’ll be able to come home and how I hope it will be the perfect compromise. ♦

Anxiety makes me feel like a child again. The increased activity I have been capable of lately brings with it increased anxiety and a sense of doom that follows me like a dark cloud. I feel very small sometimes, and completely defenseless.
I managed to go out this week, but I left the pub early and felt sad. I felt like there was some kind of barrier between me, every bustling person on the street, and the rest of the world. I felt out of place and out of my depth. My boyfriend walked me home and asked what anxiety felt like. I didn’t tell him that at the moment all I felt like doing was throwing up.
I went from crying in bed to a busy social scene within not much time, though, and I consider that progress. ♦

Rainy days remind me of the time when I took my first and only piano exam. It was a proper rainy day. Me and mum had to wait in a strange building with creepy corridors and cold floors. I must have had nerves for the exam, and the unfamiliarity of the place gave me an uneasiness, the walls giving off that slight static of unreality I feel sometimes when weather and circumstance conspire to numb the part of my brain that makes sense of things. I can’t even remember what this building, awkward and strange as it felt, was normally used for—except there was an organ in one room, so it must have been a place of worship of some sort. In any case, my nerves didn’t stop me anyway—I got grade 1* distinction in piano.
I have a sore throat and a new haircut. In two weeks I’ll be in London. The temperature will be a few degrees higher down south, a different climate almost. I don’t really care about goodbyes. My brain has moments when it seems to process this impending change, but I wonder if it is better not to think about it and just do it. My nerves don’t need to stop me, and I can get a grade 1 distinction in LIVING LIFE. I hope.

I am not writing as much as I usually do—putting words on paper used to make my feelings real and tangible, as if I was having a conversation with myself, but I’m reluctant to confide in myself lately. I don’t want to feel too deeply right now, and I don’t want to indulge in certain feelings. Sometimes it feels like I am lying to myself, or ignoring parts of myself. But I want to skim through life events like water over a smooth stone.
I can be a terribly serious person sometimes, though I pretend not to be. I also think too much, but that often leads me to seeing things and making connections I wouldn’t have made otherwise. And that fulfills me in a different way than being a laid-back person would fulfill me, but it can also hold me back. 
One thing I can’t stop thinking about from this week was talking to my friend on the phone before we went out. I started panicking, and he told me to “just get ready and step out the front door.” This made me realise how simple that is for other people. My mind goes over every little detail and worry, tries to suss out every escape plan, every eventuality. My brain kind of drives me mad.
I’ve started reading Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway, which says that at the root of every fear is the idea that we can’t handle something. I’m trying to change my way of thinking.

I’m hoping this will help me glide over the surface of life like other people do. ♦

Last winter, there was a Saturday night when I was working on an essay and my college roommate and her friends swept me away to go get dinner and hang out with them. At dinner they asked one girl they had been friends with since August what she liked to do. “I’m not sure,” she said. “I’ve thought about being into photography before, so who knows?” They all seemed to agree that photography was her kind of thing. 
Later, we ended up in someone’s dorm room, where three of us (including me) settled on a bed while another two sat on a table next to the bed. There was a girl on the floor working on an art project. Photography Girl opened up her friend’s computer, got on Netflix, and started talking about shows we might watch. “What about Louie? Do people watch that? Do you think it would be good? What is it, a drama? Comedy? Oh yeah, it’s, like, comedy. What’s it about?” She hadn’t asked me specifically, and the show is not something I’ve ever been interested in, but I explained the premise to her. “Okayyy,” she said before continuing to just like shout out names of shows. “Weeds? NO—American Horror Story?? ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT? DO WE DO THAT? IS FRIENDS FUNNY? IS IT TOO LATE TO WATCH FAMILY GUY? BOYS I KNOW LIKE THAT.” 
All the other girls looked at one another for a minute with scrunched faces before agreeing that they didn’t want to get into a series that night. They decided to search for a movie. “Oooh, movie night,” one girl said. I stopped talking altogether and got under a knitted blanket because I was cold. It felt a bit too intimate in that context, but I was pretending I wasn’t there so that I could stay calm until I had an opportunity to leave.
“What is it, then? Horror? Drama? Comedy?” They continued to flail. You know when fish put rocks in their mouths and then frantically spit them out? That was what was happening.
“ANIME,” the girl on the carpet said, leaning towards us. The group ignored her and decided to go with Louie after all. It’s not even like they made a decision to watch it; it’s more like the show just started playing. They paid a minimal amount of attention to what was happening onscreen and started talking about how they might want to go to a party or to a club. “Are there even parties happening? Should we go to that club? Where was it that we went last week? How much was cover, again? Do we still have alcohol? Do you think we can get more? Maybe we should just go to X’s house, but I think he has friends over. You know what? His friends will probably just be chill and, like, doing weed. Maybe we should do that.” After two episodes of Louie had played all but unnoticed, they decided they would go to their friend’s dorm and maybe smoke weed, then take it from there.
They invited me but I said I had an essay to write, which I did, and I got away. As I wiggled out of the bed, they talked about how they didn’t like Louie. “I don’t know, American Horror Story seems more us.” 
I keep on revisiting this night, each time with greater anxiety. The scene in the dorm room was especially haunting. It was like these people—friends and acquaintances—had no way of discerning their likes or dislikes, no inner compass with which to navigate entertainment or culture or information. Everything with them was vague and noncommittal. They liked going to clubs and doing karaoke, but beyond that they had no apparent interests. They were thinking about being into photography, felt like they could do something athletic, or were considering learning a John Mayer song on the guitar. They would do none of these things, because they didn’t have a camera or time for a sport or a guitar. They seemed at that moment like air particles, with no actual opinions to give anything they said or did weight or mass or gravity. 
While I, unlike my ex-roommate and her friends, have actual legitimate interests (I’m into dance, theater, writing—see?), I still went to a college I knew I’d hate because I had no clue what I was doing when I was looking at schools and I did nothing to give myself one. Being around those girls brought out my anxiety about the air-particle-person choices I’ve made, and the ways in which I am like them makes me feel sick. I feel sick because I went to the same college as them and didn’t do anything I used to enjoy and spent a lot of time on the floor of my dorm room with the lights off, too afraid to go to class or go out to get food when I was hungry. I felt disconnected and like everything else was disconnected too, and I thought a lot about how scary that was and I tried really hard to make things connect in my head, even though I knew deep down that you can’t force connections. I got mostly A’s but I got a B in speech. Several professors told me that I was “exceptional” or going to be a “real writer.” One told me I was “one of those brilliant students who come along every few years,” which felt like shit because it was so clearly false. I am not brilliant; I am nearly air. 
I want to vomit. ♦

It’s always warm and sticky in the doctor’s waiting room. I’ve become used to it, used to the drabness and the way the walls and seats and floor look kind of washed out. Even the obligatory fish in their tank looked a bit bored and grey. Sitting here is not overstimulating, and I appreciate that. Everyone sits still and silent, in as unoffending a manner as possible. I wonder if they are thinking about what the rest of us are here for. I wonder if they are wondering about me. 
I’ve started taking very long walks again. I only really do that in times of trouble, otherwise my heart isn’t in it. I do it because I feel a comfort and safety in circling familiar roads that I don’t get from “going out” or even staying at home. I am autonomous—I alone decide whether to walk further or turn back home. I am in complete control. I can let my thoughts float while I focus on the beat of my feet on concrete. I am physically moving forward, not trapped inside four walls.
Moving forward is all I ever want to do—to get better, to get stronger, to become more me. Being ill was easier when I didn’t feel like I was rapidly running out of time to get better and get stronger and prove things to people. I thought I was on an upward trajectory, but I’ve lost control. So much time has been spent in bed or waiting in a doctor’s office or walking the same old paths. ♦

I was accepted into my top-choice university. Now it all becomes real. I am equal parts scared and excited. I wish I weren’t in the mindspace I find myself in now, where I am anxious every single day. It’s very very hard to get out of, and it is no fun. 
I am trying to work my way through it, but maybe all my trying is wrong. Maybe I just have to be patient and not push it too hard. But I have a deadline: School starts in a month. I will have to move out of my home, the place I grew up and the comfiest and safest place that exists for me. 
At the same time, I cannot face the thought of staying here another year. I’ve wanted to leave this place forever, so I can’t waste this chance to get out. This is surely the way it was meant to be. ♦
Naomi
Part of my insecurity is that on the surface I can accept a compliment, but I never believe it. I don’t think any of my achievements are REAL. Things like good exam results, going out with confidence, and having days without anxiety are things I SHOULD be doing. They are things that most people just do without thinking about it. Why should I congratulate myself for doing them? In the context of my personal history I have small victories almost every day. I mean, spending the whole day in bed is an achievement sometimes!
I have really high expectations of myself, which is often self-defeating because it makes me fear failure so much that I don’t even try. I sometimes think, I won’t go out today because I might have a panic attack or feel anxious, and that isn’t normal, which means I will have failed, and then there will have been no point to going out. These kinds of thoughts stop me from doing things that I really want to do, and they give me more ammunition with which to beat myself up. Maybe my high expectations come from desperately wanting to be normal—I am constantly comparing myself with people around me and feeling that I should be more fun, more outgoing, more daring, go out more, be more independent, be less worrisome. Perhaps I just have to accept I am none of these things.
Can’t I accept myself with all the things I don’t and can’t do? Can’t they become parts of my character, rather than reminders of what I am lacking? I always focus on what I think is wrong with me instead of seeing the big picture. I should be embracing myself all the time, 24 hours a day, even when I am feeling sick and sad in bed. ♦

The white against green and the steady tick-tock of ball against racquet strings at Wimbledon is very calming for me this time of year. It’s the most pleasant background static there is. I like the precision and skill, the neat boxes and the ball bouncing right on the line. I like watching the tennis players’ lightning-fast reactions to a ball’s trajectory from the moment it leaves their opponent’s racquet, especially when they instinctively reach for the return even though their eyes can see that the ball is going to falter and hit the net. They perform like highly trained animals and I find them fascinating to watch.
I asked my boyfriend if I should write about Wimbledon for my diary this week, and he said, “Nah, no one wants to read about tennis.” I suppose he is right, it is kind of pointless if you don’t like or watch tennis. Thank you for indulging me.
It might be because I started the pill recently and my hormones have been affected, but I have teared up quite easily the last few weeks. I don’t mind it—in fact I think I like it. I used to never be able to cry, even when I felt the most intense frustration. Instead of letting it out, I tightened up around it.
I learned to quash my emotions at school. I remember crying within those walls only once, dripping hot tears into the keys of my computer during a German lesson because my workload was stressing me out. I never felt stable or safe at school, and never found solid friends. It made me close up so much. Stoicism became second nature, and it is a hard habit to break. 
I still harden myself to friends and acquaintances, even ones I have known for years. I doubt I could cry in front of the majority of my friends even if I wanted to. Being in a relationship, though, I have learned to soften. I’ve already cried twice in front of my boyfriend in the two weeks we’ve been together, and for me that is a lot. This is a new kind of intimacy for me. ♦

In the last few months there have been a couple times when I have considered submitting my resignation from the weekly diaries here on Rookie. I’ve had an irrational urge to quit something that is important to me just because I’ve recently been told that there are a significant number of people I know (but I am not close to) who read my diary regularly.
I don’t have a problem with acquaintances’ reading what I’ve written here per se—but I worry about their motives. I wonder whether they read it out of genuine interest or, since they because they may gain a tidbit of information or meagre gossip about me or about anyone I might mention here. I can’t stand the idea of having to face people without knowing what they may have read, what they know. I don’t really want my private thoughts to preempt my interactions with people. When you meet someone new, it naturally takes a while for you to choose to tell them certain things. But here, they can learn so much that I haven’t willingly and specifically offered up to them. What they know is out of my control. It’s not the most convenient way to socialize.
The words I write here mean something to me, of course, but they are also separate from me. I don’t wish to be judged on just this diary, for it is quite hard to express all aspects of my personality in a few hundred words a week. But it can’t not be a significant part of me: When I look back over past diaries, the memories they evoke amaze me. I’ve had the sweetest messages from strangers telling me what a relief it is to have someone to relate to, especially regarding feelings of anxiety. But there are certain people in my living zone that I don’t want privy to the emotions that I try to be so honest about in this space. There are people who don’t deserve that kind of access. But what can I do? Having no control over who can access bits of my past is the very nature of the internet and of having one’s work published—so I tell myself over and over again.
The reason I started writing was to avoid feeling like this, worrying about people’s interpretation of me. Writing is for me, a way to make sense of my feelings. I never feel so coherent or confident as when I write my thoughts down on a page. It’s always been the most comfortable mode of expression for me, something I don’t have to think too hard about. Now it has become uncomfortable because I am struck with paranoia every week as I sit down to write. I can’t help thinking now about who might be reading this. My social spheres are starting to merge, and that has caused me some anxiety. I worry about revealing too much, about being laughed at—every insecurity batters me in the face. I don’t believe that anyone is reading this with malicious intent, but all those eyes have turned what used to be the safest place for me into yet another place where I worry. 
Perhaps none of this would bother me if I had higher self-esteem. I can’t bear the thought of rereading some of my recent diaries, so the thought of someone else seeing them, and judging me for them, makes me cringe. I am not sure whether this is a warranted reaction or whether I should accept that once your work is published, who reads it and what they come away with is completely beyond your control.
Caitlin and I met last week. That was a much more successful merging of my Rookie world and the “real life” that tends to be much harder for me (though I pretend it isn’t). Caitlin is the first Rookie person I have seen in the flesh, and spending time with her helped this virtual world feel much more tangible. I felt like I’d known her for years. There was never any of that difficult beginning stuff with new friendships, because our mutual understanding had already been established. She is a gem. I felt I was with my kin—someone who truly understands and can share so many of my experiences.
That is what the whole of Rookie often feels like to me. I was 16 when Rookie was born, and it was a really shit time in my life. Writing for the site was the light at the end of the tunnel. I don’t think outsiders realise how close the Rookie staff are—they have collectively helped me enormously in developing and growing up. I hate to imagine the person I’d be without them and without Rookie and without being part of Rookie. And that still outweighs everything else. ♦

On vacation, my family had dinner with my grandmother’s friend. At the end of the evening, he told my grandma that I was pretty but that he wished I would smile more. My family thinks I got flustered because I was embarrassed by the compliment, but I was really angry at his wanting me to smile more. I don’t care about the compliment. At a party later in the week, the same man told me that he thought I could use a little more sun. Ugggghhhhh.
After we got home from our trip, my brother told me that he had talked with my uncle, who’d said, “Katherine’s a pretty girl and all, but she looks inactive.” Davis proceeded to tell me that I was looking a little bigger than usual and that I should try “walking it off.”
Now it’s Sunday night and Davis says I need sun. My mom agrees. “You need like 15 minutes of sun a day to get your vitamin D,” she says. I tell them that I’ve been going outside and lying in the sun from about 5:30 AM until as late as 8. They press further. This isn’t about vitamin D; this is about how I look and their wanting the right to comment on it frequently. 
Later in the night, I bring up people always commenting on me gaining weight and how pale I am. “No one even thinks about how you look that much,” Davis says. “Getting sun is just an easy way for you to feel sexier.” I scoff. He doesn’t get it. This isn’t about how I look right now; this is about people commenting on how I look and thinking what they say should matter to me. It doesn’t matter at all. ♦

Sunday night I was hanging out at home with my brother, and naturally our conversation turned to the Kardashians. We had determined which Kardashian each member of our family is most like and were beginning to refine those comparisons when my mom walked into the kitchen.
Davis told her who was who, then he began to list everyone’s secondary Kardashian personality, like: “Mom is the Scott Disick of Kris Jenners. Katherine’s the Kim Kardashian of Kourtney Kardashians. I’m like…what am I? Just Khloé?” And I was like, “Yeah LOL.” Later I said he was the Kylie Jenner of Lamar Odoms of Khloé Kardasians, but mostly he’s just a more self-aware Khloé and is sore because he would rather be Kourtney because she’s our favorite. Mom was agitated because we told her she was Kris, and she remembered that we once told her that we hate Kris. But she can’t deny that she and Kris are twins, down to the fact that they both love any house decoration that has a rooster on it. Dad may have some Bruce Jenner or Lamar Odom in his equation, but he mostly transcends comparison.
I think I’m the only one who didn’t complain about their Kardashian analogue. In fact, I am OVER THE MOON about mine. Sometimes Kim and Khloé just don’t catch on to what is going on around them, but Kourtney always knows what’s up. She’s the smartest Kardashian sister, and she knows that. Also, she does this thing where she’ll be trying to help someone and she’ll ask, “What is this doing for you?” And sometimes when her sisters are tormenting her she will call them “you sick freaks,” which proves how alike we are, because that’s how I react to my brother when he’s being annoying, and I’m always doubtful that anything I do is actually beneficial to anyone.
Netflix Instant provides a single word in its “this show is” section for Keeping Up With the Kardashians: scandalous. This makes no sense. OK, there was a sex tape, but is that really, truly “scandalous”? It’s definitely a scandal in that many media outlets reported on it, but it’s not actually shocking, it’s just something people habitually call a “scandal.” (And anyway, only the first episode of the first season really deals with the aftermath of Kim’s tape.) Is it just that the Kardashians’ money, their tendency to rock club wear in the daytime, and their frequent mentions of genitalia (usually via the euphemisms saussige and vajeen) give them an aura of “scandal”? They’re a tight family that’s concerned mostly with supporting one another and making loads of money—what could be tamer than that? ♦

I hold a strawberry by its tip in summertime, and I should be enjoying it. Its juicy plumpness is illuminated by a shaft of sunlight shining through a triangular gap in my drawn curtains as I hold it close my face. I’ve taken a bite but I don’t taste its sweetness. My mouth tastes slightly bitter and stale. I reflect on my poor stomach, turned over and over again by weeks of anxiety. It could be that my brain is beginning to pick up its usual pace again: The tranquilizers my doctor prescribed me two days ago must be losing their effect. Part of me wants to go back to that doped-up world where I felt a shield between me and reality. 
At least I am peacefully alone with the gentle whirr of my electric fan, and my bed, and my half-bitten strawberry. Things outside, including the brash sun, aren’t affecting me right now—I am pretending they don’t exist as a form of survival. I can’t begin to think about what I might be missing or the time I am wasting. I need to be here, right now, and relax as much as I can. That means not thinking—partially not even existing. 
A few weeks ago my level of anxiety outweighed my ability to cope. I couldn’t physically carry on the way I was going. I constantly felt sick. I couldn’t eat or sleep properly, or go anywhere without my mind spinning into intense, irrational thoughts. I resorted to crying uncontrollably in bed all afternoon—it seemed my only option. I could hardly leave my bedroom. I felt I was going mad. 
I looked at myself in the mirror for the first time in two weeks today. Before, I couldn’t face the fact that I was a physical being, the same as everybody else, people who are able to continue in the form that evolution has crafted them in. I have two eyes, four limbs, all my internal organs, but I feel like I am missing something in my mind. Or there is an abundance of something, still unknown to me, that shouldn’t be there.

I made it to Wales in the car with the family. The idea of getting away from the stifling heat and the claustrophobia of our suburban neighbourhood was appealing. Of course, sometimes you think if you move somewhere—a significant distance away from where you think your problems live—you’ll feel completely different. But things follow you, they always do.
One bad morning I was staring at an unfamiliar ceiling. There were faint smears on the wall opposite my bed that I assumed the owner of the holiday cottage had purposefully covered up with a gaudy painting of Bermuda, a sea so far away in distance and essence from the simple Welsh sea that I could glimpse from my bedroom window that it seemed distasteful to hang it there. I thought, amongst hot tears behind my eyes, that this was a good metaphor for me. The smears were dripping out from beneath this misplaced picture, a front to cover up the darker stuff underneath that was now leaking through. 
I walked to the beach with my father. A simple goal that I knew I could achieve without much anxiety. There was still a brash heat, but the blue of the sea was cooling. Dad wandered about and collected a pocketful of gold-tinged stones and told me to pick the ones I liked best. As I dug absentmindedly through the sand in front of me while trying to explain to him how much I felt I needed help, I uncovered a darker greenish stone. I decided to own that one, too. Then Dad came up with his own metaphor—the three gold pebbles and one dark were like me. For now the dark was all we could see, but the gold would be uncovered again.
After lunch, in the full heat of the day, I reclined on a beach towel on my own. It was nice to feel alone. I lay on my front, eyes to the burning sand, slipping it through my fingers, thinking of the way cliffs and rocks and stones eventually become. My mind focused on how there are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the beaches in the world put together. This I could not comprehend, but it quieted my cloudy mind. I picked up handfuls of sand again and again and let them sieve through my hands. I did not feel minuscule like a grain of sand. I didn’t feel like a giant either. I felt like nothing, like I imagine an animal or a plant feels. Nothing mattered, and even realising that nothing mattered did not matter. 
Of course, it didn’t last long.

What is referred to as a heatwave in Britain might not be made such a fuss of elsewhere. The newscasters take temperatures slightly over 30 degrees Celsius (about 85° Fahrenheit) very seriously. While watching the news I lost count of how many times I was warned that the people most vulnerable to hot weather are the elderly, the young, and the sick. 
Still, in this kind of British heat, everything feels like it is dripping or melting at the edges. The sweat on people’s reddish backs, the corners of houses and roads, the hot air visibly rising – all merge together in one hot claustrophobic sphere. 
I am writing this at three o’clock in the morning as I can’t sleep from the heat. The sea breeze no longer makes a difference. It is our last night and a Friday (a week since my meltdown) and I can hear drunk Welsh people. Someone is playing “Don’t ’Cha” by the Pussycat Dolls. Idyllic. 
I am going back home feeling better. I miss people, not things. I want to see them, I don’t want to hide. My doctor referred me to a mental health clinic, so I will potentially have a place to air my issues again, rather than sweeping them under the carpet. I thought that because I had had therapy before, I wouldn’t need it again—but things have changed and I have new and alien things to deal with now that I didn’t have to deal with then. 
I’ve remembered that other people can’t cure me, but I can ask for help. Not help for a miracle recovery, but help and support in order to help myself. Asking for help wasn’t easy. I thought I should be able to cope on my own. It’s the summer before I leave home for university; I am meant to be having the carefree time of my life. But that’s not how I work. And I feel more OK with that now. ♦

I enjoy being lazy and hairy sometimes. I like staying in all weekend and observing the real shape of my eyes appearing as the layers of eyeliner and mascara slowly rub off. I like leaving my hair as it is and not giving a shit. I like that occasional grimy feeling that lets me know I am truly relaxing. I absolutely detest the idea of being completely hairless—I’d feel like a doll, not a human, and I don’t fancy going back to being pre-pubescent. 
It’s easy to say this on the internet or in solitude. IRL I do shave my legs and armpits, and I’m not sure why. Is it for convention’s sake, for other people’s approval, or because I truly prefer it? Or because it is so much easier to be conventional? Or because when you’re dancing in a club and you want to put your arms above your head but it’s hot so you stripped down to your vest top and your armpits are a bit furry because you haven’t shaved in a while, you might keep those arms firmly at your sides for fear of being seen as disgusting or distasteful or dirty? 
Without other people’s influence, I am completely confident in my convictions. The idea of doing things that don’t align with my feminist principles, like removing body hair when I am not sure I actually want to, gives me a rubbish-rotting-in-the-hot-sun kind of feeling, like sewage in my soul. I suppose it makes me feel awfully insecure. I don’t have a problem with other women deciding on their own preferences, as long as it makes them happy. Although I do find the infantile look of completely hairless women slightly discomforting. 
I am becoming apathetic in this thing called “real life.” I haven’t been reading read any feminist articles I may flip by in the paper because they trigger feelings of guilt about all of this stuff. I feel like I am betraying myself and other women by adhering to societal expectations that used to be so easy for me to reject. Beliefs that used to make me feel liberated now make me feel disgusting and wrong. I keep my opinions to myself because I don’t have the energy to defend myself again and again. 
People who seem great otherwise so often turn out to harbor negative, damaging ideas about women deep down inside—and they don’t even realise it. It is exhausting trying to show them what I see. Sometimes it feels like there’s no point. ♦

Last week I was suffering from sleep deprivation and felt gray and lifeless. Then, after a particularly soporific English literature revision this week, I listened to a Sister Sledge tune and felt like myself again.
There are so many great things about disco. When it emerged in the early ’70s, it was about inclusivity—its roots were in gay culture, and women and people of color were better represented in the scene than in the straight, white world of rock. Feminism was gaining momentum, and women expressed their own autonomy, strength, and sexuality in popular songs, my favorites being Donna Summer’s “Love to Love You Baby” (the 17-minute version complete with sex noises, of course) and the Andrea True Connection’s “More, More, More.”
Also, it is literally the best music to dance to! The lyrics are usually about being happy and dancing, which is such a simple concept that even my exam-riddled mind could understand. It’s impossible to sit down when you hear a disco beat—it’s like a LIFE/DEATH situation on the dance floor, and the song is everything. Disco eventually became popular, then overexposed, and then unfashionable, but I will never put it down. (The “Disco Sucks” backlash in the late ’70s was mostly just an excuse to be homophobic and racist.) My final exam schedule has been intense and crazy, but how could I not smile while listening to this?

I am beginning to learn that love—romantic or platonic—is accepting someone’s imperfections, because you are not “perfect” either. Affection does not follow perfection, or at least not some airbrushed idea of what another human being should be.
I used to believe that if someone did something that offended your sensibilities, your love for them would be sullied somehow. Learning about someone’s so-called imperfections kills their mystique, and mystique is an important part of that elusive thing called “cool.” “Cool” people have a tightly controlled self-presentation that makes it seem as though nothing touches them. When you learn more about them, they don’t seem so cool anymore. It is the same way with fictional people and famous people (who may as well be fictional people, because that is what they are in our imaginations)—which is why it is so easy to develop crushes on film characters and musicians and other distant people you will probably never speak to. The vision of them in your head isn’t marred by those qualities that make them fallible. You don’t know if they make grammatical mistakes or have strange taste in wallpaper. And they never look you right in the eye. Having real-life relationships with people can be hard, because they are deeper than an image on a screen. 
I had always assumed that I had to be faultless in order to be loved. My faults include snorting involuntarily, watching embarrassing daytime TV, spending too much time on the internet, and having a period of my life when leaving the house felt impossible. I thought these unflattering idiosyncrasies had to be hidden, that they constituted a blight on my person. I would worry about them being known because it was like a slip in my masquerade, an unflattering angle on the image of myself that I so much want to have control over. I wanted to be someone infallible, impenetrable like a fortress. Ideally someone hard to know, so that I had to remain accountable to only myself. I have had to learn, to accept, and to remind myself frequently that it is all right to loosen my control over my image, and that doing so is necessary in order to form real connections with other human beings. 
Having feelings for someone real can be scary, because you are not sure how deep or wide or long or high they will reach. They seem potentially limitless. When you look someone right in the eye, you don’t know how long it will be until you can look away. The eyes are said to be the windows to the soul, and now I have a new understanding of why: If he looks into my eyes for long enough, which he does, it is impossible for me to hide anything. But he already he told me I don’t have to. It was when we were waiting for a taxi. We were standing about 20 metres from the club; I can’t remember if we could hear the muffled thumps of the music inside. He managed to make this scene feel cosy, like some parts of each of us were cuddled up somewhere by the glow of a log-lit fire. We were standing by a wall overlooking a small part of a canal. There were tiny slugs sticking to the damp stone walls of the cold, flat buildings, and we followed their trail and counted all 30 of them with a strange childlike glee. It has gotten to the point now where I lose count of all the things I like about him. ♦

An unpleasant bout of anxiety has resurfaced recently. It feels like a tiny aftershock after an earthquake–scary, but tiny compared with how it used to be. I feel lucky; I am able to forget on a daily basis how horrendously out of control anxiety can make me feel, otherwise I am sure I’d have much more fear of it coming back for good. It’s unnerving, though, to feel the symptoms of panic and anxiety again. I’ve been waking up with an anxious nausea that intensifies when I can feel my thoughts start to bounce off each other randomly, never connecting. The world seems much harsher—objects feel rougher, and I am constantly on edge. I am readying myself to fight a lurking danger that may never come to the surface.
Now that school and exams are over, I have nothing to help burn away my nervousness—school at least gave me something to channel my energy into. The anxiety just sits there, congealing into a sick feeling that hides in my throat. It’s frustrating—I am probably the happiest I’ve been in a long time, I have everything I could need or want. But that doesn’t mean I don’t get anxious, and being “happy” comes with its own set of obligations and concerns: the pressure to leave the house every day, the pressure to be productive, to put my newfound freedom to good use. Sometimes I just want to stay in bed all day—and I know that’s all right to do occasionally, but a new thing that happens is that when I try to, I get restless. I have friends and a boyfriend I want to see, and I worry about when and how I am going to see them. Making plans gives me a certain amount of stress that I can’t really explain.
I want to be less selfish; I want to look after my friends. The more I get to know them, the more I see how much unhappiness there is spread among us. Everyone has their own shit they have to deal with. In some ways, it was easier to manage when my sadness was isolated and could imagine that everyone else was happy, at least. I am not sure whether it makes me feel better or worse to know that others feel this sadness, too. It seems unfair when people I care about feel depressed. But it’s comforting to know that after everything I’ve been through, I am uniquely qualified to help them navigate through it. I can point out symptoms and effects, I can listen and offer sympathy, but I don’t know how to make it better for them. ♦

My first week of being 19 was pretty average. I noticed I’m doing things that a part of me feels 19-year-olds shouldn’t do: going for walks without a destination, looking for little things like a blossom forming, the church spire, a spot on the horizon. Do adults always have somewhere to go, somewhere to be? In the garden, gliding through the air on a swing I’ve had since childhood, I stopped and thought, Can a 19-year-old do this? 
With each year and each new number, I’m still kind of waiting for life to start, expecting to get prettier, to gain intelligence, to become my “best self.” But this imagined zenith where everything comes together must not be the most important part of life, otherwise why do books always focus on the confusion and pain it takes to get there instead of the bliss and relative boredom of being content? At least with a book you know there is an ending, a certain number of pages left before the story can only continue in your head. (Does happiness continue until the end of the protagonist’s life? Does he or she find a house, settle down, start a family?) I can’t see where my final page is, but I often feel as if I am scrambling to get there, to find out how it all turns out.
I am slowly trying to come to terms with not knowing. Looking back to the beginning of this academic year, I can see that I knew nothing. Well, I knew about staying at home, the Smiths, feminism, the latest news, and studying for exams—but that’s really it. I’ve grown a lot. I think I finally feel on top of things, just as exam season begins. I am intensely looking forward to university now, and I frequently imagine myself there. I make up stories in my head for Future Me: what my bedroom will look like, what meals I’ll cook, what clothes I’ll wear, what music I’ll listen to, and the people I’ll meet. 
Imagination is addictive. We haven’t had a proper hot day yet this year, so I keep visualising lying in the sun, pure heat on my bare skin. In bed at night, I can almost feel it. I feel powerful when my recollection is that vivid. Whatever happens from now on, I’ll always have that. Sometimes imagination is better than real life can ever be. ♦

Recently my mind has quieted a bit, part of a recent trend where my mind is not continually in overdrive. I can watch the colours of life as they pass and I don’t feel so confused and disconnected. I don’t see my life as one big old mess anymore with a whole pile of problems; I can realistically register my strengths and weaknesses. It’s nice. 
I still fight against some mild form of social anxiety. No one who doesn’t know me very well would guess it. I cover it up with loud rambling, and have a lot of practice in putting up a front. Those skills carry me over that first initial hump of fear, and once I’ve gotten a chance to get used to my environment, I really can enjoy myself in other people’s company. Like, a lot. But I am still afraid of going into social situations on my own. I can be alone just fine, but to be thrust into a room full of people that I don’t know, or at least don’t know very well—that is a challenge.
I overcame just that challenge this week for a college friend’s birthday gathering. It was a completely new circle of people where I wouldn’t be buffered by my close friends, so I was wary going in. By the end of the night I was happily dancing at a place I’d never been to with someone I had only been properly introduced to five minutes before.
The party had started at the pub, then we moved to the birthday friend’s house. Everyone was “chillin’,” but I really wanted to dance. Mention was made of a place down the road; I wanted to go but the others weren’t keen. Except, that is, for this one guy I kind of know from college—he wanted to go, so he and I just left together and walked through the suburbs, back to the high street towards this sort of hybrid of a pub and club. He was pretty drunk but he guided me in, up the stairs to the music—it was a relief to hear such loud music. I met a few of the guy’s friends. I danced till closing time. 
I figure if I can fend for myself even in this weird world that exists only at night, when you are able to become close to people you have only just met amongst the smoke and sweat, then I am doing pretty well. I was so happy to be oddly alone and unaccountable. I felt free. I was in a place that existed outside the usual constraints of school and schedules, of sober socialising and sticking with friends on nights out. I liked these strangers. I almost felt outside space and time. I got in at 4:30 without a second thought and still wasn’t tired. ♦

I read something truly terrifying in the paper the other week. There, tucked away in the penultimate paragraph of a passionless defence of the title Miss, was this offhanded remark: “We learn the vast majority of our vocabulary before the age of 18 (you add a few odds and sods after that, but they don’t become part of you and your working daily toolkit, permanently and easily accessible without a moment’s conscious thought).” I would describe the feeling I got when I read that as total abject doom. I am 19 years old, which, if the newspaper columnist is correct, means that my brain’s best word-learning days are behind us.
I went outside to get some air, and the descriptors that float through my head are the same ones I’ve used for ages: blooming, fresh, fragrant, fertile, damp, blossom, bursting. I am frustrated by this deficit of expression. I describe things, but not in the sort of detail that conveys anything like my reality, the way the world exists for me. None of my words feel right. It’s all been said before.
I feel this all the time, like there is a huge gaping hole in my comprehension. There are things that exist in my mind that I cannot convey. It’s like a form of amnesia—I think something, some word or phrase, should be there, but I look for it and can’t find it. Sometimes, while I am preoccupied with trying to find a way to fill in these gaps, the present runs away from me uncontrollably fast. 
This year of school, for instance, has passed in the blink of an eye. It will all be over in a month—school, exams, the place, the people. And I regret that, I regret that it will all be over so soon. Then what will I do? What will I do when I don’t have work to avoid, when I don’t have a place to go five days a week? I got so used to the friends I made and the routine that I created. There will be none of the structure that I’ve found so helpful. 
This ending is sort of anticlimactic. I am not preparing for my final exams with any urgency right now, even though they are quickly approaching. But I am not “laid-back” either—the very notion unnerves me. I am mostly on edge about my inability to do what I feel a deep desire to do, which is to create something original, to put this weird existence into words that will properly describe it to myself and others. For now, I can only call it “weird.” ♦

I am hungover. And not a nice hungover (when you don’t feel too rough but can indulge in an excuse to be lazy all day). It’s finally warm and sunny outside, and I’m wasting the day inside, feeling hungry and nauseated at the same time. I’ve spent outs trying to figure out what to write. I’m terrified of all of my ideas, because people I know in real life might read this. Writing confessional stuff for complete strangers to read feels kind of liberating; the idea of people who have seen me in the flesh reading it is a nightmare. Like being stripped naked but a lot worse. (I actually don’t mind being naked that much.)
I find it hard enough to log in to Facebook. Something about Facebook generally makes me cringe inwardly. You’re encouraged to share everything there. It makes me feel exposed, like I can’t hide anything—and I really like to hide things. I like to keep things private. I have had a recurring dream for years now about needing to use a public toilet and something is always not quite being right, like the lock doesn’t work, or the stalls only come up to hip height. It’s kind of gross but I always figured it was my subconscious worrying about my privacy. 
I wish I could give people a pill that would make them forget certain things I’ve said or done in front of them. I wish I could present a sort of contoured version of myself, editing out the embarrassing details. Maybe I am scared of being being “found out,” of being known. I have one friend whom I tell practically everything to, and I don’t have an ounce of fear around her, but that’s because of a trust I have built with her over years. She was the one I called when I didn’t know what else to do.
The worst thing, though, is hearing things about yourself from other people. That’s been happening to me a lot lately—people have been talking about me. I don’t know how to talk about it without talking about other people, who deserve their privacy, and anyway that would be hypocritical. All I can really say is that it doesn’t feel better than before, when no one even knew I existed. ♦

I’ve got studying on my mind 80 percent of the time: If I’m not doing it, I am preoccupied with it. English is a closed-book exam, so I have to memorise relevant quotes from poets like William Blake and Dylan Thomas and Philip Larkin. I’m feeling increasingly distant from my other exam subjects, like history and politics, and beginning to think English is my niche, especially after seeing all the parallels between the texts we’ve studied this year and MY LIFE.
While reading Thomas Hardy’s Tess of the d’Urbervilles, I learned of a literary technique called pathetic fallacy, in which nature and the seasons are personified to reflect the main character’s emotions during certain periods of her life. For example, Tess’s hardship is conveyed by the descriptions of the lonely and desolate landscape of the grey farm where she is poorly treated. 
My need to find order in chaos leads me to look for my own pathetic fallacies. In the middle of last winter I was at a miserable low after a miserable experience with a miserable boy, and I felt as dark and exhausting as the season. I was caught off guard by something I had no experience with, and it wasn’t pretty. Same with Tess—she went out into the world completely innocent of predators and their intentions, and got caught in a specific dude’s web. (Only she—spoiler—gets pregnant out of wedlock and gives birth to a baby who then dies, so in comparison I was very fortunate.)
Right now, when the trees are heaviest with pollen and the days are long and languid, everything is infinitely better. It reminds me of Hardy’s sensuous descriptions of the dairy where Tess works and where she falls in love with Angel Clare at the peak of the summer heat. There is a new guy who treats me like a goddess, as Angel did Tess, but I don’t have to walk on eggshells like her, worrying about how to tell him the story of my supposedly blemished past. I already did that on Friday, on a bench, as the sky got lighter and the full moon lower, and he didn’t say, “You were one person, now you are another,” like Angel did when Tess revealed her past on their wedding night. 
I told him the basics of my whole mental-health history and the world didn’t end, and what I’ve learned is that way more people have mental-health issues than you first assume. I am not such an anomaly. I thought that as soon as someone found out, they would treat me differently, but it doesn’t work like that. There was no doom like the kind that Tess has to unfairly face when (another spoiler) Angel turns out to be a dickhead and leaves her because she had sex with another man. 
All this has been a veiled attempt to study for my exams while simultaneously making my life as poetic as possible. ♦

The light from the setting sun just hit my bedroom—two neat squares on the wall opposite. It’s a specifically spring light and my favourite time of day.
This is always a reflective season for me. I get strange and nostalgic, staring intently at the sunsets and the clouds that melt like softly-coloured ice cream sundaes on the horizon. Spring is in the sky, but not down here where it is still freezing and frosty. Snow covers the roofs of the houses, patchy and placid.
It’s Good Friday, but it doesn’t feel like it. Nothing feels the same anymore. I’ve become so accustomed to years of similar patterns and returning feelings to the point that events on a calendar evoke little response from me. Christmas, birthdays, and special occasions don’t seem to matter much. Something within me has changed, though I am still not sure what. It didn’t feel right going to church like I usually do—I don’t know why. Church was open for the afternoon, and usually I just sit on a pew for five or 10 minutes. Last year I wasn’t able to do this because my toe was fucked up and I couldn’t walk. And this year I am too distracted by work and social stuff that my developing ideas of God and prayer don’t even penetrate; I am in some kind of bubble. I hate it.
I keep on thinking of people instead of ideas. Faces instead of theories. I haven’t been growing in my mind—I’ve been growing outwardly instead, reaching out to the world in an unfamiliar way. I have to remind myself to expand inside as well, to read and not just in order to tick off a list of books, but because it enriches me, like when the sun momentarily breaks through the clouds and warms my face.
I thought about turning this past year into a film, and I even wrote a scene in my head. It involved boys, and it helped me clarify events. There was a boy I didn’t particularly want, but he wanted me. And there was a boy whom I fancied the pants off and have kissed a few times, but at the same time I struggled to give a fuck, which seems contradictory, but then I am a teenage girl with mixed feelings and a lazy attitude toward the hassle of relations. And finally there was—there is—the boy who started it all, and at times I wonder, Why him? And then I realise there is no reason why, it just is. The only person I’ve ever really “loved” for whatever reason didn’t love me back.
When I lie on my bed or the floor, all I see is the sky. Right now it is blue, with patchy clouds. I’m thinking about how much hope gets invested in spring and summer. There are so many plans dreamed up, so much grass to sprawl out on. Whenever I stand up though, I catch sight of the ground and the snow. It brings me back down to earth. I wonder how much longer I will be sitting in this strange ice age, where things still don’t make much sense. ♦

Standing on a platform at London Bridge railway station, about to catch the train to New Cross, Dad told me to look up—if he hadn’t, I might not have noticed. Only if I tilted my head right back could I see the tip of London’s tallest skyscraper, all 95 storeys of gleaming glass pointing to the sky. It was the first time I’d seen the Shard in the flesh, not on a screen or in the newspaper, as the last time I visited London I don’t think it was even a hole in the ground. I felt like I could reach out and touch it, but it was so gigantic that I couldn’t really comprehend it. Just like I couldn’t comprehend the holiness of St. Pancras station’s arched cathedral-like ceiling earlier that day or my journey on the tube before that where the women carrying her load of brand-new bed sheets and the man engrossed in a tilting game on his phone captured a different kind of holiness. One where the wheels and cogs of this mammoth city all seem to work together and create something special, down the to the bones of the people and the metal of the train tracks. 
But the most divine miracle was that I was in London at all. A couple of years ago it would have been unimaginable for me. Last year, when a pinprick of light appeared at the end of the tunnel of my two-year struggle with agoraphobia, when recovery finally seemed like a possibility, the idea coming to London was up there, shining like a shrine to freedom. It was something to work towards. But strangely, on Friday morning, it felt a normal thing to do. Which is exactly what I want. 
When we arrived, however, it felt surreal—like a film set of London, and I was just an extra. Like if I walked around a street corner I’d find that the buildings were just facades with no insides. And so many people! They don’t look at you at all, which only added to my feeling of being in a movie or a dream.
Thankfully I had Dad to hold on to. He was my navigation. He grew up in and around London, so the whole transport system is ingrained deep in his brain and heart. I kept repeating variations of “How can there be so many people, Dad?” My hometown of Birmingham is Britain’s second city and seems like a village in comparison. From my house, it’s 15 minutes travelling into the town centre and 15 minutes out into the countryside. 
I’ll have to get used to this largeness. With each route we took, I tried to memorise the names, familiarize myself with the bus numbers, pretend I was a local. I was staring into my new home. When we arrived at New Cross, excitement finally took over anxiety and I wasn’t sure whether to dance or cry because here was a place I had mapped out in my mind, seen in my imagination, and made reality. It was the final confirmation that Goldsmiths was the university for me and I didn’t even have to worry about being accepted because I already am. It just felt right. 
That sprawling sensation that London has, when we were on the train and could see nothing but civilisation pouring in all directions, simultaneously terrifies me and enthralls me. The suburban areas are full of small windows illuminating other people’s existences for a split second as one of our final trains shuttled past in the dark. It made me realise that to other people, I am also one of those small squares of light, a little box of existence. I take everything so deadly serious sometimes, I act as if anything could go wrong at any minute. Being a little person in such largeness is humbling. 
After having dinner with some of my family, we quietly began our mini-trek back home. As we got further away from city lights and travelled through blank hills and trees instead, the darkened windows became like a mirror. I wished they’d lower the artificial lights in trains at night—to see my reflection so close and so clearly was a little disconcerting. So I pressed my forehead against the glass, searching for any spotlight in the distance. My eyes followed the North Star, constant, all the way home. ♦

On Tuesday, I ended up doing the kind of bonding that only happens on a night out with other girls—including some from my college, girls I used to be slightly intimidated by. I was only planning on going to the local pub for a couple of drinks, but ended up in a taxi on my way to the club at the heart of town. I had gone to the same one the week before, but that night was crappy—my energy and morale were at an all-time low, and it led to a small identity crisis. Tuesday night was exactly what I needed to rub out all those bad feelings.
I said hi to one girl I was reasonably friendly with when we bumped into each other in the toilets, and she persuaded me to carry on to the next destination. My usual group of friends had assumed I wasn’t going to the club and left without me, and I was looking forward to surprising them, as well as enjoying the sensation of being with a new group of people. 
Once there, I danced, and comforted one girl over a boy, and just related to these people in a way I had never been able to before. They had always seemed far away and sort of untouchable, the kind of girls that are too cool to approach—I felt they were above me, I guess. But our booze-fueled socialising, and perhaps being together at night, when I suppose we are all a little vulnerable, allowed me to see things differently. It took witnessing them in this environment—getting embarrassed over boys, leaning on me when they were tired, dancing without a care, and all the things I had done myself the week before—for me to realise that these girls are fallible just like me or anybody else. It was wonderful. 
My brother’s best friend’s little sister, whom I had just finally met, ended up sleeping over at our house. She was a particular object of fascination for me, because she doesn’t seem to have an ounce of shyness. She glides through life and you glide through with her, not questioning what she does because she’s so confident. So as she, my brother, and I attempted to come back to life the next morning, she strode into my room and straight under my duvet to chat, and it seemed like the most perfectly natural thing to happen. And when she got on the phone to talk to the girl I had comforted the night before, she handed it to me and I comforted her a little again, and we said we loved each other and it made me so entirely happy. I love it when life is like this. ♦

Some days certain societal expectations/conventions get to be too much for me, and I have the urge to retreat, but I feel torn. There is a particular mood I get into sometimes wherein I don’t want to go out but I don’t want to stay in either. I don’t want to talk to people but I don’t want to be alone. I don’t want to be seen but I don’t want to hide.
I’m expected to go out and have “fun” all the time, to have a boyfriend, to have girlfriends, to be popular, to be clever, to know everything, to be interesting, to get good grades but not be a smartass, to look pretty, to wear nice clothes, to be happy, to be nice to everyone, to not get angry, to not have feelings, to not cry (but not be heartless either). To be independent, self-sufficient, stoic; to keep it together on my own, and not rely on others. To not get tired, to have good posture, to be fit and healthy, to eat enough but not too much, to exercise, to hold my alcohol, to know my future, to not get scared. To have a clean bedroom, to live a clean life but not be a goody-goody, to be fun and easygoing but not kiss too many strangers, to not be a prude or a virgin, but not be a slut either. To not be annoying or irritating, not like anybody too much, not be a hassle of a friend, not an attention-seeker, don’t be needy, don’t be too nice but be careful not to be selfish. To be tough, to not show weakness or naïveté or ignorance, to have an opinion but not too much of an opinion, to speak up but always know my place.
It’s this and more every single day, and it’s exacerbated by people I know and people I meet who neither acknowledge nor even try to comprehend the massive pressure placed on women in this world and the connection between that and women’s rights or (whisper the word) feminism. People who don’t get why I might want to live in a society where these pressures don’t have the power to make me, my friends, and other young women feel intensely bad about ourselves.
A discussion in my politics class this week added a whole new bundle of demands to the list: don’t go to therapy (it doesn’t work), don’t take medication (you’ll just build up a reliance), don’t like Sylvia Plath (she is a “narcissistic bitch”), don’t argue that Sylvia Plath wasn’t a narcissistic bitch (it was “just an opinion”), don’t have any constructive discussions, but rather just throw your stubborn opinions at one another. 
I’m a young woman living in a country that has normalised the sexualisation and objectification of women to such an extent that the biggest-selling tabloid newspaper features a topless female model on the third page of every issue, but what some people seem to find far more objectionable is the idea of a woman pointing a mirror at herself, staring at her own reflection, and exploring more than her appearance—Plath wrote about her psyche, her pains, and her pleasures. She wrote about the limited roles in life available to her as a woman in the 1950s and early ’60s, and how those constraints drove her to despair, depression, and self-destruction. Even if her writing is not exactly to your taste, surely you can appreciate what an achievement The Bell Jar was, and you must be able to see, if not enjoy, Plath’s astonishing talent, no? But apparently some people find nothing to admire in a person who, in the midst of a culture that constantly told her that her value is as a wife and a mother, and nothing more, became well known and earned the respect of a male-dominated literary scene by writing about her private life, thoughts, and emotions—no, that just makes her a “narcissistic bitch.” 
My politics class is full of strongly opinionated boys, and it is hard to make my voice heard over theirs. It’s also tough to keep my passion and anger down, to force my words into coherence, in any debate or argument that means something to me. There was a study last fall that concluded women spoke less when surrounded by men. I’ve noticed this tendency in myself, in class, at social occasions, and with family and friends. I will keep trying, though. I don’t care how small I feel, how worn down, how doubtful—I will continue to express my thoughts, feelings, and opinions, because I don’t know who I would be otherwise.
Maybe this makes me too a “narcissistic bitch.” Well then, I’m in good company. ♦

Every house has its own soundtrack. I am so in tune with mine that I don’t even notice it, but if the house were silenced, it would lose its character. Our furniture and belongings change, yet the pipes running through our walls still make their customary greetings on cold mornings as they warm the naked air. The central heating’s groans wake my sluggish mind and force me to turn my attention toward my uniform, which is balanced on the grooves of the radiator. 
Up the stairs is a ribbed green carpet that leads to the landing that runs the length of the house. Though their footsteps are muffled, I know whose feet are treading each stair, and in which direction they are heading. I can picture clearly the movements and motions that make those sounds.
Each creak of the floor and each squeak of a faucet—I know them by heart. If anything, our house is too noisy. The walls are too thin and you can hear almost everything. A sudden clang can startle a visitor, while I remain unfazed. I feel it would be rude to remind them not to talk so loud as sound travels very well here.
I live so much of my life in this house, and one day I just won’t. Nearly every day of my life has been about finding my way back here—the same twists in the car, the same uphill climb, the same solitary gravel paths. Choosing which route, quickest or slowest. Alone or with company. Keys in hand or fumbling for them in my bag. Delaying the last few steps or not being able to get in the front door fast enough. 
As always, I am stunned by the passing of time. My journeys remind me just how quickly every day goes by, and how this house will be silent one day, because I won’t be here to hear it. ♦

One very snowy morning last January, I trudged through a descending blizzard to retake an English exam that hadn’t gone so well the first time. School was closed for everything but the test-taking, and because of the weather, the brown-wood gym felt cozy and empty at the same time. Despite the cold and some slight nervousness, I remember being really happy. Exams aren’t so bad when they are final: at least everything you need to do is right in front of you on a square table you have all to yourself. 
This week I walked over there (through the rain this time) to pick up my results and found I had turned my C into an A. Not only that, but I was one mark off total perfection. I’d known I had it in me, but this was the first time I’d seen it in black and white. I almost didn’t believe it at first. Then I was an overcome with the most soothing feeling of satisfaction.
I never beat myself up about that C, but we were never friends. I didn’t mention my disappointment, because I was just glad I took the exam in the first place, and there was nothing I could do to change it until I decided to re-sit it, but I knew it wasn’t right and it wasn’t a reflection of my actual ability.
Now this was just one exam, but it has propelled me forward. I am not sure why getting an A in English is so important to me. Perhaps it’s because English is “my thing.” It’s the one subject I WANT to excel at in every possible way. As much as the pressure of grades frustrates me and makes me want to rebel, sometimes it feels like they ARE the best way to measure your capability. In some ways, the pressure is worth it, just for the gratification you experience when you look at a mark like that with your name at the top of the page. ♦

I’m quite an emotional person, but I have trouble expressing myself. When my parents and I had a meeting with my tutor last month to discuss my work and my anxiety, she mentioned that maybe the reason teachers aren’t softer on me, even though they’re aware of my issues, is because I give off the impression that I’m fine all the time.
Sometimes when school is dragging me down, or I am just ridiculously tired, I wish I could find a private place and cry with a friend or two—cry, get it over with, and wipe up that emotion with a few tissues and a hug. But I am not a crier. I don’t let my feelings out; I internalise them. All those tears are trapped inside me, and trying to shed them would be like drawing blood from a stone.
If someone were to notice, they could perhaps decipher a little of what I’m feeling by the clothes I wear. Sometimes when I need a defense against the world, I wear all black. It’s tough, it doesn’t let any light in, and when I put it on, I am a fortress of nylon and lace; my delicate rings become knuckle-dusters. 
This week I’ve played Rumours on my record player at least once a day. I am obsessed with the interpersonal dynamics in Fleetwood Mac. Imagine having to sing harmony on a song written about you by an ex-lover, like Stevie Nicks did? That takes humility. I want to be like the women in Stevie’s songs. They are mystical and they feel things, but they aren’t wimpy. Emotion doesn’t make them weak—it makes them wise. It’s the opposite of a pity party: exorcising demons with poetry instead of keeping them locked inside. Even in sadness, these women are strong. When love or life goes bad, they just wait for the rain to wash them clean. 
Stevie said recently that in the heyday of the band, she and Christine McVie were in a male-dominated world, and thus they could not merely walk into a room. “We have to float in like goddesses,” she told Christine, “because that is how we want to be treated.” Those are words to live by. This spring, I want to channel Stevie circa the ’70s: her look and her attitude. I want to embody those songs. ♦

There is a thick covering of snow again and it’s shitty. Our front drive never gets the sun; it is the last place in the country that the snow melts, which means Mum can’t get the car out of the garage and I always get this stranded feeling. It takes so much effort to walk through, as well. It’s meant to be SPRING, I am meant to be frolicking about in the daffodils. This time last year it was warm enough that I could lie on our lawn and read and feel the sun on my skin. This has been the longest winter I ever remember, and I am so so tired of it. 
I know it’s boring to talk about the weather, but pretty much everyone right now is talking about it. “It’s March!” they exclaim. “There isn’t supposed to be snow!” (Though now that I think about it I remember a few years ago when it snowed in April—but that was only a freak couple of days. This time, it is winter actually never-ending.) And it’s not just the snow. It’s cold and it’s windy and it has been this way for as long as I can remember and I am sick of my winter coats. 
Walking home from college, breathless from fighting the wind, feeling the chill biting my ears, neck, and head, I took note of my posture—I was all hunched over, closing in on myself, head down, bracing myself against the cold. It’s no wonder I’ve been in a bad mood; slouching stresses you out and makes you depressed. Don’t judge anyone in the cold outdoors in winter—they’re sure to seem unfriendly. We’re all rushing to the next warm place as quickly as we can; we don’t have time for a nod or even a glance at another human soul.
A few weeks ago, we got one day of spring. The air was warm and bright, and I smiled and said the cheeriest “thank you” ever to a group of builders who cleared the pavement to let me past. Pretty much everyone seems great when the sun is out.
Everyone around me is covered from head to toe, save for a slit of face, in a bulge of thermals, wool, and fleece, shuffling so as not to slip in the slush. Snow when it’s falling can be graceful, but there’s no way for a person to be graceful in the snow. ♦

I am so sick of my own egocentricity. The fact that I think I’m the centre of the world is the reason it spins out of control. I heard a friend to my left cough in class, a rusty bell ringing in the fog. He felt very far away, and in that tiny part of my brain that wasn’t panicking, I wondered how he could just sit there and not be swimming in intense, unwelcome thoughts. I was incapable of imagining feeling anything different from what I was feeling at that moment, even though I have been where I assume he was: in the clear. I’m not as accustomed to panic as I once was, when it used to arrive like clockwork.
I used to feel a terrible rush almost every time I went to class at my old school. Not a rush of life and excitement and love, but one that convinced me that the world was ending. 
I thought these attacks were in the past. I don’t want that terror to find a new home.
I took a detour after school so I could refresh my senses and walk off my nerves. I wanted to feel calm again, like white linen hanging in the breeze. I finally felt tranquility once I reached the park swing and surveyed the desolate greenery around me. I’ve decided the park is my favourite place. ♦

I recently read a magazine article about “visualisation”—a theory that says that you can manifest things you want by thinking about them very hard and believing they’ll come true, and that we “become what we think about.” This makes sense to me to some extent: a constant barrage of negative thoughts, for example, can easily transfer to real life. Sometimes I get stuck in a bad-thinking place, and it’s difficult to snap out of it. So it must hold true that if you think positive thoughts, the tide will turn in your favour, right? I’m tired of sitting around soaking in self-pity, waiting for the universe to come save me, so I thought I would try to take responsibility for my own emotional state by giving this visualisation thing a try.
I took out a sheet of paper so I could make a list of the things I wanted to manifest with my positive thoughts. Faced with that blank page, I realised how often I don’t even know what I want. Or how I feel. I suppose visualisation works only if you know what to visualise. How would you know for sure whether something was right or not? What if you got it terribly terribly wrong—would you be able to visualise your way out of it? Plus, doesn’t it take a certain excitement away, of not knowing what the future holds? On the other hand, my usual technique of waiting around for things to pop up on their own is not only really stupid, but also really boring. 
I can only conclude that this kind of thing doesn’t work for me because I am not enough of a believer. I am a doubter, a worrier, and a dweller. 
Lately I’ve been feeling like damaged goods. People around me seem so unimaginably free, and I wonder why they would want anything to do with me, tied down as I am with my barrages of bad thoughts. All I can do is drag them down with me. I don’t deserve their like or their love when I feel like I’ve gone bad, like my mind is rotten, while they seem fresh and wholesome. I don’t want to spoil them too by explaining what I go through. Anyway it would take hours and hours to truly convey what it feels like to battle with your mental health.
I feel as though I’m carrying around a massive weight. The weight of feeling constantly dishonest. Of pretending to fit in with other people who have never had the issues that I have. I’ve gotten good at putting up a front; only those who really know me would guess that anything was wrong. I don’t like to admit weakness and I don’t like to ask for help.
I could try to visualise not being the way I am, but I simply cannot imagine ever living with a “normal” level of anxiety. And that is the only thing I know that I want. ♦

Lately, after years spent sleeping with a light on, I’ve been enjoying the sensation of lying in natural darkness—it feels smooth and cave-like. Some light seeps in through my thin bedroom curtains, and I wonder how much of it is man-made, and how it compares to millions of years ago, when some distant ancestor of mine slept outside. No houses, no bricks or tarmac. Imagine that. Imagine living by the natural cycles of the moon and sun and stars. 
Everything seems quite grey at this point, and so artificial. The constant mechanical groan of cars makes me feel sick. I am tired of urban life. It is dull. Cars and roads and buses all look the same. The weather is cold and dry. The ground stays frozen beneath me. I keep longing for a torrent of rain, and that swimming sensation I adore: limbs stretching through atoms, rippling blue, while I use my muscles to glide through. Something to crack open the stillness of February.
But it’s time to accept that while school is grey and boring, there is no other way. I can embrace hard work—it is finite, and after months of seeing no end in sight, it finally feels that way. I don’t want to rebel against it. I am itching for forward motion, but I also like listening to Björk sing, “I don’t know my future after this weekend / And I don’t want to.” I keep reminding myself about what I wrote at the start of the new year—that you can’t make many plans in life, and the not-knowing is OK. ♦

Christmas felt very different this year. This realization swept through my mind whilst feeling very adult and mellow throughout all the typical Christmas experiences and rituals—the Christmas-tree needles on the floor, Mum’s birthday celebration, finding my stocking, listening nonstop to Sufjan Stevens, and the excitement and magic of Christmas Eve (which actually didn’t make much of an appearance). I went through the motions, trying to let it all wash over me. But of course it feels different, because I feel different. 
I have been limping through life like an injured animal. I am nursing myself in the best way I know how—by putting the brakes on everything and staying indoors a lot—but that doesn’t make me happy, just safe. I feel withdrawn right now, like my orbit is getting smaller, moving inward, farther and farther away from everybody else’s.
I’ve survived by leafing through Sister Wendy Beckett books. Listening to her speak about my favourite painters has really made me think more about the concept of “art,” and about getting something much deeper from it than just being aesthetically pleased. I’ve become slightly enamored of Van Gogh, and on Sunday, I knew I needed to see the only original Van Gogh near me. It’s a tiny little thing, but I always put my face close to it and see the texture of the brush strokes, noticing something new every time. I don’t know, I like little things like this. It makes my soul feel fulfilled. ♦

I know that at this point saying you don’t do New Year’s resolutions is almost as cliché as the resolutions themselves. But I usually feel that if you really want to change something, surely you don’t have to wait until the New Year to do it. 
This year, I can suddenly understand the sense of renewal that a New Year gives people. The days only get lighter from now on, and spring in on the horizon. Though I know that a whole year can’t be perfect, there is plenty of that frightening word: potential.
This December was really difficult for me. The seemingly never-ending days of winter hit me like a tidal wave. On New Year’s Eve I felt dragged down by life. I hadn’t felt well in body or mind for a while. My brain, of course, sprinted to the worst thought—that I would feel this way forever. Unwell, half a person, stuck like I have been before. Fortunately, I had a party to go to. 
A voice in my head just said fuck this and I put on my black dress and headed out, shaky but determined. I wasn’t planning to have “a good time,” but anything would be better than staying at home trapped with my bad feelings. The evening had potential.
When I got home in the early hours of the next morning, after kissing my friends at midnight and being walked home by a good guy and admiring the moon glow from a ramp in a skate park, I no longer felt that my life was (once again) falling apart at the seams. I was reminded of everything I did have, of things that had taken me so long to build up from a place of almost nothing.
I couldn’t sleep very well that night—too much blood pumping through my veins. But that meant I saw the first dawn of 2013, and as the sun spread a new light over the dead leaves and twigs of my garden I realised that you can’t make many plans. Life simply hands you stuff—things that you didn’t imagine or expect. It would do me good to remember this. My sort-of New Year’s resolution. ♦

I had a dream last week that was very green and sunny. I was taking a languid walk and had a vague sense of being homeward bound. The landscape had the kind of flawless beauty you only see on postcards. It was nowhere I’d been before, but I somehow knew my way.
I was comfortable with being alone. I felt whole and at peace. I came to a strange bridge over clear blue water and managed to cross it without falling in, though it was strewn with odd sorts of obstacles. I don’t remember much after that. It was a blissful, heavy sleep, and when I woke up, I felt as if I had been on holiday.
To dream of sunshine indicates that you are experiencing some sort of emotional or situational breakthrough… To dream that you are crossing a bridge signifies an important decision or a critical junction in your life… To dream that you are walking with ease signifies a slow, but steady progress toward your goals… Green signifies a positive change, good health, growth, healing, hope, vitality, peace, and serenity… The appearance of the colour may also be a way of telling you to “go ahead.”
This is from my out-of-print Dream Dictionary A-Z, which I got at a thrift store. Anyway, I think I am emerging from a period of high anxiety. All I can tell you is that I have been dancing from happiness this week, without a seed of doubt in my mind, because the contentment comes from within. It comes from the strength I found in survival. On good days, I feel a power that can only come in the wake of weakness. I don’t know how long it will last. I have plenty of schoolwork to wear me down. But I know I have it in me. ♦

You own everything that happened to you. Tell your stories…. If people wanted you to write warmly about them, they should’ve behaved better.
—Anne Lamott

Over the past few months, I have found many ways of letting go. Writing this diary may be one of those ways. I am trying to build up the nerve to write about something that happened, but part of me feels scared and part of me feels stupid. Part of me feels like a child with too many feelings.
But let me not lie or hide anymore. I have wasted too much thinking on this particular incident—but less and less so each day, like an unwinding clock that must eventually come to a stop. I wasn’t thinking about him; I was thinking about me. I was thinking about my part in this game, and how playing it changed parts of me that I had thought immutable.
Part of what lured me into the game that it was the first time this had properly happened to me—this being connecting in that way with another human being (or so I thought). I felt warm inside, full, floating. It wasn’t really him, it was the experience that was enamouring. Now that all feels like a complete illusion, but back then it felt intensely real. That was October. By November I was lost.
He was only one person among billions, but still, kissing him seemed incredibly important. Eventually he said he didn’t want to “mess [me] around” because I was “too nice for that”—like he thought I was some fragile little bird that couldn’t fend for itself. A number of things he said made me angry, but that was the biggest one. 
I hung on to my feelings for him a lot longer than I wanted to. They had somehow become deeply embedded in such a short time. I think it is possibly one of the worst feelings to care about someone more than they care about you. It doesn’t help when they are dishonest. It makes you feel weak and helpless.
That already feels like a long time ago. Now it’s just a blot on the setting sun of last year. I’m not sure if I learned anything from it, but part of me feels like it knows something new.

Sitting downstairs in Dad’s study, watching the snow tumbling down while my little black cat eats his lunch at my feet. 
I know that I’ve had this feeling before. This “Do I like him?” feeling. And I did turn out to like him a lot. It could happen again. I still don’t know the answer. My friends usually know that I like someone before I do.
Of course it is possible to feel those feelings again, for someone completely different. I both don’t want it to feel the same with a new person, and do want it to feel just as exciting and new as that one did. 
I’ll see how it goes. The snow is still falling. ♦

The snow disappeared this morning, which was as refreshing as the first day it fell. The pavements had become ice rinks, and the slush was getting into my shoes too easily, which discouraged me from making that extra effort to venture out. When I did, I found myself out of breath, exhaling puffs of white air while being uncomfortably aware of the way I was holding my body so as not to slip. I seemed to be struggling to keep my balance a lot this week.
I’ve been writing privately about recollections that might be dull for other people, like pages and pages about a single trip to the pub. I wanted to remember absolutely everything, because it was one of those rare hours when everything comes together, and not much existed outside our small ecosystem. A year ago I would not have been comfortable in such a bustling social situation; it reminds me of the confidence I have gained. And here were some of the first proper friends I’ve had in my life, whom I don’t talk about enough with you.
Writing with a reader in mind is a lot harder, because there are so many details about my life that I take for granted, but that need to be explained to others. I wish my words could take you with me on my walks to college and to the pub and in the snow. My eyes are blind to everything they’ve seen on a regular basis—things that would be utterly new to a stranger. I don’t always know which details are important. 
But my brain still begs me for time and space to myself, and then I feel ungrateful. This balancing act between being connected and disconnecting myself, though it seems like nothing, is tiring. This thing inside my skull truly is a muscle, and it’s working out way too much. I ended the week lazy and lethargic. I hope this mood doesn’t last, and I hope that the lack of snow makes it easier to catch my balance. ♦
