I think I have forgotten that green leaves in spring exist. Or is it like knowing you have 10 fingers and 10 toes—an established fact that you keep somewhere in your subconscious? It’s only when you injure a part of your body that you realise how much use you got out of it. It’s only when you have a cold that you remember how great it is not to have a cold. It’s only when there is a gap in the clouds that you remember the blue sky always exists. It’s only when you are having a grey time that the things you once loved really sparkle. 
I have exposed myself to people who are really just strangers. Spilled the beans. Shared my shit. I am chilly from it all. I want to be pickier about whom I talk to, and not just choose anyone who will listen. Now the trees are truly bare, I am fully prepared to hibernate and store my food (for the soul) like an animal. It’s instinct.
I instinctively play the same songs over and over again. It must be a coping mechanism. I go on YouTube and watch nostalgic pop song after nostalgic pop song, the related videos feeling as warm and comfortable to me as a blanket. I had to listen to the same Taylor Swift song three times to fill my walk to college one day this week.
On the way home two of my friends sang and hummed the song with me. It’s small moments like this, and friends like these, that I realise I need to be grateful for. Something innocently shared instead of stored away, and people to grab hold of and walk in the cold with.
When I said goodbye to my friends and was alone with my thoughts, I chastised myself for not having worn warmer clothes. It’s like I have been living in a self-imposed haze and expecting the world to haze around me. But I see it is crisp now, and it is time for layers and scarves and gloves. The cold has caught up with me, and I am remembering how to feel warm again. ♦

Last week I didn’t want to exist. I avoided my coursework and had the urge to hibernate all winter. I spent the first half of this week still avoiding my homework; I wrote reams of my own material instead. I read for my own pleasure and copied down quotes that made my mind active again. Then I couldn’t dodge my obligations any longer and managed through a fog of angst to start my 3,860 words of source analysis for my history class. 
There are two main reasons why I can’t stand assignments like this. First of all, it takes weeks of effort for me to even start to comprehend beginning such an essay, simply because of my fear that it won’t be good enough. And if it’s not good enough, what is the point? Second, as I am sure most students would agree, this kind of thing is dull as fuck. Writing so many words about something I struggle to care about (rich white men making history as usual), reaching into unused parts of my brain with the aim of steadily forcing out coils of useless knowledge, tires me out so that I can’t do any writing for pleasure.
The whole thing just makes me feel blank and grey as a slug. Even as I was writing this diary entry, I had to resist the urge to check the word count. My whole life feels like checking the word count. Do I have this, do I have that? What’s left to get? Why do I want so much? Why am I suddenly discontent? Have I been using this looming coursework as an excuse for my bad mood? Have I been using my bad mood as an excuse to avoid doing coursework? Why do the most boring things send me into an existential crisis?
Anyway, I just finished the first draft of my paper. But I don’t feel relief, just exhaustion. My friend came around earlier and helped me drape Christmas lights across my ceiling, but I don’t feel much holiday joy yet. My friend is too wise for his own good and left me with some things to think about, just when I wanted to stop thinking. But I am thankful. I will mull them over and probably write all about it next week. Unless I am too full of Christmas cheer. ♦

Last Wednesday night, I was feeling low, so I went on a walk in the dark, to try to pull myself together. And it worked, for a while. Something about the constant dull moan of cars, every pinprick of light in the dark, the glowing stained-glass windows of the church I grew up in, the way the ground feels slightly unsteady beneath my feet as I walk back towards that red brick of a house that I am stuck in for a little while longer—it all loosened me from a tangle of melancholy thoughts. I realised that though things may have happened to me that made me feel terrible, I can feel myself growing, expanding, and filling each corner of my body with experience. I sat on a bench—in the dark, I couldn’t see that it was wet—and I watched the buses pass in the distance. I thought about how if I had any money on me, I’d be in one of those buses, and I knew exactly where I would go. But, as with most things in my life, the biggest thing stopping me was fear. Fear that it would be a stupid thing to do. Fear that other people would think I was crazy. Maybe I am crazy. 
Why do I have to feel so much? I wish to be someone who doesn’t care, a girl who lets everything wash over her. On Tuesday, the night before that walk, at the pub with friends, I felt happy. I felt ready to move on from other things. But now here I am in a state of anxiety and sadness again, and I can’t remember how it felt to be happy and carefree. I don’t remember how I managed to feel any stability before. Maybe I didn’t. 
Anxiety can drop out of nowhere, especially after I think I’ve turned a corner. It seems like every time I think I’ve got my footing, something, almost anything, starts shaking me about. I feel strong and collected and whole, and then proceed to fall apart again. And I can’t tell whether this is an internal struggle, or whether it is caused by external events. Maybe college work and nights out and human interactions and relationships are just catalysts for more anxiety. The present is one huge maze. Sometimes I enjoy the twists and turns, sometimes I reach a dead end, and sometimes I completely panic and wonder where the hell I am. I try to look out over the edges, but I can’t see anything. And giving up and withdrawing isn’t an option like it used to be. I have to keep going. I have goals and dates—exams, university—ahead of me. I don’t feel ready, but they come anyway. I just wonder whether, with all this restlessness, I am ever going to feel stable again. ♦

My perception of men has changed very swiftly, in the space of a few months. I can’t pinpoint exactly when this switch happened, but whereas I used to be all “people are people,” now I very distinctly separate men from women. In my eyes, men are the Other.
This isn’t OK with me. It does not correlate with my feminist principles or my belief in complete equality among all genders. I hate it when I catch myself referring to “boys” or “men” as a single entity, lumping them all into the same pile of clichés and stereotypes. It just doesn’t feel right.
But recently I’ve started to discern a dividing line, delineated by the slight brush of an arse in a pub, or the groan at a brief mention of male privilege in a classroom. And all the touching—so much touching. My body is a battleground, an object disconnected from my personhood. It just has another waist for an arm to be placed around, another “front” (as a teacher called my boobs) to make a joke about. This same body has been touched this year in private, in a way that hasn’t made me uncomfortable at all. So I have been thinking a lot about the differences between the wanted touch, the unwanted touch, and the touches in the grey areas in between.
I have also recently experienced what feels like a gender divide in terms of honesty in romantic relations. People are always saying that “men are all the same,” and I have never believed that. But when I think about the guys I’ve known lately, that old cliché is starting to gain some weight. And then I think about how much I hate it when people say the same thing about women. I know we’re not all the same.
A bright note is that while 2012 has cast doubt on my opinions about relationships with boys, it has only strengthened my friendships with women and girls. I feel so inspired by the women I know, who have held me up when I’ve felt as thin as cardboard (possibly because of certain guys). These women didn’t have to listen to me rant and rave, to be patient with me, to let me make my own mistakes and try to give advice. And when they tell me I am beautiful, I believe it deep down, because I know that they understand the true meaning of beauty. And when they tell me I am a good enough person, I believe it, because they are too. ♦

I feel like there have been so many rapid changes in my life, changes that I don’t even realise properly until I look back, because they are too intricate and small to describe in detail. So many of them involve other people, so they are challenging to talk about. Yet I want to tell you everything, because most of those changes are happening within me. And there have been people reading these diaries since a time when life could be really tough for me. 
I am trying to figure out how to approach writing my diaries now, when I have more to write about than anxiety and depression and doing things on my own. I am not used to writing about other stuff! Anxiety still plays a big role in my everyday life, but it has diminished. Some days my mood is low, and I can’t really speak much or do anything but lie down, but it doesn’t last as long as it used to. Because almost every day, I’ve had to get up and out of bed and go somewhere and put on a face that other people can see and talk to. Some days it is hard, but some days I transform as soon as I see a friend’s face at school. Recently, it’s when I forget myself that I feel most like me. There are people around whom I actively LOVE myself, because I have all kinds of different parts of me invested in them. I feel more visible than I can ever remember feeling. My communication channels have burst open. 
It can be such a relief to have a Saturday all to myself now and then. I don’t like my moods to be dictated by other people. I like to be a whole entity by myself, and not feel like something is missing when I am on my own. Like I explained to someone earlier this week: being on your own is like romance, but with yourself. He replied that romance is better with two. I didn’t agree.
I think throughout all this change, I am still me. Of course I am. I have the same arms and legs, the same moles and scars, the same teeth, the same internal organs, and (I think) the same brain. Sometimes I feel like a heightened version of me, sometimes a lesser one who is often confused by “life.” But I embrace confusion and all the other tiny emotions that I didn’t know existed till now. ♦

I have had a mini crisis building all week. Crisis might be too strong a word, even qualified with mini—it’s more just a feeling of hopelessness. I’m overwhelmed by everything that needs to be done: schoolwork, studying for January exams, writing personal statements, applying to universities. I should have my shit together by now. I am 18, after all, and I took a whole year away from school just to get together said shit. But I used up that time falling apart and then putting myself back together and now I am more whole than I have ever been, but a lot fell by the wayside, like schoolwork.
I have so much to do, but I end up doing nothing. This is a familiar state—I was like this last year when I was studying on my own, at home, and I became overwhelmed with apathy. I was in my own head all day long, and didn’t feel connected with anything in the outside world. 
This time it’s different. I’m not spiraling inward; I have outside DISTRACTIONS—one in particular. I’ve always been independent, and I like that. But now my moods are suddenly being dictated by communication with a certain human. If I am not talking to him, I get moody. I was never like this before. I feel like a completely different person.
It’s really kind of scary. ♦

All these weeks of college* have been stacking up like building blocks of different colours. I am in disbelief that is the end of November.
I don’t want to get sucked into college college, work work, people people, but I can’t seem to help it. I went out to the pub with friends I have known for ages and was having fun until I suddenly panicked and thought of all the work I had to do, and I got terribly sad, and so I just left and walked home in the rain. My vodka and coke did not take the edge off; I am ignoring a huge stack of work that I can see from the corner of my eye.
And I am so, so tired. Because every day is different. And every day I try to catch my bearings, and I do, but then the next day comes.
An old friend said I was “changing,” and of course I am. How can I not be? Life is relentless. ♦

My grandparents live in a three-storey Victorian house with high ceilings, huge windows, and packed bookshelves. It’s big, but the more you get to know it, the smaller it gets. I’m spending the night here, which I always enjoy. At home I’m always surrounded by my own physical shit—my disorganized papers, a pile of clothes I’m too lazy to put away, all the books I haven’t read, personal mementos that I can’t seem to get rid of—which has come to symbolise my personal, internal shit. But here at my grandparents’, I can escape all of that literal and mental clutter for a bit. I can relax. I thought my own bed was my favourite place in the world, but I don’t sleep very well there at the moment. But last night, here, I didn’t even have to try anything to get to sleep other than getting under the covers and closing my eyes. 
Visiting my grandparents is also a nice way to escape the crazy routine I have become so entrenched in at home. I am simultaneously happy and sad with my life, tired and energetic, bored and excited, sick and well. I am used to one monotonous mood that drags on for weeks, not this new up and down, up and down. I am spinning so many plates at once it’s hard to think straight. I haven’t been able to concentrate on schoolwork, or anything else. There is something going on in each section of my life and I feel I owe attention to each part. It is all so overwhelming. And that is on top of the usual things like cleaning your room and brushing your teeth, which I find hard enough anyway. 
I wish I could be more like my grandpa. He’s a classical composer, and he still sits down at the piano in his study almost every day, with large sheets of musical staffs in front of him, hundreds and hundreds of books behind him, and a wonderful view of the sky out of the window, and gets to work. He always has an upstairs book and a downstairs book on the go, so he doesn’t have to tread the steep stairs to get fetch his reading material. I wish I could apply that logical approach to the whole of life. 
I have such a strong urge to get rid of everything at the moment, to empty my life—but I know I would regret it. I just want to stay here. I want to retreat, I want to hide away. That is always my natural instinct, my default in life. I keep on crossing the road and not minding the idea of a car hitting me. It’s not that I want to die—I just want a reason not to do anything anymore. ♦

Because of some routine school administrative stuff, I had a four-day weekend. I could have enjoyed it, but my head just wasn’t in the right place. I spent the first half in a foul mood, without much idea why.
On Saturday, Dad said I was being what T.S Eliot called a Rum Tum Tugger in Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats—a cat who’s always on the wrong side of the door. Dad said, “When you don’t have to go to school you feel out of sorts, but when you do have to go to school you like to find a way out.” I reluctantly agreed that, yes, I was a Rum Tum Tugger right then. But this annoyed a very deep part of me.
My mum was pregnant with me when my gran died. She’d met my older brother, but she didn’t get to meet me. She told my dad, her son, to bring up a strong-minded daughter. “How do you know it’s a girl?” my dad asked. She said she just knew. Well, I did turn out to me a girl and I know that most of the time I am strong-minded. I feel like I owe it to her to be that way, since she predicted it. It gives me determination. That’s why I hate feeling wishy-washy, being neither here nor there—it drives me mad. I usually know what’s up in my OWN mind.
I have had so much new human contact lately. New school, new situation. All of this interaction has been bending and shaping my mind, instead of my making up my own mind. This school experience has been a bit of a whirlwind so far. So much is new, and my brain spends so much time trying to process it all. I keep on fiddling with the concept of ME. If people at school like me, I struggle with that, because they’ve only known me a month. How can they like me if they don’t really know me, you know? I don’t know if their concept of Naomi matches up with MY concept of Naomi…and should it even have to? I’ve always known who I am when I am on my own. Now I am even questioning who that person is.
Sometimes I come home from lessons and feel a completely different person. I am finally completely and utterly alone with my thoughts, not having to juggle my feelings about other people, and it feels odd. The melding of these two people within me—the on-my-own me and the me with people—is a slightly painful experience. ♦

I usually like autumn and everything that goes with it, but lately I am seriously bored of the same old trees turning the same old colour and losing their same old leaves. Like, I love Birmingham for sure, but there is something really monotonous about walking the same grey streets day after day. When it rains, it can feel completely miserable, and having a head cold doesn’t help. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explore outside and kick leaves about and collect conkers.
The best thing to do, obviously, is to make a list of all the other places that I’d like to explore. When exams are over, I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. First on the list is the U.S. of A. Sometimes I imagine Adult Me on the road in America, because from what I have learned from the golden age of Hollywood, John Steinbeck, and Bruce Springsteen, America is the place where dreamers search for truth. I’d just need a car and a chance at earning some money in a cheap, cheesy diner. It would be worth it for all the people I’d meet.
After the Olympics were over, and we passed the torch to Brazil, I wanted to go there, too. Then I read about “the swing at the end of the world” in Ecuador, a tree house on the edge of a cliff with a swing hanging over the precipice, which sounds like the perfect Naomi magical experience as swings are my thing. So I am on a South American road trip in my mind: dancing on sultry Brazil evenings, watching little boys play football in the street, and trying to learn Spanish and Portuguese. 
Ever since I read Bill Bryson’s book Down Under, Australia has a fascinating hold over me: its history (people’s ancestors were criminals, ha!); its landscape (mountains, deserts, beaches); its tragedies (the treatment of indigenous Australians). And how BIG it is. How beautiful it is. I want to explore cities like Melbourne, and travel on the Ghan, and go to the top of the Blue Mountains, and see koala bears and kangaroos. 
The destination closest to reality, though, is South London. I am somehow most attached to the idea of going to university there. Being in London seems exciting. While I love to dream about faraway places, this is actually for real. And that is strange. But I am more excited about it than any of my other wild ideas. ♦

I am really glad I have been keeping a diary, otherwise it would be hard for me to believe that certain chunks of my life even happened. My diary (my actual private one, not this one) shows me my transformations—I’ve gone from almost nothing to a more fully formed life. It is comforting to have my thoughts written down, to have evidence that I was how I was. 
I can’t write
I am sad
I want to write so bad
Why can’t I write
I haven’t felt like I have written a “good thing” for a while. I haven’t felt that comforting tunnel vision that comes from making something that feels good while you’re making it and still seems good when you’re done. I’ve been distracted by adjusting to college.*
Isn’t it wonderful how quickly we can adjust to things? Human beings seem to have an innate ability to acclimate to almost any situation we are put in. No matter what happens, you carry on, you live, you adapt. It could be getting used to doing nothing after a long period of work and revision and exams. It could be having to go to a new building five days a week with lots of new people and new teachers and refamiliarising yourself with the concept of homework, and actually finding that you’re all right. Not just all right—you feel like you’re part of it, instead of on the outside like you were worried you might. You have actual relationships, and those are wonderful too. There are instant connections and connections you can work on and elements of bonding and old friends, too, that you appreciate so much more and people who are so similar to you but who live in a different part of the country or in a different country altogether. To have moments of feeling genuinely cared for—I can’t really ask for more than that.
You may also have a brother and a mother and a father, and though nothing is drastically different between you, maybe now there is more of a mutual understanding—especially between you and your mother, and you and your brother, because you are now getting on with your life like they did with theirs. With your father, there has always been and will always be a deep understanding, or at least an attempt at understanding, and there will always be shared viewings of SpongeBob after school.
But it sometimes scares you how quickly people can think they know you. Because despite all these conversations and an inbox full of text messages, there is a question in the back of your mind: you wonder when will be the right time to reveal to people what has filled your diaries, what has happened to you. Do you even want to tell them? Would you let anyone read your diary? 
No. The past is mine to tell. It is wrapped up in pages and pages of my own handwriting. And my future is wrapped up in the blank pages. As I sat tentatively in the front row in one of my first history classes this year, our teacher introduced us to this quote, which is widely attributed to Winston Churchill: “History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it.”** I scribbled that quote down straightaway to remember it.
There, I wrote something. ♦
* British for high school.
** The quote our teacher gave us turns out to be not quite right. What Churchill actually said was: “For my part, I consider that it will be found much better by all parties to leave the past to history, especially as I propose to write that history.”

Why does the last time I sat down to write my Rookie diary feel so long ago? Why can’t I work out what happened between now and then? Why does it feel like everything and nothing has happened all at once?
Nowadays I bombard myself with questions almost every time I write. But writing things down doesn’t help me figure them out. They are too complex, and they involve other people and a bigger sphere of reality. I can’t contain everything on one page anymore.
It’s my half-term* now, and the leaves are a crusty orange. On the first day of vacation, I went into the city with Kate.** That’s where we came up with the phrase “sphere of reality” while talking about how limited the human worldview can be. We tried on dresses and went to a rummage sale and shopped for semi-permanent hair dye (in a bluish tone for her, purplish for me). I like to pretend that a venture like this is a usual thing, but for reasons I’d rather not get into again, such journeys are difficult for me. 
While walking through the crowds toward the train, I was handed a pamphlet: Five Things God Wants You to Know. It told me I needed saving. It confused me. I felt something, but it wasn’t the feeling of wanting to be saved. It was: Why me?
We took the train back, and even then I didn’t feel entirely real. “A feeling of unreality” is one of the symptoms of anxiety that I remember reading about long ago, on some leaflet or other. Anxiety can still be the bane of my existence, and I still think about it every day. The nausea slowly intensifies whenever I think of something that could potentially cause a panic attack. But it will get easier. It will get easier, I kept repeating to myself.
However much I want to, I can’t wish anxiety out of my life. I can’t be “saved” from it either. I can only do my best, and that involves fighting and pulling punches and breaking down walls, and it can be so hard. I think back to last autumn, when I was very much on my own, and I realise I can never go back to that isolation. I felt the cold and the frosts and the dark evenings so much more. But that’s done now, that’s it. This is the next phase of my life, and I have to keep putting one foot in front of the other, instead of just standing still. ♦

I had nerves like blunt pins in my chest, neck, and mouth. Because I was “going out” to a new place. Out in the world—at night. It had been a long time since I’d stepped out into the darkness, and there was no way of knowing what I would find there.
I made my bed, turned off the lights, kissed Dad goodbye, and hauled my overnight bag to the car, then my mum gave me a lift to my friend Kate’s* house. The whole way I was chewing gum nervously, holding tension in my jaw.
As soon as I got to Kate’s house I dyed my hair purple. I hadn’t planned to, but suddenly I found myself leaning over her bath with mulberry water dripping from my head. I felt infused with magic—with spontaneity and mischief and everything I haven’t let myself enjoy for the past few years. My hair felt like a barometer for the rest of my night.
Kate and I called a taxi and waited outside. Through the car’s steamy windows I could decipher only pinpricks of light. By the time we got to our destination, the whole world was shrouded in a thick mist, like we were held inside our own special sphere. Our world was adorned: cocktails, disco lights spraying circles over the dance floor, the lights reflected in people’s eyes, Kate’s and my freshly dyed hair—all were jewel coloured. I danced and got lost. Only occasionally would I realise where I actually was, and how I was. 
A boy was there: Donald from my college (aka high school), who lives nearby. I had told him he had to come out so he could walk me to my grandparents’ house, where I was spending the night. We left the party just before midnight. The streets were majestically quiet. The yellowing streetlights illuminated the thick patches of mist, making the whole scene look like a film set. It was impossible for our voices not to be too loud; our conversation must have sounded, to people in their beds, like snatches of alien speech. Donald is really cool, and I felt safe.
When we got to my grandparents’ house—all three storeys of it—he seemed impressed. I didn’t want to go inside just yet. We both knew of a certain bench on the street, and we sat on it for a little while. Apart from the occasional passing car lights, the world felt empty except just us two. I could have talked to him all night. But I said, “I am so tired.” He said, “Do you want me to walk you to your door?”
Lying in an unfamiliar bed, I couldn’t sleep, despite feeling heavy tiredness through every limb. My eyes would close, but my brain was on fire, still excited and, on reflection, glad to be alive.
I didn’t feel like a fraud at any point in the evening. My fun wasn’t faked. I was me—but a new me I hadn’t met yet. That

Well…
IT’S OVER.
It’s been a year since I started telling you everything about my life on a weekly basis for this here magazine for teen girls. Crazy! This year just so happened to be my last as a teenager, and just like my PERISHING YOUTH, this column has an expiration date. It’s time for me to graduate from the Teen Girl Diary Zone and get old already.
This was the year when I finally got to live out my childhood dreams, such as living in a music venue, wreaking havoc in Los Angeles, throwing shows in my backyard, and actually enjoying school. I won my dream apartment and crushed on a dude or two and realized that since I live with my friends and my friends are always over, my life is actually a constant slumber party. Cross those off the list. 
It did get real real, though, when things like theft and violence and money concerns started pushing through the security blanket of being young and protected from such worries. But it’s OK, because this harshness is inevitable–it’s part of the contract for becoming an adult. Good times are optional, and it’s on us to find them. 
I liked sharing all of those ups and down with you each Wednesday. Thank you for being cool and nonjudgmental enough for me to put sometimes intense, sometimes embarrassing, sometimes stupid stuff here. And thank you for bearing witness to my first year of thinking, This is my life, and finally, it’s working. It wouldn’t have been as special without you. <3 ♦

There were two different ways my life could have gone this autumn―and the one I chose has felt a bit like when you pick up a puzzle piece and it locks smoothly into place with the other pieces. It is nowhere near the final piece, but still, it is part of the big-picture-in-progress. 
One possible path was to stay at home again, daunted by the prospect of stacks of work to manage, and lead myself through a syllabus on my own. I’d take my habitual walks and notice the teenagers shuffling toward the school near my house. I would wonder where I could possibly fit in to that puzzle. 
Instead I decided to try a school again, for the first time in two years. 
Two things happened this Monday (the first day of my first full week at school): in the lucid state between dreaming and wakefulness, sleepy old feelings about my last school crawled to the front of my mind. I remembered that awful morning feeling of not wanting to go―not a normal feeling of reluctance, but a force so strong that I would actually not go. I would do almost anything I could not to go. Monday morning I realised that this time, I had no choice but to go to classes. Not because of outside pressure or demanding parents or uncaring authority, but because I gave myself no choice. I liked that power.
On the way home for lunch, walking through the familiar church yard that somehow looked different, I noticed a bench that was not there when I had left for school that morning. It was as if it had plopped out of the heavens, clean and fresh, not one human hand seeming to have touched it. It seems like the most insignificant thing, but I thought, Wow. I wasn’t here to notice that. With so many days I used to have to fill on my own terms, I had become the principal of noticing meaningless changes in my vicinity―I needed such things to flex the muscles of my vision. These included a woman I would see from time to time reading to a man who, along with his dog, seemed not to have a home; a man who rode a motorbike to the library, where he would use the computers, once a week; a new signpost; a new park playground; a new bench. 
Everything took on a new significance in the days leading up to my first day of a new term at a new school, as a new person. Everything feels different now. When you’ve lived outside classrooms for so long, it is quite odd to find yourself inside of one, realizing you’ll be here when it rains, when it snows, when the leaves drop, and when they grow again. These are the signposts on my current track, taking the place of new benches. ♦

I am trying to think of interesting things that have happened to me in the last week that might actually be interesting to other people. But the thing is, I feel so NORMAL. Going back to an actual school and managing my anxiety have made me feel slightly BORING. And of course, NORMAL and BORING are horrible things that I do not want to be. But going to school and overcoming anxiety—those are things I am sure I wanted.
My old therapist warned me about this phenomenon that occurs when you are recovering from something such as anxiety or depression or the like, where it feels like you are losing, or have already lost, a part of yourself. It feels like you’ve lost a limb, or a chunk of your personality. It is a horrible horrible trick. I’ve felt pangs of it once or twice recently. A “who am I now?” feeling. What actually makes up who I am? Isn’t so much of me made of trying to overcome something that has been in my way—self-doubt, panic attacks, low moods, tons and tons of anxiety? It’s been such a long process, from my lowest point to now—why would I ever want to throw all that work away? Doesn’t that struggle define me? 
Though I’ve felt ashamed or embarrassed about much of what I’ve experienced, not being NORMAL has at least been something to differentiate me from everybody else. Now what differentiates me? Today I seriously looked at university for the first time and found a course and a uni that I would actually like to go to. Just like everybody else.
It’s a weird feeling. How do you people cope? ♦

I think I am warming to the idea of making acquaintances, that tentative first stage during which you have no idea whether relationships will fizzle out or turn into best friendships. I haven’t mentioned yet how kindly the atmosphere at my new school has been. I have, on occasion, been taken back by people’s friendliness—they have no obligation to even talk to me. And I am receptive to them, more so than I thought I would be. 
I used to hate it when someone would say, “I love meeting new people.” It’s such a cliché. But new people can be fresh and exciting. The prospect of discovering personalities and figuring people out has become intriguing to me, rather than scary or hard to stomach. I used to have a kind of us-against-them mentality, comparing the friends I felt understood me with those who did not. But my peers can be the complete opposite of me, and I can embrace that. In fact, I’ve found myself mulling people over—thoughts about them will pop up in the middle of my day. I used to be frightened of people who seemed different from me, but now I am starting to find them endlessly intriguing. 
Of course, at first, the fact that everyone at my new school already knew each other was very strange. I was in a sea of new faces and names. I tried to introduce myself—to get that out of the way—but after the first week, I found some people were asking me questions rather than waiting for me to initiate conversation. I almost feel part of it already, which never happened in five whole years at my old school. 
It is still early in the school year. I am still trying to get my bearings. I feel tired in some respects, and energized in others. Weeks seem longer and shorter at the same time. I like wondering what will be new by the time I sit down to write next week’s diary. ♦

There’s nothing about my week in Los Angeles that could detract from its being the best vacation ever. I got to do all of the same silly things that I would’ve wanted to do when I was 14, but I had the freedom of an independent young adult to actually do them. I drank Moët Ice Champagne for brunch in West Hollywood and snuck into private hotel parties in my hotel robe and sunglasses after hours. I brought Rookies to a rock & roll show and ended the night with a cookie-filled, Biebed-out dance party. I ordered a gourmet cheese plate at a restaurant and painted my nails with discount polish at a ritzy bar. My friend and I sat on a stoop on Hollywood Boulevard and heckled passersby while drinking huge sodas as strangers drew us a caricature and one even gave us a dollar. These sorts-o-things are the greatest part about being in the middle-youth, so I plan on stalling in the post-teen, pre-adult zone for the rest of my life as everyone else keeps going. Have fun getting boring, everyone!! Smize. I’ll enjoy my crazy version of youth for a long, long time…and Los Angeles is the perfect place to do so.
While the week felt like a ton of miniature fantasies coming true, this vacay also had a secret mission: I wanted to see if my dreams about Los Angeles would prove valid, or seem hopelessly naïve. After a confusing experience living there two years ago, I wanted to clear it up, once and for all. Do I love Los Angeles, or just the idea of it?
This is a very rare moment here on my Teen Girl Diary, but I don’t really know what to say, or how to explain. Except, maybe, this: Los Angeles has a lot of opportunity for weird fun, and I can’t ignore that it has special magic for someone like me, who likes too many things, too intensely, past logic. I can’t unpack what I love about L.A.—my love is difficult to collect and organize, all over the place like glitter that’s hard to sweep up. I still want all of it, though—the strange and the normal, the comfort and the excitement, the warmth and the adventure. Let’s have everything—why not? Who carrrres? Enjoy it. All of it.
Do you ever have phrases in your head that come up…not necessarily mantras, but little catchphrases to describe your life as if it’s a new TV show premiering THIS FALL? Some of mine are: CHRONICALLY STOKED, I’M ACTUALLY FIVE, and EXPLOSIVELY HAPPY. EXPLOSIVELY HAPPY is the ideal descriptor of my teenage condition, and I think it speaks to why I feel magnetized by Los Angeles, California. And yet! There’s a part of me, a sentimental part, that wants the comfort and charm of sweet places like Walla Walla, Washington. Maybe I’ll end up somewhere like that someday. But for now, L.A. really knows what I mean. L.A. is a feeling—one that matches my inner rumblings more than any other place.
I think the self I want to be already lives there. I just gotta go there and hang out with her. ♦

The Seattle Freeze is a condition simply described as politeness without friendliness; distance; suggesting to hang out with someone you met last weekend and them acting like it’s the most garish suggestion imaginable. Unfortunately for me, the Freeze is real. Seattle, where I spent my formative years, is a really challenging place to make new friends. 
In Seattle, it’s completely natural to be running around in the same social circle as a person for five years and never “meet” them, once. Up there, it’s not cool to be, well, like me: hyper, socially proactive, stoked about stuff. Everyone tries so hard to be cool that they miss out on a lot of stuff. By the time I was 16 I was 100% over that attitude.
When I moved to California for college, I was stunned by how different the social atmosphere was. Random people were coming up to me at shows and parties, introducing themselves, and chatting with me! I was BLOWN AWAY. Here were people with no reason to talk to me, but they did anyway! They were so approachable! So affable! I had entered the land of happy people, people who can be simultaneously cool and friendly—traits that Seattleites seem to consider mutually exclusive. 
That was two years ago. Now that I’ve gotten to know the social climate here a little better, I know that Californians aren’t just friendlier and happier and more energetic than other people, and more fun at parties—they’re also a lot better at hiding their dark sides. I say this because most of the friendliest, funnest, most amicable people I’ve met here have eventually unveiled personality twists that I never, ever would have expected. This shit is like reality TV! It keeps happening: I meet someone who seems on my level in terms of enthusiasm, fun, love of adventure, love of music, etc.—one of my people, I think at first—and they turn out to have a crazy secret or something. It’s disappointing to realize that people who are fun and stoked and have their shit together are probably few and far between.
I just found out one of my closest friends has been a lifelong habitual abuser of heroin and is currently on a destructive bender. I never would have expected that from this nice, awesome person I look up to. It made me rethink everyone else who’s disappointed me. There was the friend who picked a fight with me and totally ruined my positive perception of him. There was this really fun musician dude I met and hung out with for a bit, until he made the world’s creepiest moves on my roommate a lot, and once on me (he left her a 45-second voicemail of SEXUAL PURRING (ew sorry that’s a phrase now). There’s this other dude I thought was the sweetest, coolest EVER, and I was so flattered that he wanted to be friends, but then I heard remarks from others who’ve known him longer about behavior on his part that makes me uncomfortable. There are a lot more stories like that, too, of people I meet and think are great, then they turn out to be Sketchy Vibes Central. I said all of this to one of my older buddies in Oakland, and they replied, “Yeah, I know. It’s kinda like a California thing.”
Hold on, what? Is there not one location on the planet whose social culture supports people who are simultaneously HAPPY and OK? At least in Seattle, where people were cold and indifferent to me, they seemed like normal people under the Freeze. Is it possible, anywhere, to have your life in order, be stoked, like to party, and not be too cool to have fun? I haven’t figured this out yet, and I feel stupid, like my good-human radar is broken. Right now the moral of my story is: most people who seem happy are secretly fucked up. ♦

For the last two weeks, I’ve been working as a teacher’s assistant at my college’s graphic design class for middle-schoolers, which, um, was exhausting. After work on Monday, I came home and immediately passed out in my backyard hammock under the avocado tree. When I woke up, I glanced at the corner of the yard where we keep bikes. My yellow cruiser wasn’t there. Stolen. 
I love my objects and keep a healthy distance from them, since everything dies one day and the invisible things are what’s most important…but this does not extend to my bike! My bike is forever mine, and that is a truth. I feel like the laws of the universe have been broken. In a rare moment, I really don’t want to talk about it anymore. But the event set the tone for the week.
When bad things happen, my mind sets off like a slinky. I decided that I was very upset with my weight again, a really boring problem that no one should ever cut me any slack for, because I’M FINE I SHOULD GET OVER IT. I felt so low-energy while teaching the kids at camp, which left this pit of disappointment in my stomach. I didn’t perform anywhere near my best. I could have been the cool TA! I have so much potential to be a preteen’s hero, and I want that so badly. Instead, I whiffed my opportunity completely. 
So the negative vibes go slinking. All this ugly thought manifested in some intense self-blame. I was chastising myself for having a fragile positivity that depends entirely on external events. I tried everything to get happy: a night in the letterpress studio, cleaning my room, exercise, Clueless and a bottle of wine. I couldn’t force myself back to normal. 
I spent a lot of my teenage years feeling defeated and self-loathing, and I hated it. It made me lazy and sad. That’s why I have so little patience with myself right now. Grown-up me doesn’t have room for this, because there’s no time to waste being angry anymore.
Life just seems too good to be true most of the time, and weeks like these are the reality check. It’s a fine line between indulging an emotion and actually resting in a feeling, but I’m learning that it’s important to be there for myself without judgment if I’m wading through an emotional shit swamp. There was nothing I could do this week to get out of my bummer zone. But by Saturday, my work week was over, and I had a plane ticket back to Seattle, which made me happier. So maybe that’s the lesson: I let myself be sad, and for once, I didn’t hate myself for it. ♦

Anywhere you grow up will disappoint you in some way. Seattle was often frustrating for me, because DUH, I spent my adolescence here—everything was frustrating. But I turn 20 on Friday, and I don’t have room for teen angst anymore. While there are plenty of things that can never be adulted out of me, I decided this week that it’s time for me to retire my angst Seattle. And the minute I stopped resenting it, I fell all the way in love with my hometown. 
I’m there now, going through old stuff because my mom is moving in with her boyfriend on Saturday. This is the weekend when everything comes to an end, pretty much. I’m looking at it all laid out in front of me. All of my memories are mine, though, and I still get to keep them forever.
No one else has these:
I’m 16. Growing up on Capitol Hill means that my second-grade soccer games are played at the park across the block from the clubs I go see my friends’ bands at now. Posse on Broadway namedrops my cross-streets. That mind-blowing mural of a pterodactyl eating a Metro bus on the side of the bookstore on Broadway and John hasn’t been torn down for the light-rail station yet because it’s only 2008! Growing up on Capitol Hill means that everything is around me all the time and I try my best to absorb all of it and I owe my life as I know it to this place.
***
I’m 12. There’s this local band of six boys that are the current loved-or-hated band of the city. Of course, I LOVE THEM. Love makes me a MySpace fangirl, and I go to every one of their all-ages shows. So far, that’s seven or so. They put up with—even encourage—my tweenage enthusiasm, and now I’m not just a fan, but a li’l baby-size friend. Yeah, we’re totallllly friendz.
***
Now I’m 15. They eventually put me in their liner notes AND their Myspace Top 8, which is the pinnacle of my life on the internet!! They also introduce me to a whole new sphere of the city, the one where the music is, and that changes everything. I don’t suspect that they realize their impact on me. Thank you, guys.
***
I’m 14. I finally get to sell my handmade hair accessories at the most delightful store in the world. I start bonding with the owner, and she becomes my creative mentor and life coach as her store becomes my second home. She’s taking me backstage at the Gorge to meet my favorite band for my 15th birthday; she dresses me up and lets me walk in her legendary fashion shows; she allows me to hang at her shop every afternoon like she’s my babysitter, but she calls me her intern, and I learn about how to run a business and plan a grand fête as I try on ’50s prom dresses under the watchful eye of my pink-haired guru. Her cat, Vincent, is the closest thing I have to a boyfriend.
***
I’m 15. The afternoons not spent at the shop are spent at the record store on 15th Avenue with my best friend, who is a grade above me at my high school. We met at that record store 3 years ago. We buy our vinyl and stake out the organicfairtradesustainablelocalsolarpowaredsoyflavored coffee shop across the street to complain about our all-girls high school and scheme about our upcoming, more-exciting social life, which consists of going to a show every single weekend because there’s nothing I’ve ever liked to do more, and I now have an ideal partner-in-crime.
***
I’m 18. My prom is inside the Space Needle, so.
***
I’m 15. Weezer has been my favorite band since I was 12. I loathe anything they did after 1997, but I love the first two albums so much that I’m certified obsessed. Message-board obsessed. They’re playing a secret show at the all-ages venue I work and basically live at, and today is the day I will tell guitarist Brian Bell that he was my junior-high crush. I will tell him this with a bite of burrito in my mouth, and I will never regret it because it will be the most surreal moment of all time. 
***
I’m 12. My K-8 offers a Friday night ski bus for middle-schoolers, which means I get to spend three winters of my life snowboarding weekly with all of my friends. Everything happens on ski bus: make-outs, breakups, concussions, Red Bull overdoses. This might be the most fun I will ever have.
***
I’m 19. Ski bus totally might still be the most fun I’ve ever had.
***
I’m 12, or 16, or 20 or 50 or 90. I spend all rare moments of sun on the shores of Lake Washington, where on a clear day the mountain is out and it will literally melt anyone into a puddle. Lots of life happens there: it’s where I take my friends for drunk swims off the dock on summer nights, where I have opened many a bottle of wine with my bare hands because I’m a teenage animal. It’s where I spent every hot day of the year at Madison Beach since I was five years old. It’s where my mom and I take my dog for rehabilitating swims after the life-threatening knee surgery he got when he was seven. It gives me so much, and it is my favorite. 
***
Nothing was perfect and everything was what it was supposed to be. I got to be a teenager in a beautiful place. Now, I thank everything. ♦

I get this particular feeling every time I come back to Seattle, where I’m from, but I can’t tell if it’s relaxation or exhaustion. I get home and just feel weighed down—my energy level drops, which makes me feel anchored and calm, but also lethargic. Either way, it can be a nice change.
This time, though, I think what I was feeling was drained. I spent last week helping my mom move out of the house I lived in all through high school, and into her boyfriend’s house. If you haven’t done it—and congratulations—moving is the all-time most exhausting activity in the entire world. It’s both physically and mentally draining to go through every single object you’ve accumulated over the past six years and rank its value in your current and future life. I let go of a lot of stuff. Attachment takes energy, which I had very little of.
The combination of my coming home after my first full summer being busy and independent in California, and the unavoidable sentimentality that comes with moving, made us all kind of wishy-washy. My mom confessed in the car that over the last couple of weeks she’s felt really emotional for no explainable cause—at any point, she could start tearing up. I just replied, “Yeah…,” but inside I was like, “Um, welcome to my life.” Walking to my dentist appointment last week, I cried because I saw the mountain. When my dog greeted me with licks on my birthday, I cried. When I looked at my childhood photo albums while sifting through storage, I cried. I’m always most homesick when I’m actually home.
Another feeling I get whenever I come back to Seattle is this conflicted sense of belonging. I am me because of where I’m from. I feel understood here—or maybe I understand here. At the same time, there are a handful of other places I have fierce affection for, places that complete me in some way. Unfortunately there is no way to take a map and cut out my favorite parts with an X-ACTO and glue them closer together in a dreamland conglomeration. And unless I become a rich betch who uses “summer” as a verb, I won’t ever be able to have EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME. Seattle is not the perfect place for me, but it is a crucial part of the puzzle of what I want out of life.
I guess that there is no one place for me. There are places, and there is me, but no city is my soul mate. I get along with different places for different reasons. Sometimes I get frustrated because I love too much of the world; or because it feels like if I were just one type of person with one type of life, there would be a single perfect town for me and I wouldn’t feel this conflicted all the time.
I’ve just spent so much time, especially here, in front of you, fretting over where I belong and what’s right for me and what place fulfills everything I need a place to do for me. But maybe that’s not the way to look at it anymore.
As I get older (gag), my perception of time changes, and life feels way less rushed. EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME might be my mantra, but it doesn’t need to be. There’s no need to cram everything I love into one period of my life. I have a lifetime and a lot of ideas: I’ll be able to get around to everything.
That means for now, Seattle is home. Other places are other things. I’ll live in all of them eventually, and hopefully before I croak I’ll feel fulfilled. Or maybe I should stop looking at places for fulfillment and figure out how to feel that at home on my own, wherever I am. ♦

I’ve spent a lot of time hanging out alone or spacing out at work the last couple of weeks, so I get to daydreaming, and it’s mostly taken me down MEMORY LANEZZZ. I’ve also been going through old playlists, which I seldom do, because I base my playlists on particular emotional conditions. I know from a glance at a track list how I was feeling when I made HALOW33N [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ or Funeral Songs, in Case I Die. I typically don’t want to revisit them, because they’re time capsules; indulging in them now feels like listening to Christmas music in September. But for some reason I’ve been listening to a playlist called Spring Break Home lately, which was curated for a trip to Seattle that I took in March, a few days after I was assaulted.
March was kind of insane: I spent two weeks straight in the studio at school during midterms. I said goodbye to the crush boy formerly known as Crush Boy. I got beat up on the street walking home from the bus. I flew home for three days during spring break to be with my mom and deal with everything. For a long time I hid how very, very hurt I was that the crush boy never said anything to me about the attack, but eventually I admitted it to my mom. I returned to San Francisco for three days of glorious partying at a music festival, and I felt like myself again. Spring break ended at the beginning of April, and life kept going.
The playlist consists of songs that defined that time for me. “Shattered” by the Stones reminded me that to live in Oakland, you must be tuff tuff tuff tuff tuff tuff, while “Just Like a Woman” reminded me to stay strong (I didn’t want to break like the girl Dylan sings about). King Tuff’s “Bad Thing” was released on the internet literally the morning after my attack, so it was like my power-pop life raft. As always, Neil, my favorite voice of all time since the beginning of time, brought me home with “Walk On,” so I could make it through those next few excursions, which were pretty difficult even in broad daylight. 
Looking at the past seems pointlessly indulgent, and I am brought back to events that I’ve made an effort to emotionally detach from. But it’s halfway through 2012, and sometimes checkpoints like this aren’t totally trivial. This is a good year. This is one of those years that make me want to go to a grassy hilltop in a ball gown and spin around, looking toward the sky with arms outstretched, gaily proclaiming, “This is MY year, HUNNY!” which is what I imagine a weight-loss commercial in January might look like. 
I think about a month like March, and I realize I’m stronger than I suspected. At the time, all of the stuff I was going through seemed routine, but as I look back I’m stunned by how absurd and challenging it all was. I refused to realize it then, because I thought it was better to deal than to dwell. But screw the idea of feeling indulgent. It feels good to use the past to remind me of my personal power, even if a lot of it comes from rock & roll songs. ♦

I was dog-sitting in San Francisco for most of last week, and for a while, I pretended that I actually lived there. The apartment was on Van Ness, which runs all the way through the city. After a party one night, I took the bus and got off a few stops after my friends. I spent a while wandering alone in the part that changes from being thick with pedestrians to being clogged with traffic. The fog made the air thick and soggy, and moisture clung to my hair. The entire city was open to me. 
Walking alone on the edge of downtown without a plan or direction felt like an act of defiance. There was no one to worry about me or wonder where I was. There were no parents texting about my whereabouts, there was no curfew, just me and the sleepless city. 
A lot of people would see this as liberating. But the more I walked, the more I realized how alone I was. Despite all the activity and the traffic, I was the only moving person. All the other human beings were asleep under blankets in doorways. If this was a moment of total freedom, it didn’t feel that way. Loneliness is a burden, and all of us on the street were alone together.
I’ve decided that whatever San Francisco’s type of freedom is, it doesn’t feel like mine. This city has always left me cold. Its size just ends up being isolating. Even when it’s one in the morning and I’m 19 years old and I’ve got 20 dollars in my wallet, I don’t feel free. 
Maybe it’s because I know another taste of freedom that has nothing to do with the big city. The summer after my freshman year of high school, my family rented a house for a month in Walla Walla, Washington. It was just my parents, my dog, and me for four whole weeks. Walla Walla is a small town in wine country that played perfect host to all of my nostalgic feelings about America and small-town life and the sort of childhood my dad had in Kansas. I had spent so much time pining for a life that resembled The Sandlot or Stand By Me, so a vacation in which I spent all my time biking the back roads to the tennis courts, lying in the park with my dog, and going to the ice cream parlor on Main Street seemed like magic. I was far away from my social life, and I didn’t really make any new friends, either. It was a good kind of isolation: I had the space to do all of my thinking. I spent 90 percent of my time by myself and in the sun; it was the most solitary—and yet the happiest—month of my life.
San Francisco is the densest city I’ve experienced, the other extreme, and I’m contrasting the two so that I can figure out what I really want. I’m obsessed with thinking about where I belong. Every day I spend in San Francisco I find myself wishing I could go back to that small town, or find another place like it. 
I will never feel at home in city solitude, but when I glorify that small-town experience, am I ignoring the rewards that San Francisco offers? I know I’m romanticizing a way of life that might not even really exist, and I fear that I’ll never be satisfied with any town. All I know is that 24-hour corner stores and congested bus routes don’t offer the freedom I’m looking for. Maybe what’s important is being able to have the space to think and a place to belong, rather than being just another body walking through the fog at one in the morning. ♦

Going to an all-girls school made me anything but enthusiastic about warm and fuzzy gatherings of females. There were a lot of “opportunities for sisterhood” that left me consistently uncomfortable and full of angst. For whatever reason, it made me really embarrassed to identify as a teenager and as a girl, both of which I happen to be. I never felt super teen-y, at least in my own mind. I think a big part of me is totally adolescent and will never grow up: my Hello Kitty collection, my love of pop music, the way I dress. Socially, though, I never felt entirely like the teen I am (at least for another month—panic attack). I just couldn’t relate to the “let’s have a slumber party and braid each other’s hair!” vibe that plagued my high school both in the classroom and in the cliques outside of it.
I guess it doesn’t feel genuine to me. Forced bonding? Want to dieeeeeee. I hated overnight CYO camp. We had yearly retreats in high school that were designed to make everyone communally spill their guts in a twisted, overly-emotional ritual of sentimentality concerning WOMANHOOD and COMMUNITY and JESUS. I am sorry, but again, I want to dieeeeee. That was my attitude, and so I did die a little bit every time I had to do something schmaltzy like retreats or camps or even, honestly, graduation. Where did this leave me for most of my life? It left me apathetic about being a girl, embarrassed about being a teenager, and fundamentally uncomfortable with myself, despite many of my very feminine and very adolescent interests. If this mushy version of community defined what it was like to have lots of teens or lots of girls in one place, I wasn’t buying it. I couldn’t think of anything less cool or sincere than forced, fake, female bonding. Mostly it’s the manufactured sentimentality that rubs me the wrong way. Don’t tell me what I’m supposed to love! I’ll hug you if I feel like it!
Last weekend, however, was different than all of the above. At the San Francisco Rookie meet-up, I was digging a whole new set of vibes. They pretty much eradicated any trace of cynicism in my JADED, JADED 19-year-old heart about gaggles of teen girls getting together and eating ice cream and hugging. OK, the way I phrased that is sending me back into my apathy zone again…but if you were there, or at any of the other meet-ups, I’m sure you can testify to how TRULY great the event was. Rookie in general has been a pretty affirming voice, even at the tail end of my adolescence, about how good it is to be young and to be a girl (or, even if you’re not, to be those things in your heart). (I’m barfing in my mouth as I’m typing this, who have I become?) Seeing the community manifest itself in Dolores Park, which is where I normally go to drink on weekends and pretend I’m cool, defied my negative connotations regarding large gatherings of women being awesome and in love with each other. It can be real, it can be cool, and I can get into it. Really into it. I was, like, really intensely into it.
I also want to mention that I finally had the chance to assault the Road Trip crew with hugs I’ve been saving for the past 10 months as I’ve gotten to know them in our Rookie Office in the Sky (the internet–they are not ghosts). I was pleasantly surprised by how weird they are. This website is made by total FREAKS. And I love them. My adolescence is on its deathbed, y’all, and I am glad that before I get to the crippling age of 20, I get to feel how awesome it all was, and is, and forever will be. Thanks for not sucking, everyone, I like you, and I hope to see you next week in L.A.! ♦

Los Angeles and I are in a complicated relationship. As a person who has a really romantic sense of place, I get so emotionally attached to towns that it sometimes gets in the way. L.A. is where my dreaminess really ends up being counterproductive, and I know this from experience.
Four days after I turned 18, after months of California dreaming, my dad drove me away from my mom’s house and in the direction of L.A. It felt like I had just eloped with some thrilling almost-stranger and our honeymoon was 100 percent magical, filled with palm trees and ice cream. Los Angeles was totally foreign—I felt like someone took a hammer and cracked the eggshell I was living in, shattering the world open for me. Anything was possible and everything was happening.
There were a few factors that contributed to this sense of awe. First, I was experiencing all the freedom-feelings of leaving home, which was exciting enough on its own. Second, I was so sick of Seattle’s dreariness, socially and weather-wise, and L.A. remedied that. Third, moving there was an act of impulse over intuition. I chose a school that wasn’t a good fit for me, because I was allured by both the city and the college’s glamorous reputation and promise of opportunity. 
That being said, I had built up L.A. in my mind. And it delivered, at least for the first few weeks. I had a lot of awesome experiences taking public transportation and wandering around, exploring neighborhoods with unfamiliar demographics, and tasting everything new I could find. Also, I realized I REALLY LOVE PALM TREES. It was the perfect place for me to be, in the sense that what I needed at age 18 was something completely NEW. 
Still, there was a lot about the city’s unfamiliarity that was more challenging than inspiring for me: the car culture and the sprawl were huge shocks, and a lot of L.A. is just so ugly. Through my school, I encountered a lot of bad attitudes and competitive people that made me uncomfortable. Not all of the newness was pleasant. Despite that, when I decided to transfer schools, I felt like my attachment to the city had already formed, and I knew that someday I’d come back and try my hand at living there again. 
I’ll never regret leaving L.A., because I love it here in Oakland. But I still feel like I am in denial about L.A.’s disappointments, as if they’re pesky practicalities that are in the way of my romantic vision of the place. 
I’m heading there today on a bus, and it’s my first time going back. I feel just like I did two years ago as I prepared to move down there: full of vivid daydreams and uncontrollable excitement, even though this time I should know better. I want to live there again, maybe after graduation…but am I forgetting what it was really like? Is my romanticism leading me to ignore the things about it that disappointed me? I feel like this trip is a test: am I just making up unrealistic visions, or can my life really be filled with indefinite sunshine and tacos? Maybe by the end of my week there, I’ll be able to separate my dreams from reality…unless I’m lucky, and I can have both at the same time. ♦

My goal in life is for there to be no valid reason for anyone to dislike me. You know, except if they be jealousssssss. That makes my ambition twofold: to be as awesome as possible, and to stay out of any gossip zones or touchy situations. I don’t want anyone to be able to back up their negative opinion of me with something I did to them. If you don’t like me because of my high-pitched voice or how I laugh at my own jokes or how I post a lot of stuff on Facebook (even though I’m GREAT at it), that’s your deal. I just don’t want anyone to ever be able to say, “I don’t like her because she talked shit/spread a secret/stole my foxy boyfriend. WHATTABITCH.”
Therefore, I’ve taken strides in my youthhood to avoid shit-talking anyone, which has helped a lot in the hotbed of gossip that is all-girls high school. Staying neutral is staying safe, and I left enemy free. Now that I’m well out of high school, though, I’ve been more…open about talking about people, since my social world is bigger and more complicated and worth the conversation. Truthfully, I’m uncomfortable with how much I’ve been talking about people behind their backs lately. I feel like I’m breaking my own code, but I wonder if it’s really that much of a problem? When is talking about someone specifically “shit-talking”?
There have been more than a few times in the past year when people close to me have put me on edge. Passive aggression drives me insane, which I know is ironic, because I’m telling you about my secretive venting, but it’s been an issue with family, friends, and even some Important Adult Figures. My way of dealing with negative feeling about friends has been to go to another close person and vent about it. Other people must talk about me, too. Venting is OK, right? 
I’m cautious about my reputation, I guess. Not only do I want to avoid opportunities for anyone to think of me as that kind of person, but once I catch myself being gratuitously analytical, I feel super shitty. I worry that I’m being a bitch and that anyone might have reason to be mad at me. I guess the moral of the story is if I’m going to talk about anyone in private about something that’s bothering me, I should probably speak with them directly at some point. That, and be damn sure that I don’t give anyone anything to say about me. I mean, unless they’re just jealousssss. ♦

People say that smell is the sense most connected to memory, but I think music is more powerful than anything smelly (unless it’s that weird bread-air at Subway and I think JUNIOR HIGH FIELD TRIP!!). I’ve been listening to Van Morrison a lot this week, while hermiting out for the first time in a while. My parents listened to a lot of Van Morrison when I was a kid—Moondance brings me to my childhood and its maudlin imagery: pictures of moments when parents were together and we lived in houses I loved and I felt wrapped in comfort. Wah wah, I used to be happy in a family. I hate myself for being sentimental about it, but I really did have a great childhood. My parents entertained at home all the time, and to this day the most comforting feeling is falling asleep to the hum of people gathered downstairs…usually with this song playing.
I’ve never really felt too sad about my parents not being together, because I know their divorce was for the best. I don’t really know why I’m doing it now, when things are getting more tense between my parents—probably because of new money concerns and the palpable discomfort of my dad’s knowing about my mom’s serious boyfriend. Writing this entry is probably the first time I’ve really cried about the fact that I don’t have happily married parents. Logic usually prevents tears: I reason that many people these days have divorced parents; I know none of us were really happy when my family was all together; and it was just one of those inevitable things in life. It’s easy to reason myself out of feeling sad, until I think about all the good times I had growing up, being the only child of married parents. I wrap myself up in the memories and realize that those times are worth something to me.
So when I talk about being homesick, it’s about more than missing my physical home. I’m remembering my childhood, and my family the way it used to be, before the divorce. And when I talk about growing up, that’s what I’m growing away from. I’m deserting all these perfect memories to do my own thing, become my own person. I’m ditching my childhood. 
I know my memories of my childhood are more golden than the real events that created them. But those recollections are so crucial to my understanding of life, and my first experiences of happiness, that growing away from them leaves me feeling somewhat…empty. 
Then, though, I remember that that Golden Era ended when I was 12, when my parents separated. They finally divorced when I was 15, I think. I’m not leaving anything behind. Those golden times already ditched me.
My mom’s constantly apologizing to me for “what happened,” as if you can just sum it up like that. The “what” she’s referring to is still happening—the consequences of divorce. The money quarrels, my confusion, navigating ex-marital minefields and needless complexities. I usually avoid having feelings about any of this, just so I can get through life day to day. Besides, what’s the point of dreaming of alternatives, of should-have-beens and expired wishes? They don’t exist. My parents are divorced for this and that reason, and so I have to deal with these and those results. Realizing that the good parts ended before I decided to grow up makes it a lot easier to grow up now. I just have to remember that the memories I love stopped production seven years ago. ♦

In astrology (thank you Susan Miller I AM YOUR LOYAL STUDENT), lunar eclipses cause big shakeups—but always in a productive way. It is a time of cleansing. In my understanding, the moon represents the subconscious and things lurking under the surface, and a lunar eclipse brings those things into the open, making stuff visible and therefore addressable. It exposes dysfunctional situations, which forces you to decide whether to try to work something out or just leave it behind.
There was a partial lunar eclipse on June 4; according to Susan Miller, the effects were supposed to last for a week or two. The moon that shines through my roommate’s window at night must have taken that opportunity to whisper through the blind, “What’s up it’s the MOOOON, it’s time to MOOOOVE OUT.” Because just like Susan predicted, a female roommate would be exiting the building. Literally, my horoscope said that.
I live with two other women, Leah and Kat. I’ve known Kat longer, but I’m closer with Leah. Suddenly last week Kat broke the news to me and Leah that she was moving in with her boyfriend that night. Kat’s name is on the lease, and Leah and I can’t afford to make up for her portion of the rent. So this complicated our lives. No worries, Kat said: she had posted an ad on Craigslist for her room, showed it to some random-ass person, and told them they could move in right away—without even telling us, much less giving us a chance to meet them. Leah and I were, uhhhh, upset?
Fortunately, one of my best friends, Maddy, is returning from Europe today and is taking Kat’s old room for a month—loudest sigh of relief in my life. And, truth be told, things had been tense with Kat for a while, for reasons that are not mine to tell. But they are reasons that needed to come to the surface and be dealt with, and now they have. And since Kat left, Leah and I have been hanging out in the most fancy-free, happy way. We drank and cooked dinner together last night; we’ve been planning the future like we’ve newly moved in, the shift in energy is so palpable. 
So thanks, lunar eclipse, for bringing stuff to the surface, instigating some necessary change, and solving some issues for me! I feel a little guilty admitting that Kat’s departure had a positive influence on the energy in our apartment, but hey. Sometimes things just don’t work out, and have got to change. ♦

I’ve always felt like such a self-confidence psycho. Half the time I feel like I am coasting on a dream cloud, and other times I don’t feel like I deserve the good stuff that happens to me. 
Let’s start with yesterday, an awesome day. I finished a week of full-time work and celebrated by eating an incredible sprinkled doughnut. Awesome. I got home and started planning my visit to L.A. to hang out with the Rookie road trippers and see some old friends, which made me hyper-stoked, because it’s going to be the best week ever. I talked to my mom about visiting as well, which made me hyper-hyper-stoked. Yesterday it seemed like nothing could get better; everything was already at its beautiful, glittery peak. Also, I made sure that I let everyone know how awesome things were! Some days you just feel like you have it made, you know? 
Then today blew chunks. After getting up at dawn for a dog-walking job, I logged on to Facebook and found out that my former Crush Boy is dating someone else. I hadn’t thought about him in a while, but that made me sad. 
I like to think that I’m pretty talented at not giving a shit during times like these. I’ll flame up with bad feelings for about two minutes, and then remember how much I just donnnnnnnn’t caaaaaaaaaare and continue on my trail of kicking ass at life. But for some reason, today’s bum-out lasted longer. I went negative. I hated myself for thinking about an old crush, and then I hated myself for hating myself. 
I’ve been thinking about that boy I knew last summer whom I treated harshly. From his perspective, maybe I was like his Crush Girl, and the way I treated him was mirrored in the way Crush Boy treated me. For every boy you blow off, does a boy blow you off? These thoughts triggered my feelings of boy-incompetence. I started going through my List of Dudes & How I Failed and sent myself into a hole of pity and malcontentedness and aloneness. 
That is, until I went for an amazing run around Coit Tower, took a shower, put on my favorite dress, and remembered how fucking great I am. SEE HOW IT SWINGS?! In two days, I went from feeling like I was hot shit to just the normal kind of shit and back again. I need to find a way to still be totally in love with my life even when everything is not perfect. I shouldn’t get so thrown by things that bum me out. Having my satisfaction depend on just the good times is an unsustainable way to build my confidence. And thinking I’m the shit isn’t the best way to boost my confidence, because that’s just my ego getting a quick fix. I have to calm this psychotic cycle so I can grow up and chill OUT and love myself just the right amount. ♦

Let’s start with yesterday, an awesome day. I finished a week of full-time work and celebrated by eating an incredible sprinkled doughnut. Awesome. I got home and started planning my visit to L.A. to hang out with the Rookie road trippers and see some old friends, which made me hyper-stoked, because it’s going to be the best week ever. I talked to my mom about visiting as well, which made me hyper-hyper-stoked. Yesterday it seemed like nothing could get better; everything was already at its beautiful, glittery peak. Also, I made sure that I let everyone know how awesome things were! Some days you just feel like you have it made, you know? 
Then today blew chunks. After getting up at dawn for a dog-walking job, I logged on to Facebook and found out that my former Crush Boy is dating someone else. I hadn’t thought about him in a while, but that made me sad. 
I like to think that I’m pretty talented at not giving a shit during times like these. I’ll flame up with bad feelings for about two minutes, and then remember how much I just donnnnnnnn’t caaaaaaaaaare and continue on my trail of kicking ass at life. But for some reason, today’s bum-out lasted longer. I went negative. I hated myself for thinking about an old crush, and then I hated myself for hating myself. 
I’ve been thinking about that boy I knew last summer whom I treated harshly. From his perspective, maybe I was like his Crush Girl, and the way I treated him was mirrored in the way Crush Boy treated me. For every boy you blow off, does a boy blow you off? These thoughts triggered my feelings of boy-incompetence. I started going through my List of Dudes & How I Failed and sent myself into a hole of pity and malcontentedness and aloneness. 
That is, until I went for an amazing run around Coit Tower, took a shower, put on my favorite dress, and remembered how fucking great I am. SEE HOW IT SWINGS?! In two days, I went from feeling like I was hot shit to just the normal kind of shit and back again. I need to find a way to still be totally in love with my life even when everything is not perfect. I shouldn’t get so thrown by things that bum me out. Having my satisfaction depend on just the good times is an unsustainable way to build my confidence. And thinking I’m the shit isn’t the best way to boost my confidence, because that’s just my ego getting a quick fix. I have to calm this psychotic cycle so I can grow up and chill OUT and love myself just the right amount. ♦

When I think about The Future, my thoughts are rarely worrisome. They typically include visions of sunshine and sprinkles and having a cool job that pays decently. Plenty of other people get squeamish about graduating from college and getting out of their little-baby bubbles, but I can’t think of anything more exciting! If right now rules, then by the time I graduate two years from now, I’ll totally be killing it! 
But this week’s thoughts about The Future were different, and I have sources to blame. Damn it, sources! The first was reading the news about the bill that the House passed this weekend that could effectively double student-loan rates, and the second came from watching Girls on HBO. I really don’t want to delve too deep into either of those subjects, but the student-loans bill made me panic for obviously reasons; and Girls pissed me off at first because I started comparing my level of privilege with that of the show’s 20-something main characters (their families have money), but then I realized that HA, I am in another position of privilege of not being in their position yet. Anyway, these two subjects’ coinciding appearances in my brain-space spurred me to scribble notes in my weekly planner about things I hadn’t really given complete thoughts to before: how much money it really takes for me to live, how many loans are in my name so far, how much I spend on records a month. 
SCARY numbers.   
OK, it’s not the numbers themselves that are scary. I only buy a few records a month, OK? It’s just a drag to acknowledge that, despite generous scholarships and financial aid, I haven’t escaped the quintessentially American experience of educational debt. This situation of mine is probably the least unusual of any I’ve written about here so far—every college-educated person we know in America is dealing with this. Student debt is as American as apple pie and baseball games…that cost $35,000 a year.* 
In high school, I didn’t really believe in a lot of the work I did to get my good grades, but I worked my ass off because I knew I’d need a scholarship to go to the college of my choice. My grades got me somewhere, and it was significant, but hard work doesn’t give you everything. You can work really hard and still have your beautiful head shat on by how obscenely expensive secondary education is. Students across the country are currently being shat on, on the head. Even the “perfect students.” Even the “well-rounded individuals.” Even the freaking “computer geniuses” who you thought were financially set for life. We’re all getting shat on from the sky. 
From my understanding, I’m in a pretty manageable position, financially, when it comes to college…comparatively. There are plenty of students all around me that will still be paying off their loans when their teeth are falling out (whether that comes from old age or not being able to afford dental care because of loan obligations, you can decide for yourself). If I can earn a steady, slightly-above-entry-level income for the next 10 years, I can pay my loans off before I’m 35, probably. That’s not extremely terrifying, right? That’s considered being in good shape? I mean, there goes all my money for buying records every month…multiplied by five. School is the best thing I’ve ever done, so I don’t have regrets. Just good old-fashioned bitterness!
I’m bringing all this up because it’s finals week, too, and I’m realizing that as of Friday I’m exactly 50% done with my undergraduate education. On top of that, there was this REALLY ENCOURAGING news that I read recently about only half of college grads getting decent jobs. I think I want to freelance after college, but that’s what I think now. What if I can’t even get freelance jobs? 
Let me put it this way. I’m not planning on having money for, like, 10 years. That’s not what I’m scared about. I’m scared about the obligation of loans and stuff, because that makes me have to earn money like it’s my job (funny), and what if there’s nowhere for me to do that? Lots of my friends are professionals at hanging out and working very part-time (if at all), subsisting off food stamps. That’s chill! I could definitely do that! But what I have that they don’t is a significant bill for a few hundos coming my way every month, according to the student-loan calculator of doom, that food stamps won’t cover. So, chilling out starving-artist style just doesn’t apply to me. 
In conclusion: fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. LOAN GROANZ ♦

We’re only running one diary this week, Ruby’s, because we’re too sad to edit the other ones right now. Minna, Dylan, Naomi, and Katherine will be back next week.
Ruby
My mother died last night. She was far away from us when it happened.
I don’t want to think about why.
She was in so much pain for so much of her life, and she stayed here for us until she couldn’t.
The last time I remember speaking to her was when she took us to Target. She was in a rush and wasn’t paying too much attention to me. The day before we had cried together and said we love each other. She said she loves me so much. I said I love her too. I hope she believed me.
She dropped us off at school on Monday. That’s the last time I saw her before she left us and then everything. I think I remember being mad at her and leaving without a word. My sister says that was on Friday, and that the last thing I said was goodbye.
I’m so sorry for acting like I hated her sometimes. She isn’t like anyone else and she understands me more than anyone.
We were so close and yet so distant. Is this a memory? Is this a dream?
I keep telling myself I’m going to wake up and she will be home. I was angry at her for leaving home until I heard she was gone forever. Now I don’t know what to think.
I feel empty. I feel like I can’t cry as much as I should. I don’t understand and it doesn’t feel real. My brother and sister cried, too. Of course they did. We all love her.
I searched her room, trying to find things that smelled like her. I needed to find something. I found her favorite coat—the same coat that led me to believe she would come back because I thought she would never leave without it. 
I don’t know if I can ever see anything the same way again.
“You write essays as good as David Sedaris,” she said in the car one time. She was saying I probably had ADD and was reassuring me that nothing was wrong with me. 
“You are perfect,” she has said countless times. She is perfect, but her problems sometimes overshadowed the real her. She’s perfect now.
I love you, Mom, and I’m so sorry that I didn’t act like it all the time. I love you. ♦

I’m a summer crusader, a SUNSHINE CHAMPION, and finally, my time has come. The beer is cold and homework is history, T. Rex is on rotation and I haven’t moved from this lawn chair in my backyard for a luxurious amount of time. As a certified child of summer, my season for living has begun. OHH YEAH (Kool-Aid voice).
I’m writing this entry amidst the wreckage of a recent throw-down, when all of us neighbors invited a few bands to play in our backyard for about 250 people. As I’m writing, the two kiddos who live in the dilapidated building next door are riding a unicycle around the yard while my friends who live on the second floor are grilling kebabs for all of us. Summer dreams are coming true.
A few weeks ago, as finals were wrapping up, things felt very, very different. After a lot of deliberation, I planned to stay in Oakland this summer: I can take summer classes here, and have access to a studio, and find a job. Little did I know, till last week, neither of my parents had any plans to pay for summer classes for me, though each expected the other to. (And I sure can’t pay for them myself, and I’m trying to avoid incurring even more loans.) These are the joys of navigating money and life between two divorced parents, once you get to college. The politics of the relationships you have with them will always be tricky, but as you get older, the issues you’re dealing with change. I often find myself trying to pin down stuff like who’s paying my tuition this semester, having confused or unmet expectations of who’s taking care of what, and being left to figure it all out on my own (and often being disappointed).
I figured if I couldn’t take classes in Oakland, there wasn’t really a point in my staying here, which kind of mucked up all my summer plans. I started to think that maybe I should just stay in Seattle, with my mom, after all. I got really bummed out when I thought about this, though, so I came up with a new plan: stay in Oakland, take workshops and cheaper classes not for credit, and still feel productive and purposeful. Just because I’m not getting school credit this summer doesn’t mean I can’t achieve all the other stuff I want.
Anyway, the SPIRIT of the SEASON is not about sticking to some static, perfectly executed plan. Summer magic comes from spontaneous fun, the warm air and everything fun you can do in it. Magic summer doesn’t come without tribulations, but I think despite my disappointments, this summer is gonna give me all the good stuff of life that I’ve been ready for since life began. ♦

Do you ever wonder when adolescence ends? I think it happens when you visit home for a couple of weeks after you finish your first half of college, and for the first time you see that everything else is moving on without you. By that criterion, my adolescence is on its way out.
I just learned that both of my parents are planning to move this summer. I never spent much time at my dad’s house, but my mom and I lived in her current place for all of my high school years. We lived there longer than in anywhere else we’ve lived. We moved around a lot—eight different places in Seattle alone—so I never thought I’d grow attached to any particular house. But when my mother said she was moving, I started to feel…wistful. I appreciated anew how close her house is to the neighborhood that was my teenage social epicenter, how I threw my first parties there, how I had to learn how to tough it out a little bit before the neighborhood totally gentrified. A lot of me happened in that house—most of the important parts. Tonight is my last night in Seattle, and probably my last night in this house, forever. So, I’m sad. I can’t pretend this house doesn’t mean a lot to me. 
I’m also noticing that my relationships with my parents are changing. My mother is dating a guy who I think is super great (plus his life goal is to be mentioned positively in one of my diary posts, so merry Christmas, dude!), and I’m really excited for her, but I’ll be real. I’ve spent the past five years of my life as an only child living with a single mom, so I’m used to having all her attention, getting to ramble on about my life and myself and everything else me me me listen listen! Now she has this busy social life with her boyfriend. She spend all of her free time with him, playing tennis and going to the market and eating dinner in restaurants. Sometimes they include me on these excursions, but I used to do all of these things with my mom, all the time, just me and her. So, changes! I’m glad, though, that she doesn’t have to do all that stuff alone when I’m away at school. 
Things are sort of changing with my dad, too. A few days ago I went out to dinner with him and he suggested that I “consider” what it would be like if he cut off half the money he gives me every month to pay my rent and bills. He didn’t say he was definitely going to do that, but just wanted me to give it a little thought, because maybe!!! Just think about it!! 
One of the biggest privileges I’ve had in life is that I get to go to college, and focus on college instead of having to work an extra 30 hours a week to support myself. I find ways to earn spending cash, but I’ve been well supported for the necessities of living away from my parents’ homes. So there’s another adolescent perk vanishing before my eyes—I no longer get to take for granted that I’ll be automatically fed and clothed and housed. But as much as I want to squirm and whine and proclaim, “DAD, I’m just a TEENAGER,” that won’t be true in three months, and he wants me to grow up and act like an adult, at least when it comes to money. 
I’ve been hanging out with my old crew in Seattle, and that forced me to face the end of my teen years, too. My old friends were all a few years older than me, so now they’re in their 20s and talk about stuff we never concerned ourselves with before: the tribulations of starting their careers, decisions about whether to move in with their significant others, and other things that have me trembling in my teenage boots because I’ll be facing all that stuff in a few short years. Those are going to be my problems. And it’s not just me growing up—it’s everyone around me, too. 
Adolescence lives in the place you grew up in, and next time I come home, everything is going to be different. It’s impossible go back to something that’s not there anymore. ♦

It wasn’t until I was 17 or 18 that I started to look my age. Before that, my curls and chubby cheeks made it simple for most people treat me like a baby. It didn’t help that I was the youngest person in my class, all the way through high school—that just sealed my fate as The Baby in any social situation, a role that can be pretty prohibiting. You can never be the sexy one or the super cool one or the incredibly interesting one if you are placed in the baby box.
There is, however, one big advantage to being The Baby—if you act the slightest bit smart or mature, you get to be one of those kids that adults call precocious. I used that impression to my advantage growing up. 
Before you reach legal adulthood, acting like a miniature grownup is the key to getting what you want in life, at least in my experience. That’s how I got to sell my handmade cards and headbands in stores when I was 12, got paying design jobs at 13, and snagged a fundraising internship when I was 15. Many adults set the bar low for teenagers: if you prove that you don’t fall into the unfortunately common stereotypes of lazy, disaffected, and unreliable Youth of Today, opportunities can arise. It’s always super satisfying to trump someone’s expectations of you, anyways. If you can prove that you don’t fit the preconceptions of kidlike irresponsibility or impatience or whatever old people despise about kids, then you’re officially precocious. Adults will think you’re GREAT. However, you can’t just be an old in a young body—you have to charm them with your youthful enthusiasm and charisma while you surprise them with your old-soul wisdom. It’s a delicate balance.
By the time I turned 18, I guess some combination of my looks changing a little bit (even though I still have blond curls and full cheeks) and my attitude maturing somewhat, too, made people start treating me my age. A lot of people I meet are even surprised that I’m not old enough to drink legally. Mostly I welcomed this change—I’m not automatically assigned the Baby role in every social group anymore—but it puts me on unfamiliar ground. I know how to play The Baby—it’s been my whole life. I knew what strings to pull to get what I wanted. But as far as being the CRAZY SEXY COOL ADULT PERSON OVER HERE, I don’t know how to pull it off. I’m not really that person yet. I don’t know what to do! No one will buy precocious from a soon-to-be-20-year-old. Adults are going to need reasons to love me as a fellow adult. I gotta learn a whole new arsenal of charming behaviors. 
How do adults get what they want, anyway? ♦

March was kind of a harsh month. Between getting attacked on the street, the situation with Crush Boy, the conflict with Crush Boy’s friend, and the faltering health of my dog (and best friend), I didn’t have the time of my life. But last week, things started to turn around. It was my first week back at school after a very busy spring break, and I kind of killed it. By last Friday, I was riding high on my own successes, having received an A on a paper and two surprisingly successful critiques that I had predicted would blow up in my face. One of the projects was for my mentorship class. It’s our only studio assignment all semester, so I felt pressure to produce the ~ultimate~ piece about who I am. It was called West Coast Social Suicide, and it combined my personal writing with hand-drawn typography in a large-format print exposing my feelings of social anxiety. I must have started it 10 different times, but I got a ton of positive feedback that I didn’t expect, which was a confidence boost to help me prepare for April, also known as “Holy shit, finals are starting!?!” month. 
I was sleep deprived but totally beside myself with excitement when my friend from home came to visit. Jo arrived just when I was starting to miss Seattle. We had a fun few days, cruising on bikes to find vintage stores, dancing at our friend’s hair-metal night, and talking shit over brunch. To add to the good times, our friends’ band from Seattle rolled through town, so there was an extra burst of familiar faces. That’s just the PINNACLE of happiness for me—the convergence of my Seattle and Bay Area social lives makes me feel like life is whole and beautiful.
But speaking of convergence, at the show, I spotted pretty much the only two people in my life that are complicated to run into: my ex-best friend and the dude I got in a fight with last week. Jo and I said hi to the girl I used to be friends with. I tried to have a conversation with her, but she interrupted and talked over me a lot, which reminded me that, yeah, she does that. I don’t like it! Then, after a couple of bands and a significant period of awkward avoidance, Crush Boy’s friend came up to me and apologized. Of course that made me feel like a total winner, but that’s not so wrong, is it? The guy still sketches me out, but at least he admitted his mistake. 
All of this happened over the birthday weekend of a certain former Crush Boy, which I purposely neglected. Again, small victories, but they give me a sense of satisfaction.
The week was full of positive little turns, which I appreciate now more than ever. I explored sadness in March, but maybe this signals a transformation in April (copyright Rookie, 2012). I’m trying really hard to keep up that momentum and glide into spring like a sugar glider, flyin’ through the sunshine.

WOOO, here I come. WHOA, there I go. ♦

I used to believe that becoming an adult was a slow and incremental process. You graduate from high school, life gradually piles on more responsibilities, and before you know it, you’re playing shuffleboard with your cronies as you’re wondering where your youth went (which I think is what happens when you’re 80?). But lately I’ve come to learn that adulthood doesn’t just happen over time: it’s a choice. You wake up one day and say to yourself, “Child, the TIME HAS COME,” and then go act like an adult. This is how it works, in reality.
I’m pretty lucky, because I get to choose when I’ll grow up, instead of being forced to do so by financial, emotional, or familial responsibilities before I’m ready. My time might be now, spurred by a decision I’m facing right this very moment: whether to stay in California for the summer, or go home to Seattle. 
When I started writing this diary entry, LO LIKE 30 MINUTES AGO, I thought it would be all about my awesome life in California. I was explaining how exciting and full of creative things it is, and how I was excited to spend the summer here. How I got an internship and registered for classes. How the choice to stay here instead of going home to my mom signified a turning point in my life, an important step in becoming a grownup.
I was almost done with the entry when my mom called. Coincidentally, she wanted to talk about my choice to stay in California for the summer. She told me that my not coming home puts her in an uncertain place, financially—she doesn’t get child support from my dad unless I am physically living with her, and without that money, she says, she can’t afford the mortgage on our house. Suddenly my decision on what I’m gonna do this summer isn’t just about me. By staying in California to keep the ball rolling on this whole growing-up thing, I’m forcing my mom to sacrifice a lot. But going home would mean my sacrificing a crucial summer of internships and studio use and taking advantage of the resources my school has to offer to work on my art projects. 
The thing about art school is, it’s not just going to college, and that’s it. School, or an art life in general, is full time; I have to completely live it if I’m going to be successful, make work that’s important to me, and be taken seriously. I wouldn’t be so dramatic about this if I didn’t think it was true: I believe staying here this summer is an enormous step in defining the rest of my life. It would prove (to myself more than anyone else) how serious I am about making art, finding a place for myself in the music scene, and making connections with new friends and collaborators (basically everything that’s important to me in my own selfish, individual interests).
Another complication: my dog’s health is deteriorating and I feel like I’m deserting him when he needs me most. It might be his last summer. It’s agonizingly sad, because I feel like by staying here I’m abandoning my family, but I know deep down that it’s the best thing for me. 
I told my mom that she can have me home for the financial security, but temporary financial comfort isn’t as consequential as my having to forego this big turning point in my life. I can move forward with what I have going, which is full of motivation and work and opportunities…or stall and lose all of my momentum by going home. 
After I got beat up last month I went to Seattle for a few days to recuperate. As I was leaving, my mom told me about a dream she’d had. In the dream there was a decapitated baby doll with a messed-up leg. Even though it didn’t have my face, it apparently was me. She was carrying the screwed-up Dylan doll around, telling the dream-people, “I have to bury my dad and my baby.” Her dad passed away around Christmas, so that made sense, but, uh, me? That’s pretty warped mind-stuff from my pretty untwisted mom. She asked her boyfriend to analyze the dream, and he said, “If Dylan doesn’t come home for the summer, you are burying your baby.” 
I know she’s not ready to let me go as a child without one final summer. I know that my dog really needs me, and he’s so important to me. I hate to sound selfish, but from my perspective, these are the two sides of the coin right now: I could come home, allowing my mom temporary financial breathing room while incurring permanent backtracking on my path to grownup land…or I could ask for her to hold out and sacrifice a little bit more for a little bit longer while I stay in California. Age 19 feels like mission-critical, once-in-a-lifetime stuff; if I lose time now, I’ll never get it back. But how self-interested am I allowed to be?
As Jack Black says, “Being a person is hard.”

Last week, I was cutting my friend Tania’s hair and, per the code of playing hairdresser, we decided to talk about LIFE. A shit-ton of LIFE was going on around me and I really didn’t know what to do about it. Coincidentally, identical life-stuff was happening to Tania, so we figured some things out together.
Tania and I are both from Seattle and both in that weird limbo between childhood and adulthood that’s called your late teens. The place where you suddenly have to choose between the comfort of your family and the excitement of making your way in the world on your own. Tania’s parents had recently come to visit her for the weekend, and after they left she bawled on the BART train, because saying goodbye to parents is sad (and crying on public transportation is when you know you’re really sad). “In San Francisco, I have everything I need for me to be happy,” she told me, “but when my parents come, it’s like the whole picture is complete. I have everything in one place.” I responded with one million amens. I wish I could have it all too: to stay a kid in my family and fly the coop to chase after my life dreams. But I have to make a decision.
This decision is particularly urgent right now, because, like I mentioned last week, I was planning to stay in California for the summer, working and making art, then my mom told me that she wants/needs me to spend the summer with her instead. In our haircutting focus zone, Tania and I talked about our guilt over growing up. It’s like, right now we’re deciding whether to look at our lives through the lens of being a family member or the lens of an individual. And we risk hurting some feelings. Do our families expect us to return to our hometown after we graduate? A lot of people I grew up with are in that situation. After college they’ll likely return to the town they grew up in, pick up their lives there, and keep on going that way. I could do that pretty easily, but since this is ME we’re talking about, there’s a lot I want to do outside of those boundaries. I have a lot of dreams about tearing shit up all around the world that will never happen if I stay within my known version of life that includes my mom and the Seattle scene I’m used to. I know growing out of the daughter role may come easily to some people…but those people might not be friends with their moms like I am. 
I’ll start my junior year of college this fall. I’ve already had two totally dismal summers at home waiting for school to start, when I was not productive or happy or very much fun. After two summers of fruitless creative employment and internship searches in my hometown that resulted in freelance jobs that weren’t very meaningful, I’m over it. I worked my ass off to find jobs in my areas of interest that never wanted me in Seattle, but here in Oakland, mostly because I have a network provided by my school, there is plenty of opportunity. That’s just the facts, for the specific kinds of things that I, specifically, am trying to accomplish. Seattle is settling. California is everything. That is the truth of my life, as it is, April 18, 2012. 
My mom called me again, later on last week. I hadn’t talked to her since she unloaded all of the heaviness with regard to my summer decision. She seemed a lot calmer this time; she assured me that, with a little shifting around, she’d be OK without my presence at home this summer. She’d have to rent our house to make up the difference financially, but she can find somewhere temporary and comfortable to live until she makes her next move. There’s also the possibility that I could take my dog Sammy down here for the summer, which would unload about half of the guilt about not being with my family this summer. And also, AHHH MY DOG WOULD BE HERE!!!
I was so tormented over my decision all week. Then I put it in perspective: my mother just got a new job that she’s happy with, she’s in a committed relationship, she’s fine. She’s totally fine. We’re both fine! Things have been exponentially worse before! In fact, in many ways, for both of us, this is the best it has ever been. My family is, for better and worse, pretty experienced at getting through spots of financial insecurity. Houses change (and have done so eight times), priorities get modified, responsibilities shift. I’ll take on even more of them. But we can deal with it, one more time. 
I know I can’t have everything, and that life isn’t meant to be complete when you’re 19. Everybody is sacrificing something here; and to create my autonomous life, I have to redefine my role as a daughter. You know how most of my diaries so far have been about how kickass my life is? And how HAPPY I am doing what I LOVE? Well, I was repressing some of the realities entailed by growing into that happiness, things I knew in the back of my mind but was scared to acknowledge, to you or myself. Living the dream still = LIVING, and living = LIFE, and LIFE = UNFAIR and HARD, sometimes. But these problems are side effects of dream-chasin’ and maturity-gainin’, and I don’t want to complain. Just to explain. It’s not easy. It can get very sad sometimes. I can’t fully live this life while maintaining my former one. Adapt and keep trying is all I can do. ♦

Last December, I was looking for a place to live after my time at the Starline art space ended. I found a mad cheap and gloriously restored Victorian fourplex with bay windows and high ceilings right across the street. After we snagged the best unit, I moved in with Kat, my roommate from freshman year, and Leah, whom I barely knew but now consider one of my best friends. We are living it UP in apartment three, which would be satisfying enough, but the stars aligned to give us the best bunch of neighbors possible.
The guy upstairs is so HAPPY and has so much ENERGY, and now we play tennis together on a weekly basis. That’s huge for me because I couldn’t find anyone to play with in Oakland until I spied a racket in his apartment. He has a dog named Phife that I usually walk once a week, which pays for our portion of the internet connection we share with him, and he doesn’t seem to care that a bunch of WiLd and CrAzY teenagers live below him.
We met our downstairs neighbor when she invited my roommates and me over for dinner, and we ended up drunk and doing karaoke knowing that (a) we never had to worry about making too much noise ever again, and (b) we had ourselves a new buddy. Her roommate hangs as hard as we do despite the fact that he’s a decade older.
Two of my female friends in the building are a couple, and they say they are married even though California doesn’t want to recognize that legally these days. They run a vegan food truck that delivers indescribably delicious meals. Another dude is building a screen-printing studio in our backyard this summer! One time, I asked him to go to a show when none of my other friends could come, and he was the MOST FUN companion ever. He found this gallery across the street that was giving out free beer, so he was shuttling the beer to me as I watched the music!
Here’s this almost ridiculously amazing cast of characters who are not only neighbors but total buddies. This weekend, all of my social activity resulted from knocking on their doors and spontaneously hanging out. Saturday night I came home and most of the girls in the building were around, so we made a fire pit in the backyard. As I was writing this, our friend came upstairs to borrow our living room for a scene in a movie that her friend is making this afternoon. We knock on each other’s doors at two AM all the time to see if people want to party (or that might just be me), borrow cups of sugar, walk each other’s dogs, the whole deal. 
Most memorably, when I came home from getting attacked, the entire building was in my kitchen in less than 60 seconds with Band-Aids and Neosporin and a phone to call the police. The morning after, the owners of the vegan truck brought me kumquat biscuits with kumquat jam, and they just made everything bad go away. There couldn’t have been a better substitute for my mom. (Maybe they were better than my mom because they were totally calm!) And a community has sprung from our friendship with one another.
This is like a revelation to me, after my only-childhood full of alone time and never knowing my neighbors, because we were moving almost every year. Over our backyard bonfire, we tried to discern which person in the building played each familial role. My roommates and I rep the little sisters, but things got kind of convoluted when we started assigning parental roles. We might see each other as peers too much to be able to look at each other that way. But see? We already consider each other a FAMILY! This has to be the best living situation in the world, and it’s mine. How can I make it last forever? ♦

March was kind of a harsh month. Between getting attacked on the street, the situation with Crush Boy, the conflict with Crush Boy’s friend, and the faltering health of my dog (and best friend), I didn’t have the time of my life. But last week, things started to turn around. It was my first week back at school after a very busy spring break, and I kind of killed it. By last Friday, I was riding high on my own successes, having received an A on a paper and two surprisingly successful critiques that I had predicted would blow up in my face. One of the projects was for my mentorship class. It’s our only studio assignment all semester, so I felt pressure to produce the ~ultimate~ piece about who I am. It was called West Coast Social Suicide, and it combined my personal writing with hand-drawn typography in a large-format print exposing my feelings of social anxiety. I must have started it 10 different times, but I got a ton of positive feedback that I didn’t expect, which was a confidence boost to help me prepare for April, also known as “Holy shit, finals are starting!?!” month. 
I was sleep deprived but totally beside myself with excitement when my friend from home came to visit. Jo arrived just when I was starting to miss Seattle. We had a fun few days, cruising on bikes to find vintage stores, dancing at our friend’s hair-metal night, and talking shit over brunch. To add to the good times, our friends’ band from Seattle rolled through town, so there was an extra burst of familiar faces. That’s just the PINNACLE of happiness for me—the convergence of my Seattle and Bay Area social lives makes me feel like life is whole and beautiful.
But speaking of convergence, at the show, I spotted pretty much the only two people in my life that are complicated to run into: my ex-best friend and the dude I got in a fight with last week. Jo and I said hi to the girl I used to be friends with. I tried to have a conversation with her, but she interrupted and talked over me a lot, which reminded me that, yeah, she does that. I don’t like it! Then, after a couple of bands and a significant period of awkward avoidance, Crush Boy’s friend came up to me and apologized. Of course that made me feel like a total winner, but that’s not so wrong, is it? The guy still sketches me out, but at least he admitted his mistake. 
All of this happened over the birthday weekend of a certain former Crush Boy, which I purposely neglected. Again, small victories, but they give me a sense of satisfaction.
The week was full of positive little turns, which I appreciate now more than ever. I explored sadness in March, but maybe this signals a transformation in April (copyright Rookie, 2012). I’m trying really hard to keep up that momentum and glide into spring like a sugar glider, flyin’ through the sunshine.

WOOO, here I come. WHOA, there I go. ♦

I used to believe that becoming an adult was a slow and incremental process. You graduate from high school, life gradually piles on more responsibilities, and before you know it, you’re playing shuffleboard with your cronies as you’re wondering where your youth went (which I think is what happens when you’re 80?). But lately I’ve come to learn that adulthood doesn’t just happen over time: it’s a choice. You wake up one day and say to yourself, “Child, the TIME HAS COME,” and then go act like an adult. This is how it works, in reality.
I’m pretty lucky, because I get to choose when I’ll grow up, instead of being forced to do so by financial, emotional, or familial responsibilities before I’m ready. My time might be now, spurred by a decision I’m facing right this very moment: whether to stay in California for the summer, or go home to Seattle. 
When I started writing this diary entry, LO LIKE 30 MINUTES AGO, I thought it would be all about my awesome life in California. I was explaining how exciting and full of creative things it is, and how I was excited to spend the summer here. How I got an internship and registered for classes. How the choice to stay here instead of going home to my mom signified a turning point in my life, an important step in becoming a grownup.
I was almost done with the entry when my mom called. Coincidentally, she wanted to talk about my choice to stay in California for the summer. She told me that my not coming home puts her in an uncertain place, financially—she doesn’t get child support from my dad unless I am physically living with her, and without that money, she says, she can’t afford the mortgage on our house. Suddenly my decision on what I’m gonna do this summer isn’t just about me. By staying in California to keep the ball rolling on this whole growing-up thing, I’m forcing my mom to sacrifice a lot. But going home would mean my sacrificing a crucial summer of internships and studio use and taking advantage of the resources my school has to offer to work on my art projects. 
The thing about art school is, it’s not just going to college, and that’s it. School, or an art life in general, is full time; I have to completely live it if I’m going to be successful, make work that’s important to me, and be taken seriously. I wouldn’t be so dramatic about this if I didn’t think it was true: I believe staying here this summer is an enormous step in defining the rest of my life. It would prove (to myself more than anyone else) how serious I am about making art, finding a place for myself in the music scene, and making connections with new friends and collaborators (basically everything that’s important to me in my own selfish, individual interests).
Another complication: my dog’s health is deteriorating and I feel like I’m deserting him when he needs me most. It might be his last summer. It’s agonizingly sad, because I feel like by staying here I’m abandoning my family, but I know deep down that it’s the best thing for me. 
I told my mom that she can have me home for the financial security, but temporary financial comfort isn’t as consequential as my having to forego this big turning point in my life. I can move forward with what I have going, which is full of motivation and work and opportunities…or stall and lose all of my momentum by going home. 
After I got beat up last month I went to Seattle for a few days to recuperate. As I was leaving, my mom told me about a dream she’d had. In the dream there was a decapitated baby doll with a messed-up leg. Even though it didn’t have my face, it apparently was me. She was carrying the screwed-up Dylan doll around, telling the dream-people, “I have to bury my dad and my baby.” Her dad passed away around Christmas, so that made sense, but, uh, me? That’s pretty warped mind-stuff from my pretty untwisted mom. She asked her boyfriend to analyze the dream, and he said, “If Dylan doesn’t come home for the summer, you are burying your baby.” 
I know she’s not ready to let me go as a child without one final summer. I know that my dog really needs me, and he’s so important to me. I hate to sound selfish, but from my perspective, these are the two sides of the coin right now: I could come home, allowing my mom temporary financial breathing room while incurring permanent backtracking on my path to grownup land…or I could ask for her to hold out and sacrifice a little bit more for a little bit longer while I stay in California. Age 19 feels like mission-critical, once-in-a-lifetime stuff; if I lose time now, I’ll never get it back. But how self-interested am I allowed to be?
As Jack Black says, “Being a person is hard.”

Last week, I was cutting my friend Tania’s hair and, per the code of playing hairdresser, we decided to talk about LIFE. A shit-ton of LIFE was going on around me and I really didn’t know what to do about it. Coincidentally, identical life-stuff was happening to Tania, so we figured some things out together.
Tania and I are both from Seattle and both in that weird limbo between childhood and adulthood that’s called your late teens. The place where you suddenly have to choose between the comfort of your family and the excitement of making your way in the world on your own. Tania’s parents had recently come to visit her for the weekend, and after they left she bawled on the BART train, because saying goodbye to parents is sad (and crying on public transportation is when you know you’re really sad). “In San Francisco, I have everything I need for me to be happy,” she told me, “but when my parents come, it’s like the whole picture is complete. I have everything in one place.” I responded with one million amens. I wish I could have it all too: to stay a kid in my family and fly the coop to chase after my life dreams. But I have to make a decision.
This decision is particularly urgent right now, because, like I mentioned last week, I was planning to stay in California for the summer, working and making art, then my mom told me that she wants/needs me to spend the summer with her instead. In our haircutting focus zone, Tania and I talked about our guilt over growing up. It’s like, right now we’re deciding whether to look at our lives through the lens of being a family member or the lens of an individual. And we risk hurting some feelings. Do our families expect us to return to our hometown after we graduate? A lot of people I grew up with are in that situation. After college they’ll likely return to the town they grew up in, pick up their lives there, and keep on going that way. I could do that pretty easily, but since this is ME we’re talking about, there’s a lot I want to do outside of those boundaries. I have a lot of dreams about tearing shit up all around the world that will never happen if I stay within my known version of life that includes my mom and the Seattle scene I’m used to. I know growing out of the daughter role may come easily to some people…but those people might not be friends with their moms like I am. 
I’ll start my junior year of college this fall. I’ve already had two totally dismal summers at home waiting for school to start, when I was not productive or happy or very much fun. After two summers of fruitless creative employment and internship searches in my hometown that resulted in freelance jobs that weren’t very meaningful, I’m over it. I worked my ass off to find jobs in my areas of interest that never wanted me in Seattle, but here in Oakland, mostly because I have a network provided by my school, there is plenty of opportunity. That’s just the facts, for the specific kinds of things that I, specifically, am trying to accomplish. Seattle is settling. California is everything. That is the truth of my life, as it is, April 18, 2012. 
My mom called me again, later on last week. I hadn’t talked to her since she unloaded all of the heaviness with regard to my summer decision. She seemed a lot calmer this time; she assured me that, with a little shifting around, she’d be OK without my presence at home this summer. She’d have to rent our house to make up the difference financially, but she can find somewhere temporary and comfortable to live until she makes her next move. There’s also the possibility that I could take my dog Sammy down here for the summer, which would unload about half of the guilt about not being with my family this summer. And also, AHHH MY DOG WOULD BE HERE!!!
I was so tormented over my decision all week. Then I put it in perspective: my mother just got a new job that she’s happy with, she’s in a committed relationship, she’s fine. She’s totally fine. We’re both fine! Things have been exponentially worse before! In fact, in many ways, for both of us, this is the best it has ever been. My family is, for better and worse, pretty experienced at getting through spots of financial insecurity. Houses change (and have done so eight times), priorities get modified, responsibilities shift. I’ll take on even more of them. But we can deal with it, one more time. 
I know I can’t have everything, and that life isn’t meant to be complete when you’re 19. Everybody is sacrificing something here; and to create my autonomous life, I have to redefine my role as a daughter. You know how most of my diaries so far have been about how kickass my life is? And how HAPPY I am doing what I LOVE? Well, I was repressing some of the realities entailed by growing into that happiness, things I knew in the back of my mind but was scared to acknowledge, to you or myself. Living the dream still = LIVING, and living = LIFE, and LIFE = UNFAIR and HARD, sometimes. But these problems are side effects of dream-chasin’ and maturity-gainin’, and I don’t want to complain. Just to explain. It’s not easy. It can get very sad sometimes. I can’t fully live this life while maintaining my former one. Adapt and keep trying is all I can do. ♦

Last December, I was looking for a place to live after my time at the Starline art space ended. I found a mad cheap and gloriously restored Victorian fourplex with bay windows and high ceilings right across the street. After we snagged the best unit, I moved in with Kat, my roommate from freshman year, and Leah, whom I barely knew but now consider one of my best friends. We are living it UP in apartment three, which would be satisfying enough, but the stars aligned to give us the best bunch of neighbors possible.
The guy upstairs is so HAPPY and has so much ENERGY, and now we play tennis together on a weekly basis. That’s huge for me because I couldn’t find anyone to play with in Oakland until I spied a racket in his apartment. He has a dog named Phife that I usually walk once a week, which pays for our portion of the internet connection we share with him, and he doesn’t seem to care that a bunch of WiLd and CrAzY teenagers live below him.
We met our downstairs neighbor when she invited my roommates and me over for dinner, and we ended up drunk and doing karaoke knowing that (a) we never had to worry about making too much noise ever again, and (b) we had ourselves a new buddy. Her roommate hangs as hard as we do despite the fact that he’s a decade older.
Two of my female friends in the building are a couple, and they say they are married even though California doesn’t want to recognize that legally these days. They run a vegan food truck that delivers indescribably delicious meals. Another dude is building a screen-printing studio in our backyard this summer! One time, I asked him to go to a show when none of my other friends could come, and he was the MOST FUN companion ever. He found this gallery across the street that was giving out free beer, so he was shuttling the beer to me as I watched the music!
Here’s this almost ridiculously amazing cast of characters who are not only neighbors but total buddies. This weekend, all of my social activity resulted from knocking on their doors and spontaneously hanging out. Saturday night I came home and most of the girls in the building were around, so we made a fire pit in the backyard. As I was writing this, our friend came upstairs to borrow our living room for a scene in a movie that her friend is making this afternoon. We knock on each other’s doors at two AM all the time to see if people want to party (or that might just be me), borrow cups of sugar, walk each other’s dogs, the whole deal. 
Most memorably, when I came home from getting attacked, the entire building was in my kitchen in less than 60 seconds with Band-Aids and Neosporin and a phone to call the police. The morning after, the owners of the vegan truck brought me kumquat biscuits with kumquat jam, and they just made everything bad go away. There couldn’t have been a better substitute for my mom. (Maybe they were better than my mom because they were totally calm!) And a community has sprung from our friendship with one another.
This is like a revelation to me, after my only-childhood full of alone time and never knowing my neighbors, because we were moving almost every year.

This has to be the best living situation in the world, and it’s mine. How can I make it last forever? ♦

This week’s title is “Some REAL DEEP Thoughts: Art and Life Edition!” For the thoughts that dominated my mindscape for the last seven days have been SUPER significant…about the meaning of LIFE and stuff! Not saying that I don’t normally ruminate over existential matters, or whatever, but this week things just seemed to click in some pretty beautiful ways. 
It began on Thursday, when I took an extended lunch break with Marc, my close friend/collaboration soulmate, and spontaneously launched into a multi-hour discussion session about why we’re doing what we’re doing in school, and what drives us creatively, what sort of lives we want to build for ourselves. We talked for so long we came back to class half an hour late, but with epiphanies swirling in our heads! 
We agreed that our strongest desire is to feel fully engaged in what we’re making, to give it our all, to never stop doing art-things. We both feel a need to dissolve the art/work/life boundaries so that we’re living in a zone of constant creativity. The happiest version of future-me couldn’t just have an “artistic occupation,” one that required me to just show up, work for a period of time, then peace out and spend the remainder of my time participating in the rest of life. A creative career—or, a creative existence—makes sense to me only when it is lived 24/7, as a lifestyle, not just a job. It’s all or nothing for me, and I want to give it my all. 
Articulating this with Marc was like discovering some sort of buried truth, making me wonder, what took me so long to be able to express that? Then, as I looked around at my life, I realized that I’ve surrounded myself with people who follow a similar credo—people who live their art, or whatever it is that they love. Literally, in this diary entry, I began to make a list of anyone I know that I feel this way about, but shit got long real quick, so I’ll spare everyone. People who are dedicated, who are constantly making and thinking and engaging on a creative level…those are my favorite. I want to be one of those.
This weekend held an especially special example. There’s a band from home that I’ve been friends with for years now, called Night Beats. It’s a particularly fun relationship because they can claim many of my very important firsts: my first time getting stoned, first time cruising to another town with a band to see their show, first band to crash on the floor of my first apartment when I had just moved out, and other important milestones of my youth. I consider them very special buddies in this way, so you may understand how exciting it was to have them roll into town to play a show last weekend. But this was no ordinary gig: they opened for Roky Erickson, of the 13th Floor Elevators, the band essentially credited with pioneering psychedelic music. They are VERY IMPORTANT!! Roky is without a doubt Night Beats’ collective lifetime idol, and most obvious musical influence, as their sound is fuzzy and psych-y and wonderfully appropriate for space-outs when you’re driving through the desert or something. I’m pretty sure opening for him was their ultimate dream come true. Seeing their names on the marquee made me buzz with pride all night long. They tour most of the year, traverse the country to record with other bands, and participate in as many festivals and happenings as they can manage. It’s their full-time life, this band. They live their music, their art, and look where that shit got them. It got them to dreamland! I want to go there! 
THE SHOW WAS SO MIND-BENDING AND EMOTIONALLY THRILLING THAT I DRUNK-TEXTED MY DAD ABOUT IT. I saw this song performed by the (now old) man who wrote it 50-some years ago…I mean!
I crave moments like that night, where it’s like I’m orbiting around these extraordinarily awesome people, creating and witnessing things and music and moments that are the stuff of magic. It’s possible that everything I do is an effort to fill my life with these moments, to create my place in this strange version of the world with its rock & roll and its art and its commitment to living creatively—to surround myself with everyone I can find who is inspiring and productive and doing something fantastic.
I have faith that my life can be lived for art. Watching my friends open for their hero in front of a sold-out audience was an affirmation that my faith isn’t entirely naïve or ridiculous. I’m going to throw in all the dedication I can muster to make this Magical Creative Life work. So far, it’s looking good. ♦

My life in gentrification nation has been a formative experience. From moving into a house with my mom in Seattle’s quickly transitioning, historically black neighborhood back in high school, to now living with my friends in a notoriously sketchy section of Oakland, I’ve experienced two areas of two different cities that are in the midst of socioeconomic transition. It’s obvious that I’m a part of it because I’m new here, and white, and I come from a middle-class family, and I think things like “I’m so happy my neighbors put the petunia planters here. I hope it will discourage the discarding of hypodermic needles!” 
There’s a lot of social complexity in neighborhoods undergoing gentrification, which are often characterized by fascinating but frequently awkward phases of tension between the lifelong residents and the people (such as me) who move in and, over time, alter the demographic. This is a BIG can of worms to open, but it’s a huge part of my adolescent experience, and speaks to how comfortable I feel in places that Girls Like Me (blondish, occasionally dressed like a kindergarten teacher) historically might not. But I worry I may have become too comfortable walking by myself late at night, too accustomed to daily life in somewhat questionable neighborhoods. Not that there was much I could do to change the situation I’m about to describe, but I guess that it was a wake-up call not to take my safety for granted.
At least a couple of times a week, I take the bus back from campus at either eight or 11 PM, then walk eight blocks through downtown Oakland to my apartment. I walk swiftly, with my pepper spray-equipped key ring in hand and my cell phone in my pocket, taking only busy, well-lit streets. On Monday of last week, I was only three blocks from home when a man stormed up to me, got in my face, and called me a “white bitch.” I tried to slip past him, responding, “Yep, you’re right.” Street harassment is common in every major city. Not reacting has worked for me in situations like this thus far. 
But as I tried to keep moving, the guy chest-bumped me and repeated his insult. As I fiddled with the switch on my pocket spray, I yelled, “Get OUT of my FACE!” I was almost done getting the safety switch off the thing when he did it again, pushing me backwards. Gathering all of my strength, I looked into his bloodshot eyes and told him to “get the FUCK off of me.” But I wasn’t quick enough, because he socked me in my left eye. It made me dizzy, though I remember hearing the group of people he was with collectively gasp in protest as he pushed me to the ground, where I fell on my right arm underneath the brightest street lamp on the block. I was in adrenalized-survival mode, struggling aggressively. Above all, I was feeling a mix of shock and the most extreme level of anger I have ever felt in my life. But what could I do? I protected my head to the best of my ability, but that left my back and neck exposed. He kicked me in the face and the back of the neck four or five times before one of the people with him got him off of me. They got into a car and sped around the corner, but he walked away on foot. I regained my vision and fuzzily focused in on my Mace, aimlessly spraying it in the air like it was Febreze. I screamed vengeful thoughts at him as he walked away, making sure he knew that there’s a special place in hell for people who randomly beat up girls. I vaguely remember threatening to make his eyes bleed. 
I looked around the block and saw only one dazed face, and I realized that my only witness was visibly cracked-out. No one was at the window of the drive-through across the street, nor the gas station on the next corner, so I called my roommate Leah and had her open the door for me as I stormed home, still on the phone with her, still screaming revenge at the attacker.
All of my neighbors in our complex came upstairs to help me clean up the cuts along my earlobe, scalp, knee, and elbows as I cried in a few bursts. They checked to see if the bleeding on my scalp would need stitches, and if I had a concussion. Fortunately, I didn’t have to go to the hospital. They called the police. I waited for three hours, but when they didn’t show, I eventually gave up and tried to go to sleep. It was three AM. The next day I skipped my first class, but woke up early anyway to call my mom. My neighbors made me kumquat biscuits and visited periodically. 
I was dizzy for much of the next week, and it was hard to write or hold a thought for a few days. Having people in my classes ask me about my developing black eye was helpful at first, because talking about it made me less anxious. Otherwise I would get too in-my-own-head, and forget to put the incident in perspective: my body was OK, save for the scratch on my cornea. I sort of pride myself on being the kind of person who can take things in stride. I told myself, “Let’s be real. This stuff happens to people. It is a thing that happened to you that will not change your life.” But, as I continued to take public transportation alone at night, I’d get uncontrollably anxious. My favorite activity—drinking with friends—made me more depressed than happy. 
Now I’m feeling OK again, and I’m waiting for my second chiropractic appointment and a meeting with a school counselor next week. I’ve mostly received comforting responses from the people in my life, but a couple of them suggested that I leave the area. Oh sure, I’ll go pay twice as much to live in San Francisco, which I love half as much. Some kids I know who live deeper in the hood viewed it as a rite of passage. Other people, such as my dad, told me to do something differently next time, or just avoid walking at night, because that is so possible. (Yeah, I should’ve pulled out the pepper spray sooner, and next time I go from peacefully walking home to bleeding on the ground in under 10 seconds, I’ll try to remember that!) 
Those responses have driven me nuts. It’s true, if I lived in a place that wasn’t experiencing growing pains, this wouldn’t be an everyday risk. It’s also true that my presence in Oakland is part of the mechanism of change. Gentrification is complex. It’s personal and political, and it’s associated with plenty of polarizing effects, both positive and negative. There’s only one thing I know for sure: there is no pure and perfect truth for the questions that arise regarding urban neighborhoods in transition. My incident does not define my experience of living here. The area between “right” and “wrong,” that’s where you can find me, loving my home and trying my best to live my magical life. ♦

I didn’t expect that I’d be able to come home for spring break, but my mom received her unemployment check last-minute that let us afford my plane ticket to Seattle on Sunday. 
There are two main reasons I’m here, and those are to reassure my mom that I’m OK after getting beat up, and to see my Sammy, my dog. He’s insanely important to me, and he’s not doing so well. His back legs have been operated on before, when he was seven, and now that he’s 13 he is really experiencing their limitations. Since I was last home over Christmas, he has gone from being able to accompany me on the mile-long stroll up and down the hill near my house to being barely able to walk around the block. In three months, things have changed in his shaggy terrier body that force me to realize that he isn’t forever. 
When I moved away for college, leaving my dog was by LIGHT YEARS the most difficult thing for me to do. Plenty of sad things have happened in my life, but that one took the prize for emotional intensity. I sobbed for hours, two days in a row, before I packed the car for my California move. I think moving away forced me to recognize prematurely the impermanence of my childhood pet, my sibling-replacement and best friend. His quick transition into old-manhood is less distressing than it might have been had I not been forced to say goodbye to him once already. I can accept where he is now, and enjoy the time I get to spend with him, knowing that it means a lot for both of us. Sammy defines so much of my childhood that his waning health indicates the fading of my early years. 
In addition to the general shittiness of the week following my attack, my divorced parents were in the midst of a long argument about what’s best for Sammy, and I was on the receiving end of all the updates. My mom’s house, where I live when I’m not at school, is a skinny unit up two huge flights of stairs, which are now fully impossible for Sammy to tackle. My dad, on the other hand, rents a room from a sweet older woman in a house with a very limited amount of stairs. My dad is set on convincing my mom that Sammy is OK, and that he takes such good care of him, so she must be doing something wrong since he isn’t doing well at her place…but then he says he won’t let Sammy live with him. My mom just started a new job that requires her to cross town and be gone for 10 hours a day, so she just can’t take care of my dog. 
I’m SO effing sick of thinking about this whole conundrum between my parents over Sammy, but my being home with my mom is in a way a relief, because I get to see first-hand what’s going on with him, instead of trying to discern the truth between my parents’ opposing observations. Here’s the truth: my mom wasn’t exaggerating. Sammy’s not doing so well. 
This whole debacle with my dad trying to convince me my mom’s making shit up, and my mom dramatically announcing sad news about how Sammy fell down the stairs the other day, is happening the week I’m trying to get my mind together after getting randomly punched on the street. The last thing I wanted to do was to be in the middle of all of this to have to be sad about yet another thing. I told them that all I wanted was what would be the most comfortable arrangement for Sammy, and that if they don’t do something comfortable for him soon, I’m taking him with me back to California. I know that wouldn’t be ideal for him, as there are also a lot of stairs at my apartment, but at least he’d be with me. 
For now, I’m in Seattle for a couple more nights, and I get to be with the little old guy. I can tell he’s not in the happiest place. We’ve both gone through some shit the last couple of weeks, and being together is helping both of us. I’m trying to remind him that it’s OK to get old and that he shouldn’t feel bad about it, and he’s reminding me that I’m OK after everything that’s happened. Simply by being in the same room together, we’re reassuring each other about life, because that’s what best friends do. ♦

When Crush Boy left for his band’s tour, we didn’t stay in touch. So, when I texted him the night after I was attacked, it was the first time in weeks. I asked, “Are you awake?” He responded that he was about to pass out, and then I told him that I was trying to stay awake for the police to show up, due to the fact that I “basically just got jumped.” I waited a little bit longer for the police to show, then got too tired and gave up.
The next morning, I check my phone: nothing. No texts back. Waited a day, sent him a “hey” on Facebook chat: nothing. I waited a couple of days to text him that I was bummed he didn’t respond when I told him I’d been assaulted. Still: nothing. And that feeling SUCKED, for a few days. I just wanted him to acknowledge it; I wasn’t asking him to play a major role in my process of recovery, which is what I think he was afraid of, which is why he didn’t respond. But still, nothing at all? Not even a “What happened?”? Pretty shitty, but that’s just my opinion. It signaled an end for me; I realized that I can’t really deal with a totally noncommittal relationship with someone I have feelings for. 
SO, fast-forward to last weekend. My friend Leah and I were at a show and saw a guy we know, who also happens to know CB, and we made plans to hang out after the show. I had absolutely no expectations to discuss Crush Boy in any way, and was successful in avoiding the subject all night. Well…at least until we got tacos. TACOS changed everything.
I don’t remember how, but someone brought up Crush Boy in our conversation, which led me to say that I hadn’t been talking to him because I was bummed about his non-response to the news of my attack. First, our mutual acquaintance tried to posit that maybe CB’s phone was dead, which I pointed out couldn’t be true for multiple reasons. Then he launched into this aggressive argument about how he never even knew that CB and I were really a thing at all, and since we weren’t physically in the same city, why would he be thinking of me when he’s on tour anyway? He told me I was flat-out WRONG to expect anything of CB while he was wrapped up in his little tour universe.
At this point, Leah, a badass who is always down to stick up for me, got pissed. She told this dude that my attack was no small deal, as she was the first one to see me with blood dripping down my scalp and all, and that she thought CB played a shitty move by ignoring this. “I could have easily been curb-stomped into submission. It could have been a deadly situation, and I was lucky he was stopped. Maybe I could have died,” I explained. This guy then launched into a freaking tirade:
“Well, you didn’t die. I mean, I’m sorry that happened to you, but now you’re just victimizing yourself. You should know what you’re getting into by moving into that neighborhood.” He said that over and over again, that “victimizing” line. 
I attempted to explain that I wasn’t trying to play a victim card; I was just talking about something that made me feel bad in a relationship. I told him that my time with CB was an experiment in my young, little life to see if I could be involved with someone I had legitimate feelings for in a totally noncommittal way, because he’s in a band that tours half the year. Now I’m realizing that I can’t do it if the person I care about doesn’t care for me. 
Ooh, did this guy POUNCE on the fact I said “experiment.” 
“Oh, so he’s just an experiment to you? Oh, I bet he’d be so happy to hear that!” Let me point out that this guy was sober, when the rest of us weren’t. This kind of asshole rhetoric is something I’d expect from someone so drunk that they turn mean. “First you’re victimizing yourself over this whole situation, and now you’re telling me he’s just an experiment to you? I don’t need this, I’m leaving.” He got up from the table and started to go, but I realized my jacket was in his car. Leah and I walked outside to get it.
There was a group of creepy drunk men on the corner who were trying to holler at Leah and me—you know, “Heeey ladies, where are you going? What are you doing later?”
This dude we’d been talking to shouts at them, “You can HAVE THEM.”
That’s when Leah and I just turned on our heels in utter shock and gave him a huge, double “fuck you.” It was awesome; I wish I could do that a million more times. After I grabbed my jacket out of his car, he dramatically sped away. If his mission was to make me feel like shit, he really gave it a remarkable effort, but did not succeed. Instead, he proved himself to be the world’s biggest asshole. Congratulations, dude, you won! ♦

There’s a lot that my Crush Boy doesn’t know about me, and I’m starting to get anxious about it. I tried something new when I started hanging out with him. As you may have noticed by now, I love to tell anyone who will lend an ear EVERYTHING about my life ALL THE TIME, but with him, I put that habit aside. I wanted to be quiet and let him discover my world instead of me just telling him about it. The details of life would follow the more we got to know each other. 
That was a nice thought and all, but lately, I think it’s coming back to bite me in the ass. I feel like he knows nothing about me. Here’s a shitty thought that’s been floating around in my head: is he chill with having me around his friends? Does he think that I can’t keep up? The other night, we were texting when I was at a show with a band that he’s buddies with. I was stoked to be at that show&#8212about four beers stoked&#8212but was disappointed that he didn’t make it out. I was thinking about how he and I met at a house party, yet ever since, we’ve just hung out solo, mostly at home. I texted him, “Isn’t it weird that we haven’t really partied together?” I think of every other boy that’s been important in my tiny world, whether it turned into something or not, and it’s always been through parties or going to shows or the like. Those relationships existed in the public nighttime world, but with this Crush Boy, our relationship lives in my bedroom. It makes me nervous: maybe “we” don’t even exist at all outside of my room. Maybe it’s not a part of outside reality. 
I’m no stranger to worlds like his, but I feel like he assumes otherwise. He texted me back, saying, “We don’t party the same way. What do you mean by party?” I’ll be honest, he’s definitely more into drugs than I ever plan to be. I’m comfortable with that fact, because that’s nothing new to me or the people I hang around with. It’s so frustrating because I’m like, You’re not the first kid I know in a rock & roll band. I know how it works with dudes who are on the road for half of the year. I KNOW WHAT I’M DOING! As I rummaged for an appropriate response, I asked my friend, “How do I say, ‘Bitch, you don’t know me’ without, you know, sounding insane?” After being unable to come up with an appropriate answer, I dropped it and just didn’t text back. 
I wondered if I was even still into him. 
A thought even came into my head: I can’t have boys stick around for more than a certain amount of time before I lose interest, but…WHAT THE HELL?! With this one? No way. Previous dudes I knew had an expiration date because they were just all right. But Crush Boy is a little bit more than just all right. He kind of rules. And you know what? I fucking rule, too! I just feel like I haven’t really introduced myself to him yet. ♦

My best friend from high school lives 20 minutes away from me, right across the Bay. I don’t really know what she’s up to over there, and I don’t care to speculate. We don’t hang out anymore. But she was on my mind a lot this week.
We met at a Lashes show when I was in eighth grade and she was in ninth, and we bonded over loving plastic fake-Chanel jewelry and record stores. Then we ended up going to the same all-girls high school and got really close really fast. We liked to stake out the art room and bring in our friend’s band’s CD to play over lunch to make all of our other friends jealous of our juvenile adventures in rock & roll land. We often wore matching outfits without meaning to. I loved having a buddy to share my crazy teenage exploits; I felt like I grew up with her by my side. In hindsight, though, it was more that I was always by hers. As the younger, less experienced one I often felt like more of a sidekick than an equal partner.
This is how it ended, the short story. It’s from my side, but she’s never offered me hers: I moved to Oakland this time last year, and for months leading up to the move we talked excitedly about our imminent reunion. My first weekend in town, we hung out, getting drunk at a show and going shopping in the afternoon, just like we used to do in high school. That weekend, she made a passing remark about not wanting me to encroach on her social circle—she said she wanted me to be able to make my own friends. Valid concern, I guess, but that’s usually not how it works when your best friend moves to your city. 
Then she kind of disappeared, neglecting promises about visiting me at my new place, in my new life. I was so excited to show her. Yet she stopped returning my calls and never responded to any of my invitations. After two months of disregard I ran into her at a mutual friend’s concert. She was so high that we couldn’t even hold a conversation. I called her a week later and she didn’t pick up, so I left a pitifully tearful message asking her what I’d done wrong—what horrible thing had warranted a completely unexplained cold-turkey dumping a month after I moved 20 minutes away from her?? She texted me back, stating that she didn’t know why I was so angry, and that maybe if I could calm down we could work it out. She didn’t respond to anything from me after that, so I had to let things go. That was hard. 
I knew that my expectations of best-friendship weren’t unusual or unfair, and I knew that I hadn’t done anything wrong except try to continue my relationship with my best friend. So for all of the days that have passed since then, I’ve had to accept the awful truth: my best friend didn’t want me anymore.
Breaking up with your best friend is something you never really expect, because it never really has to happen. When it happens the very month you move to her city, when you thought she’d be happy to have you there and you’d hang out all the time and share your lives and puppies and rainbows etc…that’s difficult shit to get over. 
Now, since we’ve ceased to be friends, there’s a gap by my side where I’m used to having someone. I may be an independent thinker, doer, go-getter, in other parts of life (like school or work or feeling good about myself), but I really need a sidekick for my social life. Sure, I have a handful of friends here who go to parties and shows and galleries with me—in fact, they’re the most genuinely life-filled and sweet people I’ve ever, ever met—but they still don’t fill that gap. I need someone who wants to seek out the same sort of rock & roll adventure-land times that the ex-best-friend and I used to share. Without her, I feel like I’m floating in this new city without an anchor. 
When we were going through high school together, we were eager teenagers navigating the nuances of a world older and more exciting than ours, as a joint effort. As a team. I miss that. ♦

Crush Boy disappointed me again over the weekend. Some of my friends from Seattle were in town to play a show (with Crush Boy’s band, incidentally). I invited CB to a little afterparty at my apartment, and he said he would come, and I was really excited to spend time with him around people I’ve known for years. The party was shaping up to be just what I wanted/needed: a return to the familiar, playing music and taking pictures and stuff with this group of dudes I’ve known since my teenage years. I couldn’t wait to hold out my hand and show the boy, like, “This is what I’m used to. Please understand my life now.”
But guess what? He didn’t show. I was drunkenly upset about it, so naturally I was super bratty to him in texts. Definitely included a “so just, fuck you, OK?” in one of them. Whoops! Bad! Didn’t mean it!
Fortunately, when I apologized the next morning, he laughed it off, and we made plans to hang out after my friends left town. That was just the other night, and this time, he didn’t flake. It was my favorite night I have had with him, ever. We just chilled out and worked on stuff; I drew in my sketchbook and he tried to pin down the chorus for a song he was writing. There was a lot less tension and nervousness between us, because I wasn’t trying so hard to show him what I’m “really like.” And, to be completely honest, it may have been the first night we’ve spent together where we didn’t get stoned! So, you know, I could actually speak English coherently. He asked me to tell him stories. I told him some about my hometown, Seattle, and some recent ones too. It was really real and it felt good.
But THEN: Valentine’s Day rolls around. I strongly prefer to celebrate February 15: National Half-Price Candy Day. So I didn’t really need much from him on the official holiday. Plus, after some incidents of flaking out on his part, I figured it would be safer not to expect too much. But he sent me a sweet text, which maybe surprised me more than it should have. 
Last night, his band was playing at a dive bar across the street from my apartment. I got drunk with some friends and went to the show, and it was so much fun. At one point I was sitting at the bar with a friend, and CB came up with a buddy of his and introduced us. A few minutes later, I overheard CB whisper to his pal, “I didn’t expect to be in this sort of situation right now.” I can’t help wondering if that had something to do with me—when you tour half the year, as CB’s band does, you don’t really plan on having a steady girlfriend. Maybe I’m an unexpected situation for him. A good one. As they walked away, I could see them both looking back at me.
After the show we partied at my place, and I overheard CB asking his friend what he thought of me. In our place/age/social scene, where no one dates but everyone hooks up, I took this as a good sign. He wouldn’t really care what his buds thought of a girl he was just sleeping with, right? So maybe this is something bigger than that.
Happy Half-Price Candy Day. ♦

Yo, everybody, listen up. It’s my mom’s BIRTHDAY on Sunday! WOOOO! I consider my birthday to be the most important holiday of the year, but without my mom’s birthday, mine wouldn’t even be on the calendar, so according to the laws of transitive property (I have no clue what I’m talking about), February 26 is also a day of deep significance. And now, in honor of that great day, I have a special message to my mother:
Mom, first of all, I’m sorry for being a pill when I was 17! While I consider it the most fun year of my life, it was also the brattiest. You may remember (OK, you will definitely remember) that one night over Christmas when you had to pick me up from a party at three AM after I decided to “test my limits.” I spent the next day on the couch, nursing myself back to life via ginger ale and Happy Feet in an attempt to reclaim my innocence, and you came downstairs and made fun of me for watching Happy Feet as a way to reclaim my innocence. That year I partied a lot more than ever before. I snuck around every weekend, drinking beer and gaining weight. I blamed it on the jar of fresh granola that you made and kept on the counter, just out there asking me to eat it 24/7, but that’s not why I gained weight. I gained weight because I turned my insides into a beer aquarium, duh! Your granola is really good, and it’s healthier than beer. It has fiber. Beer just has bubbles. 
Thank you for paying for stuff. Thank you for always having prosciutto in the fridge. Thanks for teaching me how to cook when I was basically still an infant. Thank you for giving me small portions of coffee and wine at the table since I was eight, telling me that I’d be like a little French girl. 
Thanks for performing the general task of passing down what I consider motherly traits, like dressing nicely, creating a well-designed home, and being a good hostess. I’m the only person my age who polishes silver for parties and, like, serves people. And because I was raised by you, I’m pretty consistently overdressed for all occasions, which is cool. Thanks for encouraging my creative potential, which I got from you and which you got from your father. It’s nice having a parent who thinks being creative is THE most viable career path for me, and wasn’t all “[Garble garble] art school is for losers.” That’s real talk!
The BIGGEST thanks is for giving me so many hilarious stories to retell, the ones that me and my friends call “Oh, Janet” stories because, well, you know, OH, JANET. I like to tell the one about when we went down to Portland last summer. During this really fancy dinner, I was describing to you how I fall asleep sometimes during lectures and you looked at me and said, “Dylan, I’ve had that problem my whole life, too. I’ve always suspected I’ve had narcoleptica.” Yeah, that one disease that makes you fall asleep all of the time? Definitely called narcoleptica. Oh, Janet.
Now that I’ve fully exposed how hilarious and great you are, here’s a little jam by the Shaggs to celebrate. Think of it as a replacement for the cake that I won’t be able to make you because I’m not there this year. I know it’s nowhere near as good as the song you wrote that you like to sing to me whenever I’m pissed off at you, the one that goes, “I am awesome/ You are so lucky that you have me as a mom!” But happy birthday, Mom!

Sometimes I hate myself for feeling a certain way. Like: god, I’m so frustrated that I’m still mad at so-and-so for flaking out on plans. Or: I hate myself for hating the way I look today. Clearly, that pattern doesn’t get me anywhere; it just gives me another negative emotion to deal with on top of the original one. So 2012 is all about getting over that, and not apologizing to anyone about the way I feel! Because otherwise I will die alone in a beige land of numbness because I was too embarrassed to acknowledge what it’s like to be a sentient being. But, there’s a problem. Right now I think I do owe the world, and specific people contained therein, an apology for my feelings, or lack thereof. 
My mom’s dad died last week, a few days after Christmas. He was 94, and is the perfect example of the live-every-day-like-it’s-your-last ethos. He was just loud. Always belting Sinatra songs, making old-man hurrumphs when he wanted attention, and punctuating every other moment with proclamations of gratitude about how awesome his life was. When he would visit us every Thanksgiving in Seattle, I’d take him to my all-girls Catholic school for a tour, and he would hit on the nuns and the underage students alike. He kissed a lot of my friends’ hands. Everywhere he went, he made a show of himself and a friend of any stranger. He was a social fixture in Kansas City, where he lived most of his life and raised my mom and her sisters. We all called him Papa, and he was a pretty dope grandfather, who is now gone.
Papa was put in hospice care right before Christmas; we knew it was coming. My mom and I talked to (well, at) him on the phone an hour before he died. His death happened the day before my second annual After Christmas Blues Party, an idea I stole directly from Papa. He used to have these big open houses every year after Christmas (which now my mom says were her idea, all right Mom), which of course were torture for my cousins and me when we were younger—they were essentially conventions for local adults seeking to pinch our cheeks. But now that I’m older, wiser, and obviously more awesome, I thought it was a great idea to appropriate, and given my mom’s somewhat recent approval about my general party habits, why not have it at her classy little townhouse in the middle of the city! The party was quite a success, with 50 buddies stopping by to flick cigarette butts into my yard and accidentally drink my mom’s champagne from the fridge. It also felt like a perfect way for me to honor Papa’s memory. I’m not into the whole all-black-wearing mourning tradition; I’d rather celebrate life. And considering that Papa died in basically the ideal way—after a long, happy life, in his sleep, surrounded by loved ones—it didn’t seem appropriate to be all morose about it.
But: I feel like I’m being less than honest. Like I’m rationalizing my insensitivity and disguising it as a well-considered joie de vivre and a superior take on death and mourning. I think my outlook of “Oh, he was really old, he had a great life, IT’S ALL OK” might be a strategy I’ve adopted to keep from feeling sad. And now I feel guilty for not being sad.
My mom, for the first few days after Papa’s death, would have little random bursts of crying. I’m pretty terrible at comforting people (getting better with my peers, but comforting people older than me feels really awkward…why?), so I’d just nod my head and be like, “Yeah, Mom…it’s sad.” Then she asked me if I ever even felt like crying. Shit! I should be crying! 
What’s really going on is that I’m distracted. I’m unbreakably obsessed about returning to California after winter break. How selfish do I sound right now? I can’t help it, and I’m sorry about it. I left my sense of life back at college, and it’s all I can think about. Not to mention that my crush boy is going to be back in town upon my return, and thoughts of seeing him have taken up a lot of brain space. God, am I really so selfish that thoughts of a cute long-haired boy override my sadness over the death of my grandfather?
I know I’ll be sad at the funeral, when I’m immersed in the moment of it. But for now I can’t stop wanting to be back in MY own apartment, doing MY own things. My feelings distribution is jacked right now. I wish I could feel the feelings that this moment in my life is calling for. But all I can think about is my apartment, my friends that I miss, the feeling I get when I wake up and have the entire day open to me and no one else. And I’m so, so sorry. ♦

Seattle weather is the fucking pits. The skies are gray and the cloud-dampened daylight lasts about seven hours. Compared with the Bay Area, where you can lay out in the park in January, coming home feels like a major step back. It’s really hard for me to find the initiative to work on a project, or walk my dog, or, like, get out of bed when there’s no sun to warm my face. I don’t want to do shit when I’m home. I wish that I wanted to, but I don’t.
Honestly, it’s convenient to blame the weather. My psychology is weird when I’m here on a holiday break. The kid I used to be tromped around the city, spending entire days downtown, and never cooped herself up. I used to be mystified by my friends’ hibernation habits. Who would ever want to stay in and do nothing all day? Turns out: I do. 
In my head, I’d always choose being out and about over being comfy. My first words were “go places.” Proof! Anyway, hibernating, or whatever you want to call it, has been the pattern during my last few extended stays at home. Whether it was the rain or the lack of routine or the simplicity of being at my mom’s house, there’s something that happens in my head that turns the switch from “Let’s go out all the time!” into “Just text them and tell them you’re too tired…” It’s like I magically got lame one day, like something inside of me gently coaxed, “Yes, Dylan, waste your life away in your beautiful hometown. That sounds nice.” Whatever that something is, it’s lame! It’s given me a couple of summer and winter breaks where my habits are comparable to a bear’s.
I’m writing this on my last night here. I’m about 30 minutes away from going to my friend’s show at a venue down the street and I’m planning on partying all night to say goodbye to my city. At least I’m doing something today, although it makes me feel even more as if I wasted all these weeks here. ♦

Last week I had to shift gears from my formative Seattle home, to my childhood hometown of Kansas City, and then back to Oakland adult-land. It was a crazy whirlwind. It was hard. It dried me out.
This was partly because lot of unusual stuff went down while I was bouncing around those three cities. In Seattle, the night before I left, I decided to party the hardest I had all winter break, which led to a drunk/unintentional hookup with a friend whom I previously considered to be brother/buddy status (it was weird). I got home from his place at 6 AM, packed, showered, and headed out to the airport, then, after a four-hour flight, unslept and hung over, I reunited with my extended family back in Kansas City. The funeral for my Papa was the next day. I didn’t drop a tear until the moment I went up to the podium, gazed at a couple hundred people gathered to pay their respects, and cracked and choked my way through my reading (a piece my mom found from this daily spiritual thing she reads). The day after that, as it snowed in Kansas City, I finally headed back to Oakland, the place I’d been pining for throughout my break. I reunited with my crush boy that night, but I was drained. Not feeling like myself. When we met up the next day I was still zapped, and felt bad on top of it for being so out of it while finally getting to see him again. I was just blank for a few days, overwhelmed…but I couldn’t figure out exactly why.
I get a lot of my personal confidence from feeling comfortable in my surroundings. I love Oakland, my new place, because it’s all potential. There are no dashed hopes there, and no disappointments. But there are also no roots, those anchors that take time to grow. Seattle is where my social roots are, Kansas City, my family ones. I can return to any of those places on my own time and feel like I’m home. In Seattle, I know the lay of the land. I know what neighborhoods to go to, what bands are around, the people in those bands, and other necessary data that make me feel like part of the place. All of this took my whole teen years to cultivate. It trips me up that I’ll have to go through that whole process again in Oakland. I’ve been here almost a year now, but I still feel like I’m starting from scratch in this town. It sometimes feels uncomfortable, because I’m literally out of my comfort zone. But when I get that temptation to go back to the comfort of Seattle, I remind myself that “comfortable” isn’t synonymous with “happy.” I know that this is where I’m supposed to be right now, and soon it will feel right. ♦

As an only child, and someone who’s lived more or less by myself for half of my college life so far, I’ve always been somewhat on my own. I’ve tended to pick living spaces where I could hole up and cry while listening to Elliott Smith and drinking beer by myself. These situations didn’t feel very social or college-y. They felt more like adolescent bedroom angst part II. But I think my solitary days are over.
I’ve just moved in with two rad ladies: my friend Kat from school and her friend Leah, whom I didn’t know that well before we moved in together. But getting to know her has been so fun. Like, tonight, I was driving us home in her car (she was wasted; but also, I am honored that she trusted me), and we started belting Death Cab together for a few miles, half laughing, half crying all the while. I was like, Whoa, I can feel like I’m 14 right now by listening to the Sad Songs Of My Youth and it’s not just me alone in my bedroom? Someone else does this, too?
This is the first time I’ve lived with a peer. One that has some of my same feelings that I thought were only mine. Actually, two peers. Feeling like I’m not by myself all the time is a new feeling, one that I’m feeling more and more often as I get farther from my childhood and deeper into my college years and stuff.
The bummer of the week is that Crush Boy times have been strange. We haven’t met up in six days. He was supposed to come over tonight. That’s why I’m writing this now, to distract me from the fact that it’s one in the morning, I just got home from a party, and he didn’t come over like he asked to earlier. This is the second time this week he’s flaked out on me. I’m trying to cut him the appropriate amount of slack because he doesn’t have a car, and the train here stops running pretty early. But when I get excited that a boy I have a crush on is about to come over, that’s what my night becomes about. It changes my mood, duh. Then when he doesn’t, it’s a huge letdown, and I wonder how he ended up with the power in this relationship. I’m used to having the upper hand in boy times, I guess because the boys I’ve had those times with in the past have liked me more than I liked them.
I really like this new crush. I’m upfront about these things, straightforward. I don’t play games. But now he has enough power over me to bum me out when he doesn’t come over, and that’s enough for me to recognize that I have to get my shit together and regain some control. Otherwise, I’ll judge myself for being needy or too involved or putting too much into something that may not exist. But I know there’s something there, which is why flaking moments can really mean something. (They mean BUMMER.)
But you know what is making me feel powerful? School, which just started, and every class is absolutely magical. At school, I feel totally in control of my future happiness. When I first got to college I was all about professional development, but now I’m seeing how many opportunities art school is giving me to figure out my own personal creative vision, and I want to take advantage of that. Basically, I’m ruling school and making it work for ME. So let’s do this thing, spring semester 2012. It’s good to be back in California. ♦
