Britney
1. The worst words I have ever heard in my entire life: “Britney, your mother passed away.” I don’t think I have to elaborate on the fact that out of every single thing anyone has ever said to me, those hit me the hardest—a sudden blow that knocked out my knees and birthed a dull ache that spread across my body in a matter of seconds. 
2. I can’t remember the last time I came home and my mother was in motion, walking around, cooking, poking her head around the corner to say hi and to watch me take my shoes off; or knowing that in a few moments, I would come over to her and hug her. I can’t remember opening the door and seeing her smile or hearing her tell me that I was home early. I can’t remember the full effect of feeling her smile land on me.
3. I couldn’t even hold it together on Thanksgiving. I don’t know what I’ll do on her birthday (December 12th), on Christmas, on the 16th birthday that I was supposed to spend with her. I feel the weight of a thousand future moments that we will never share together and try not to cave in on myself. I try not to think about the fact that there are more than a thousand that we will never have together because just the idea of one is hurtful enough.
4. Everyone tells me, “You will get better but you will always feel sad.” This is not comforting, as you might imagine. All I’ve learned is that there is too much loss in the world, and that I am destined to always carry this sadness around like a ball and chain that will exist even when I am happy.
5. I am jealous of Past Me, the one whose worries were limited to staying up late and homework. I am jealous of all of my friends who can go home to their parents and talk about them with an air of carelessness, who don’t have to worry about the fact that the apartment they grew up in will be gone in less than a month, and who don’t know who their new legal guardian will be because there is no one they are content with. I am jealous of my friends who are hanging out and going on dates and don’t have to bury their best friend, the one person they could safely say they loved more than anything or anyone else.
6. I’m afraid of death, and I have been for years. Every time I think the words, The next time I see my mom, I will be dead, I get incredibly terrified, and I should probably go see someone about it because this one sentence repeats itself in my mind daily. (Another thing: What if for some reason I don’t see my mom after I die? What if I do something stupid in life and ruin all chances of that? Why should I even have to think about this? I shouldn’t.)
7. There are so many things I should say but I can’t. I don’t know anymore! I really don’t know! I don’t know! ♦
Britney
I’ve never felt so in love with someone, and I’m in love with that feeling in turn. One of my best friends/my ex-girlfriend and I are not back together, but we’re also not just friends, and a huge part of me is relieved. The part of me that is still sad and reeling from the loss of my mother feels clingy, in a sense, and won’t allow me to stop thinking about my friend. I hate that, but more than anything, I can’t believe that any of this is happening. Long story short, we both realized that we are still in love with each other, no matter how hard either of us tried not to be, and now we’re moving forward based on that. My mind replays moments from the past few days: watching her breathe when I couldn’t fall asleep, talking to her until the haziness of early morning consumed me, waking up with her arm slung over me, hearing the sound of her voice. The simplest things carry loads of meaning. I would hate if someone read this and dismissed it, as I’ve occasionally done in the past with people who wrote about how in love they were, but there’s nothing I can really do about that, I guess. I can only focus on how I feel about this, and there’s a sense of comfort in that.
Britney
I love her so much, more than anyone else that I know, and that scares me; I am afraid of the power of my own feelings, their ability to morph into something cloying, and of letting the worst parts of the Cancer in me dig its claws into this relationship. I’m afraid of scaring her off, and of her telling me that she’s stopped feeling the same way about me. I don’t want this to be even close to a rehash of the first time that we were together. I have no objective lenses to look at this relationship through, and I never know if I’m being too emotional or if sometimes we aren’t as close as we should be. 
I think about my mom a lot. Even when I’m happy, I feel a void within myself where she used to be. There’s a constant dull ache in the space over my heart. I hate it. I keep thinking about what I could have done, what I should have done; I constantly wonder what it would be like if I could go back in time and turn everything around, even though I know how unhealthy that is. My motivation is dwindling, the quality of my writing is deteriorating, and I don’t know how I can be as successful as she wanted me to be when I can barely function. 
I spend a lot of time fluctuating between feeling like a zero and not being able to believe how good most things are. I feel like a shell of my former self a lot, which isn’t saying much considering how damaged I feel on a regular basis. I wish I knew what to do. I wish the only option available wasn’t succumbing to all of this—”riding it out,” the way my guidance counselors keep telling me to. Who knew it was possible to feel anchored and lost at the same time? ♦
Britney
1. I look in the mirror every day and feel my hatred swell more and more for what looks back. Every time this happens, I feel a pang of guilt: The way I see myself was something that constantly brought my mother grief, and I don’t want to betray her, but I can’t help it. The reasons for this lie on a spectrum: Some days, I just flat-out hate how I look, and avoid seeing myself at all costs. Other times, I am not enough of something. I curve in odd places; my breasts are too small; my nose is too big. Or, my hair is too long and my face is too feminine for anyone to think of me as anything but a girl, my clothes are too telling, or not loose enough. I don’t understand these polar opposites, or the inability to ever feel content as myself. Nothing makes much sense. As I grow, my dislike for myself becomes more complicated. 
2. I wish I could be more reckless, even for a day. That’s always been an issue of mine—the avid attention paid to routine and staying in my comfort zone. It is even harder now that there is nothing stable to fall back on. Freshman year wasn’t the best, but I am constantly envious of all of the privileges I had then: a mother to come home to, the ability to do certain things with an air of carelessness that I barely possess now. 
3. I understand nothing. I constantly am confused by what my life is, and what 2014 was, and why anything is happening, especially this. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. My guidance counselor calls my repetition of certain phrases and lines therapeutic. It feels like a release, but not a balm of any sort. 
4. I find it funny that all of this is happening, and yet I am simultaneously falling more and more in love with the girl I’ve mentioned countless times before. She is one of the very few solid reasons that I am happy to be alive, and I mention her every week, but that is because I can never fully stress how amazing she is and how strongly I feel about her in one entry. Even writing about her now makes me smile despite myself. Besides my mom, she is probably the only person that I have loved unconditionally. It’s so strange to think about, but in the best way possible. She reminds me of something that my mother wrote about me, when I was younger: “I love her more than anything else.” ♦
Britney
Today is the last day of 2014 and I am afraid that nothing in my life will change for the better—that my bad habits and the parts of myself that I cannot stand will persist. I haven’t made any resolutions. I don’t see the point anymore. I am not excited for the new year at all, but I need a fresh start, a clean slate. The heaviness of 2014 is too much to continue to bear. ♦
Britney
Everything is weird. I say this in, what, every diary entry? But it’s true. There are so many things happening: I have a fever, I have a concert to go to tomorrow (it’s nice to have things to look forward to), I might have feelings for my ex-girlfriend and I think she feels the same way about me, but I am strangely afraid of commitment (and/or affection, I can’t tell). How I feel fluctuates way too much, hence the emotional turmoil in my life, especially recently. I am also the type of person who can’t let things go—these thoughts are in constant rotation in my mind, a cycle I don’t know how to end. I can only try to distract myself from it. ♦
Britney
I see my mom every few days when I go to visit her at the hospital, but I don’t really remember what it is like to have a mother. She looks nothing like she used to, sounds nothing like she used to. It is hard to believe that this is the same woman who once spent almost all of her time worrying about me. I look in her eyes and see nothing but utter confusion, an unfamiliarity which scares me. I don’t know what to do, but even more than usual, to a “real-world” degree that extends to foreign subjects like the fate of a human life other than my own, and bills, and being absolutely alone emotionally, perhaps more than I was before. I hate this more than anything. I can’t handle it. ♦
Britney
A lot of things have happened that I don’t want to write about here. It would either seem strangely insincere or take too long to talk about. All I feel comfortable with saying is that, surprisingly, things that make me feel good about being me and existing in general are happening, despite the overall situation (that is, my mom being in the hospital and me not being able to stay at my house). I’ve made plans with people I love but never see, and just the fact that I have that to look forward to makes me overwhelmingly happy. I talk to more and more people each day, trying to absorb as much as possible. I’m finding ways to beat the stagnation of my life, and for now, I’m just trying to focus on that.
Britney
Here are some things that I thought this week, in list form (it’s so much easier to explain recent happenings that way, and very calming):

 I am 90 percent sure that I have anemia. This is one of the last things that I need right now.
 There are so, so many scratches and cuts all over my body from my hands when I’m asleep, and I can see them all turning into scars. As I was already worried about the scars that I have, this is not helpful.
 I am afraid to sleep. Over the past few days, my already uncomfortable periods of sleep have been infested with some of the worst dreams that I’ve ever had.
 I need to focus more in school.
 I wish that I could go back to having small worries. I’m afraid that I never will.
 I miss my mom. A lot.

It’s hard to write about my life when everything feels like nothing. Somehow, the harder I try, the worse things become. This is definitely the worst I have ever felt, for so many reasons that writing them all here would be too draining for both me and anyone reading this. I hope next week brings less emptiness and something that I will feel fine sharing. But right now, I just don’t know anymore. I feel like giving up, but I don’t know what that even means. ♦
Britney
I am a hypocrite. I always tell other people to share their feelings, but I never really share my own. I’m too afraid of burdening others, so I clam up when I’m angry. I realized this a few days ago and haven’t been able to stop thinking about it.
Even here, in what is supposed to be my personal diary, where I share my inner life with you, I tend to keep things on a surface level, playing it safe, so that no one can accuse me of whining. Even telling you this much makes me uncomfortable. It’s like…there is so much I could say, but when I try to write it down, I get this heavy feeling in my stomach that warns me not to.
I am angry at myself. ♦
Britney
I don’t feel like I fully exist; I feel unformed, like a sculpture molded by clumsy hands and then abandoned for better efforts. I think I’ve felt this way for a while. I don’t fit in anywhere, but I can no longer avoid the fact that I have stopped trying to fit in, to be liked. I have allowed myself to be absorbed into my own mind. I’m never fully present, and sometimes I don’t even bother pretending that I am. The signs have become familiar to everyone who knows me: noncommittal answers, a sagging head during class, the glazed look I can feel my face forming when I start to succumb to the same old cycle of the same old thoughts.
I know this is unhealthy, but I don’t try to change it. If something makes me feel bad, I don’t say anything. I don’t say, for instance, “I really want to cry right now, and I don’t know what to do.” I don’t say, “I’m still in love with you.” I don’t talk about any of my feelings, really.
I have become so hyperaware of my own insignificance that I can easily let it drag me down. I no longer document moments of my life. This is all making me sound more miserable than I am. Things are just strange. ♦
Britney
I keep waking up late for school and missing classes, which has never happened to me before (except once during freshman year, but never all in a row like this). I can now add throwing away my potential to the list of reasons to be disappointed in myself. I forget things, don’t memorize enough information for tests, cannot answer questions. 
Strands of my hair are constantly coming out, either on their own or because I am tugging at them, which I have been doing for years. My mother tells me not to do it, even though I keep telling her I can’t stop and should probably go see someone about it. There are patches of hair on the sides of my head and the base of my skull; I can’t even wear a simple ponytail anymore without revealing them. It’s embarrassing. I hate that, with all that’s going on inside me, I can’t even find solace in looking OK on the outside. I always feel anxious about how I look. I really hate it. 
I need to see a therapist. This is nothing new. I’ve wanted to for years, since middle school, since I knew something was wrong, yet here I am. It’s yet another thing I can’t bring up. ♦
Britney
For the first time since I broke up with my girlfriend, I have feelings for someone else—a legitimate crush, the kind that excites me but also scares me a little. I haven’t told any of my friends yet (except one—casually enough, hopefully, that she’s already forgotten about it) and likely won’t, for so many reasons, even though I think about him daily.
I don’t want to like him, because liking someone romantically always seems to complicate things. Crushes are the kind of thing you want to share with your friends, but people always seem to think that if you like someone of the “opposite” sex, it invalidates any feelings you’ve ever had for anyone of your own gender. It’s ridiculous. Even the most openminded people I know would probably jump to such conclusions. They’d say my queerness “was just a phase,” an “experiment,” not a proper and sustained part of me. 
Also, the aforementioned girlfriend was my first friend at my school and is still part of my group of best friends, and I don’t really want to share my feelings for this new person with her, or with anyone who would surely mention it to you. I know how painful it would be if I found out she was interested in someone new. 
So, things are tough. But, for once, it’s not in a way that threatens my emotional wellbeing, making me self-destructive or sad. ♦
Britney
I broke up with her. It just wasn’t working out. I try to convince myself that it was for the best while I’m standing on the train, thinking about us holding each other after the freshman formal, or at 2:33 in the morning, trying not to cry as I remember being in her arms at a punk music festival by the sea.
Everyone talks about how hard it is for the person being broken up with, but no one has ever mentioned to me how it is to be on the other side. No one explains how to build a barrier against the onslaught of memories of better times. No one tells you how to be sure you made the right choice and not try to back out of it. 
I’m a little bit better now. Sleep remedied the sickness I felt right afterward, when I was full of emptiness and confusion. But it’s still hard for me to think back on the relationship. I have trouble saying the word ex-girlfriend. It feels so oddly final, like I am cutting a whole person out of my life, even though I know that’s not really true. ♦
Britney
I feel like I’m disappearing, getting smaller every day.
But I look in the mirror: I’m bigger in every way.
That lyric, from a Sonic Youth song, is a reference to Karen Carpenter’s eating disorder, but every time I listen to it, I come up with a new meaning. Right now it’s about sophomore year, which just started. Every day of it so far has been a new hell. I feel as though I’m shrinking away from the sights and minds of everyone I know, but I am only getting older. 
I can’t stop thinking about my ex-girlfriend, who I am apparently not best friends with anymore. Nothing helps. I sit in English class, trying to simultaneously listen to my new teacher and remember my ex telling me that she loves me, her voice playing over and over in my head until my own thoughts are clawing at my skin from the inside until I have to struggle not to scream. I don’t get it. I miss being close to her, and I think this is my brain’s way of punishing me. 
Life in general feels off. Everything feels gray, for so many reasons. ♦
Britney
I don’t know what I want, but I pretend that I do so I won’t get caught up in myself again, so I can’t get so wrapped up in my own problems that they smother me. I escape the trap by faking it. 
I pretend that it’s freshman year again—minus all the unimportant or unpleasant parts—and that my best friend hasn’t yet moved away, that another friend hasn’t drifted away so fast that I barely had time to register it, and that I didn’t ruin a third friendship with my feelings. I stay up later than I say I will to watch movies I’ve never seen before or listen to albums I’ve never heard. I want to pierce the stagnation and welcome in fresh air so I can’t dwell on how many friends I have, and how many of them actually want to be my friend. 
I’m sick of repeating myself. I’m sick of feeling like my life is stale. I’m sick of letting my emotions rip me apart and then covering it all up. ♦
Britney
I never know what to say when I am writing these entries, especially right now. Everything feels important to me, but when I try to get it down on paper, it seems average, like nothing anyone else would be interested in. For example: I’m going to be the editor-in-chief of my school’s music newspaper next year, which is probably the best news I’ve gotten all year—but trying to explain why it means so much to me feels kind of useless. Another one: I’m finally getting over my ex-girlfriend. But who isn’t getting over someone? There’s nothing original about it. Why would anyone care? But I still feel a need to talk about it, because, even if no one else cares, I care a lot. ♦

I probably know more people this summer than in any of my past ones, and yet I feel lonelier than ever. Sometimes I sleep until 6 PM, just because I don’t want to spend another full day pondering my own isolation. The only person I talk to with any regularity is my best friend.
I know this is all my own doing: I could reach out to other people, but I’ve gotten so used to solitude that I don’t even want to see or talk to anyone else anymore. I can’t remember the last time I took the train somewhere (except for the Nine Inch Nails concert I went to on Friday, which was the best thing that’s ever happened to me and I can only describe it as life-changing and the one place where I felt that I could let loose and be completely happy—besides that, everything feels empty). 
Despite all this, I don’t want to go back to school next month. I don’t want to see any of those people again.
I feel full of emptiness. It’s almost a physical sensation. Part of me wants to talk to a therapist, but I don’t know what I would say. I don’t like whining, including in these diaries, but there would be no point in writing them if I were pretending to be something I’m not. ♦
Britney
I am afraid of poor delivery, of my words, of myself. I dread another year as a background character, just another face passed by in the halls. I want a blunt and interesting presence.
So many people around me have preconceived notions, expectations, and judgments about who I am. It’s easy to tell yourself to ignore everyone else’s opinions, but the execution is the difficult part.
I want to assert a new identity. I want to stop being afraid. I seem to want a lot, but I never really make anything happen. ♦
Britney
As summer comes to an end, each day feels full of purpose. My life is gradually getting better: I am filling it with newness: new friends, new songs to listen to, new interests. I no longer feel stagnant.
I’ve started buying music again; listening to a tape on the way to school is one of very few things I look forward to about going back in two weeks. Otherwise, I’m not really excited. I have no problem with my classes, but I am afraid of falling back into the routine of censoring myself to make my classmates more comfortable. I’ve been trying to be more assertive this summer, and I don’t want to backslide. ♦
Britney
I am lying down, covered in a blanket of soreness. Today was our first day of cross-country practice, and I had to wake up early. I am learning to hurt myself in productive ways, and this is one of them. I am pushing myself to embrace growth and to try to be more in the world instead of just living in my imagination. 
I am also learning who fits into my life in a positive way and who drags me down, even if sometimes that realization sends me into bed, where all I can do is listen to The Fragile and cry. This kind of pain helps me get better. It is different from the kind that results from trying to destroy myself, from ripping apart my life until all that remain are unrecognizable shreds. This way, I feel more in control. I trust me not to hurt myself too bad. ♦
Britney
I have this odd, uneasy feeling that I don’t know how to get rid of. It is a cross between wanting to enjoy this summer and wanting to be back in school. Basically, I do not know what to do with my time. 
I want to find new things and rediscover things that excited me in the past. I want to listen to new music and meet new people, since almost everyone I know left New York for the summer. I don’t mind being stuck here, though. I need this time alone to selfishly feed my interests and remember what I feel like when I feel like myself, when I’m not running away from my own thoughts.
I am cringing as I type this because I know how clichéd it sounds, but that truth is something else I’m learning not to run from. Last week I mentioned this quote from Sylvia Plath: “Go out and do something. It isn’t your room that’s a prison, it’s yourself.” I think the key to enjoying this summer will be forcing myself to turn my prison into a sanctuary, something that helps me grow instead of keeping me confined. ♦

I turned 15 on Monday. I’m not entirely comfortable about this fact. 
Being 14 was the best year of my life, and it feels like turning 15 officially closes the door on that golden age. It’s already fading into memories and “Remember when…?”s. I wonder if I will always remember.
To commemorate my last day as a 14-year-old, I got a second piercing in one of my ears. Then I walked around St. Marks Place and the surrounding area, trying to memorize a map of important things that happened this year. 
There is so much I want to say about being 15 and surviving the summer and being in love and the thoughts I’ve had over the course of the past week or so, but none of it has the cohesion on paper that it does in my mind. I’ll find a way soon (I hope). ♦
Britney
Summer is, as usual:
1. A long marathon of wishing I actually had something to do, feeling terrible, finally watching more than two episodes of Twin Peaks, and buying new books (which I have not done in ages). 
2. Mediocre. 
3. Planning to do things I will either not do or will do after summer is dead and done: start a podcast, learn how to play the drums so that I can start a band, find something that I can actually do that will allow me to feel as if my summer wasn’t a waste.
4. An attempt to expand my knowledge and distract myself from my life through books and new music. Marilyn Manson and Jefferson Airplane are keeping me company.
5. Arid, both mentally and in terms of New York’s ever-torturous weather. 
6. The opposite of ideal. ♦
Britney
I am so attached to the freedom afforded me by these humid July days that I don’t even want to think about the upcoming heaviness of 10 months of school. I just want to enjoy being a teenager, and school isn’t really helpful in that regard. On the other hand, summer’s freedom is mostly theoretical for me—I’m not so good at taking advantage of it, despite my lofty plans.
I took a color personality quiz this week, out of pure curiosity, the way people have five-dollar readings with supposed psychics on the street just to see what they’ll say. My results were all too correct. An excerpt from the section entitled “Stress Sources”: “She needs constant attention and encouragement, but she is getting neither of those things, and it is bringing her down. She needs to escape the situation, but feels helpless to do anything or make a decision toward a solution.” The truth of it makes me uneasy. I often feel like people in my life owe me certain things (yes, like attention). I don’t even like talking about this—it’s uncomfortable to admit these faults in my thought process.
The other sections of the quiz made me realize that the stagnation I feel every summer is not something imposed upon me, but something I do to myself. All of this time alone has led to a lot of introspection, and the only thing left to do is actually change myself for the better. I need to get out more and talk to more people. This year, I hope I finally do it. ♦

I think about myself a lot, more than I should. I think about my inability to write, and the terror of a blank page. I think about bad things: things that I’ve done and things other people have done. These are the things I try to suppress, but they eventually rise to the surface, usually all at once. I try to make peace with myself, knowing it won’t really make anything better in the long run, but sometimes it can be a temporary balm for my aching brain.
I’m writing this on Thursday, July 24. Tomorrow I’m going to a house show. I have never been to a house show. I do not know whose house it is; I only know one person who will be there. Sometimes during the school year, when everyone’s in town, a band from my high school or another local school will paste crude posters (usually just Sharpie on composition paper) outside a venue they’re playing over the weekend. I love these shows, even when the music isn’t the best. Teenagers from all over the city show up with fake IDs that are barely accepted (the shows are all ages, but people try to get away with ordering drinks). The mosh pits are intense, and you start recognizing regulars after a while, kids you might not have ever met otherwise. I love the electricity of those nights. But a house show feels like such a suburban thing to do, which makes it more attractive to me. It sounds much cozier than a show at a big public venue.
I’m not looking forward to school starting again on September 4. I’ll be a sophomore. Writing that out makes me realize that I’ve been writing these diaries since eighth grade. Eighth grade! That’s insane. Looking back, I’m definitely more self-aware now than I was then. I’m also not quite so pessimistic. This year, I want to be even more self-assured. I will keep my close-knit group of friends, but I want to be more open to talking to new people and welcoming more people into my life. I’ve opened myself up to new music, and the fact that I can’t get enough of Sonic Youth or the Smashing Pumpkins, bands I used to brush off, shows me that I’m capable of changing my mind and learning. I’m very attracted to the idea of growth. ♦

The end of school finally seems like a real thing, thanks to a barrage of tests and acne and mosquito bites and a lot of introspection that makes me want to share all the time but also keep a lot to myself out of fear of losing myself to the world. I feel like I’m under a lot of pressure, but not because of any one specific thing—it’s not even mostly studying/test stress, it’s bigger than that, and more amorphous: a looming anxiety that I deal with by trying not to think about it. It feels like this anxiety has already worn out my summer before it’s begun.
There is so much I want to say, but I don’t know how to say it. I keep ending my diary entries on this note, but it is difficult not to. ♦

She makes me want to be less destructive. She makes me want to be a different kind of person, one whose main quality is not uncontrollable impulsivity. I want to be someone who says the right things and can carry on long conversations without trying to cover up my awkwardness with jokes. It’s really hard sometimes to remember that she likes me, especially when I am holding a microscope up to my worst features.
She is my favorite person, someone I can lie down with in a field and listen to Beck and laugh and talk about just about anything. I feel like talking about how much I like her is the opposite of what I should be doing here, for some reason, but it would be harder to write about my week without mentioning her.
It feels so odd, after years of devout pessimism, to fall for someone who completely overturns my dark worldview. It feels a little uncomfortable, that sudden change, but I wouldn’t want it any other way. Nothing is perfect, but everything is better. ♦

It feels funny to come to this diary today with too much to say, because usually I’m fumbling around for words to string together, straining to think of something that happened in a given week that people might actually be interested in reading about. But I’m writing this on Sunday night, and the past three days have been three of the most important days of my life! There are parts of what happened that I still cannot fully comprehend, and other parts I can’t share for several reasons, but let me tell you, it has all been life-changing.
I had my first kiss. It happened quickly in a subway, as do so many milestones when you are a New York City teenager. All that I could think about on the Q train back to Brooklyn was how it felt as though her lips had imprinted themselves on mine. And yet, everything that happened the next day made me temporarily forget all about the kiss. (I’m back to not being able to stop thinking about it, though: replaying it in my mind, trying to remember each small detail that I held on to in the hours immediately afterward.)
Let’s backtrack for a second. On Thursday, my best friend and I saw Mac DeMarco play in Brooklyn. I had never seen him live before. Then we unexpectedly ran into him at a festival two days later and even got to meet him (for a split second). It felt totally random and weirdly significant at the same time. He’s been in my life a lot lately.
Friday night, I went to my very first sleepover. It was Friday the 13th and there was a full moon, so my friends and I decided to play pull out the Ouija board for the first time. (So many firsts!) We talked to more than 20 spirits over the course of the night (and into the wee hours of the morning). At one point we decorated the board with a bunch of Nirvana albums, including In Utero and Nevermind, and the next spirit we contacted said they were a fetus who had died in a miscarriage. Here, from my notes, is what they said to us through the Ouija board:
hello
0-R7-BORN 0
seventh child—miscarriage—1980
mother R.Z.
7 [There was a circle around this number.]
Too much happened after that. There are some spirits who contact us that I can’t talk about. Other ones included an old college classmate of my best friend’s father who had died the day before and a seven-year-old who had died in the Holocaust (they said they “HATE MUESELINI” [sic]). It all felt very eventful, and I was glad I hadn’t done it back in 2012, when I first talked about wanting to try. I wouldn’t have been ready for it then. I am now.
I feel heavy. Thinking about going outside tomorrow feels like a threat to my wellbeing, but so does staying inside. My soul feels very reliant on being anxious and not knowing how to phrase anything and being worried and revisiting old thoughts without learning from them. All I can do is go over past things: the Ouija notes from Friday night, conversations, things I’ve written. I am afraid of not caring enough. I am afraid of being someone who doesn’t care enough, who forgets about other people’s cares and lives. I have seen too much of that kind of callousness in these past few days. 
Making this diary entry proceed in a linear fashion was a main goal of mine when I sat down to write it, but now I’m realizing that there’s almost no way to do that on paper. I’ll just accept that. ♦
Britney
My latest hobby has been picking apart my faults like a vulture with a dead body. I have forgotten how to write about myself; I pick apart each sentence as it leaves my pen. I can feel myself doing it right now. I hope this is temporary.
I am overpowered by a feeling of weakness. At the beginning of the school year, I had the desire to be more aggressive. I saw others expressing a loud and sweaty kind of anger, and I thought they commanded respect. I don’t think I am or ever have been someone who could be called aggressive, and that makes me feel even weaker.
I am not someone who is accepted instantly or easily into many groups, and I don’t know if that will ever change, either. I only feel completely at home with my girlfriend or with my best friend, and I am incredibly happy to have them in my life, but I also feel like an anomaly because I can’t say the same about my family or the people in my grade at school or just about any other group that I technically belong to.
I am happy sometimes, but there’s something blocking me from just being HAPPY, with no footnotes or parenthetical statements attached indicating that something is wrong.
A Sylvia Plath quote comes to mind: “Go out and do something. It isn’t your room that’s a prison, it’s yourself.” Am I the one keeping me from being happy? Am I my own prison? I feel like whenever I talk about my feelings, I sound whiny and/or confusing (because I am confused). It’s taken me an hour to write this, and when I look at what I’ve written it feels like it came from a strange, dark place. I would start over, but I know the same thing would come out, if not this week then next. I know that these thoughts are a waste of time, but the alternative, to just suppress them, is even worse. 
It’s summer, and that means that things should be different—better—but this pit of negative feelings is kind of weighing me down. Maybe it’ll get better soon. ♦

Anxiety is a regular feature in my life in the way that breakfast or the daily train ride to school is, except a lot more frustrating, which gives me anxiety about my anxiety. It starts with the decision not to tell a friend how mad I am and letting that anger grow inside me until I take it out on myself, or overanalyzing the way my hands move when I am talking or the sound of my voice. It rests on my brain like a stone, pressing down every time I move. 
Besides that, right now I have a nice existence. I think about what summer will feel like. I think about what it will be like to be 15 (and, for once, I can think of my birthday without becoming anxious about age and getting older), what life without school will be like. I write more. I don’t feel like a waste of space. ♦

I am surrounded by a darkness that presses on me from all sides while I slowly implode. No, implode sounds too explosive—I crumble. With each text message I type out, each elevator button I press, each word I say, every step I take, I am crumbling.
I feel myself become hollow, like a cave. My thoughts echo inside me.
I no longer have all these diagnoses; I have become them. They are all my thoughts.
I feel really bad, I type, immediately regretting it. I know he’ll only feel guilty and I’ll just have to pretend I don’t need him by my side. ♦
Britney
It’s unbelievable how quickly my life has changed; it feels as if everything has turned upside down in a matter of seconds, like the Big Bang, or even the Big Crunch that I read about when I was younger. It feels like an explosion of things I don’t want.
I don’t think school will ever end. I don’t know if bad things will take a vacation from my life anytime soon. I don’t want to elaborate, for reasons, but it is frustrating. I am not full of sorrow or angry, just not at ease. ♦

This is goodbye.
This is my last diary entry for Rookie.
I feel the sadness creeping up on me like the tide, and I know I’ll have regrets about this decision, but I’ve thought about it for weeks, and I know this is the right choice.
I often go weeks without turning in a diary entry, leaving the post short. It’s unfair to you guys, and it’s unfair to my editor, Anaheed, when I don’t turn anything in and am too swamped by my inner life to remember to let her know in advance.
I’m sick of writing about my most recent self. Frankly, I hate myself. It’s a temporary thing, I’m sure. My self-esteem will rise again, but I can’t do this anymore. My internal life has been nothing but pain for the longest time, and it’s hard not to make every week’s contribution negative, writing almost exclusively about my own pain and being a brat about my life, which is really great outside my head.
I’ve been through so much with you guys. Your comments and messages helped me cope with the loss of my mother two years ago, and I will always be grateful for that support. You congratulated me when I had good relationships, you supported me through breakups. You are the best readers/friends I could ever ask for. I’m tearing up as I write this, because I’ll miss being part of the Dear Diary club, which includes all of you lovely readers. 
I’m not disappearing. I’ll still write for Rookie. But not being a diarist is going to feel really different.
 Thank you all for the love. This was an amazing opportunity, and I love you all. I’ll catch you on the flip side. ♦

It wasn’t until I’d been on the train for half an hour that I regretted not embracing Erica when we said goodbye. But by then I was an hour from London and it would have been silly to go back just for a hug. She was coming to visit me in four days, anyway, so I thought about that and smiled.
When my friendships with my roommates started to fall apart and left me in a state of shock, Erica let me sleep in her bed. I curled up on the end like a dog, unable to sleep. I heard the dull thuds, footsteps, and muffled singing of a few of my flatmates above. I could imagine it all, but it all felt very far away. I felt like a muffled human. Wary of waking Erica, I tried not to take up too much space in her bed. Even in the midst of shaky sleep, I was trying to compress my body into as tight a ball as possible, until I was jolted awake by a sensation of unsteadiness. I caught myself just before I fell completely off Erica’s bed. Desperate to stretch out my limbs and to catch some actual sleep, I went upstairs.
Upon entering my flat, I heard sex noises I really didn’t want to hear and felt numb. I fell into bed and listened to the birds—a pure noise, a comforting sound—and tried to drown out everything else. I wrote a poem about loving myself when the thing I wanted to do the most was hate myself. Hate myself into nonexistence. But I resisted. I survived. And I knew that when it was morning, I could hand in an essay and go to a seminar and see Erica. 
On my walk to the library to print my essay, I felt the least confident I have felt for a long time. I avoided every person’s gaze, wishing not to be seen. But I knew I would get past that moment, that it would soon be over. I knew that it was a passing phase and my confidence would soon return. The kind of confidence that makes me run and sing in the street at night and be able to look people right in the eye. Most of the time, anyway. 
Then I accidentally dyed my hair a dun brown, but it was all right, because I needed to feel a different person. Erica and I hopped on the Tube and went to the Martin Creed exhibition at the Hayward Gallery, which was crazy and in-your-face and very distracting. Then we walked by the Thames, past the London Eye. Big Ben chimed and the House of Parliament lit up. There is something about walking through London that makes everything seem better. It’s impossible to feel like life isn’t worth living. 
Now I am home and I am really fine. Better than I ever thought I could be. I feel more tempered, more aware of life’s pitfalls, perhaps. But pretty much happy, ’cause the shit I’ve gone through has made me quite good at not taking any shit. ♦

I’d never lived with people until six months ago. I suppose closeness is dangerous. I thought I had bonded with certain people and that we would undoubtedly be friends for the rest of lives (maybe we still will be). I was so sure that I was on steady ground that any little conflict was bound to rattle me.
It is group ethics. The grouping of people to make them appear and feel stronger, and therefore less accountable. I have always been somewhat envious of that tight-knit-group mentality, but I am a drifter at heart, a social floater, and always will be. 
Something that Anais Nin said struck me the other day: “We travel, some of us forever, to seek other states, other lives, other souls.”
I have a constant desire for things to not remain the same. I want to integrate different aspects of different personalities into my life. Everyone has something unique to give, and different reasons to appreciate them as a friend and person. And because there are so many parts of me, and so many parts of every one of us, it makes sense that we would find those similarities in lots of different people, and not be tied down to one small clique.
It is strange these social groups aren’t chosen, or declared, but just kind of happen. I’ve observed them from afar for years, somewhat jealous of the bind that ties them together and lets hardly anyone else in.
But I don’t want to be stuck in a group, I don’t want group claustrophobia. When I spent a lot of the time with the flat after Christmas, I felt almost obliged to be with them and guilty to spend time elsewhere. That is not the right situation for me. I need breaks from people. Healthy, for me, is not to spend all my time with one small group of people. I don’t imagine that would be healthy for anyone.
I rearrange my uni room every so often. I change the colour of my hair way too often. I can’t settle. I have to keep changing and moving. That is why I love trains so much, and the trip is often my favourite part of going anywhere: the state of moving. It is an undefined state. I can’t just be. I imagine my life flowing ahead of me and the people in it will be constantly shifting, and the places I go will have to change to prevent me from going mad. Perpetual travel. Anything else is suffocating. ♦
Naomi
I am going to be 20 years old in eight days. I am so ready for it. I’m ready to not be called a teenager anymore and ride high on a wave of maturity. I don’t mean maturity in the sense of paying bills and working specific hours and eating my five daily servings of fruits and vegetables. I mean it more in the sense of perspective: knowing that when some shit happens, it will eventually pass and I will feel better one day and love myself even more and find some confidence.
Confidence means I can be approached by someone without wishing the ground would swallow me up. It means not having those self-conscious prickles all over my body. It means opening up, not closing off. It means being free. 
I knew the tide had turned for me emotionally when I got my hair cut and could finally dance naked again. It’s not that this way is good and the other way I am is bad. Wanting to be touched and not wanting to be touched are two sides of the same coin. The tides are always turning, but I’ll enjoy this way while it lasts. 
I am going to be an adult in the greatest sense of the word. The word means the only limits on me are the ones I choose for myself. ♦
Naomi
I am staring at a blank page, something that I’ve done every Sunday for two and a half years. I am more fulfilled as a person than I have ever been, but somehow that makes it harder to write. When I started writing my weekly diaries for Rookie, I was still haunted by the depression I’d had the summer before. I had just turned 16 and it hadn’t been very sweet.
I thought you were meant to know much more at the age of 16 than I did. I had felt the same way about turning 15, 14, 13, etc. Every 24th April I knew less, had less, than I thought I should. By 16, I thought I should have life pretty much figured out; the fact that I didn’t, I believed, meant I would never be successful or content. Instead I was spending all my time at home, unhappy and tired.
Rookie, this brand new baby of a creation, was the light at the end of that summer tunnel. I read Tavi’s call for submissions as an opportunity to be involved in something special for once, instead of just watching from the sidelines. When I think of that moment, I see a blank grey slate with a few flowers beginning to grow. I got to write about my slow crawl out of agoraphobia, my building back up from the dirt of my life, my numerous “firsts” after being so sheltered for so long, my falling a bit apart again, and finally my move to a new city, full of new firsts. Today, I can say I’ve never been more proud of myself.
I think I needed to leave home for a while to learn to actually look after myself. I had to remove myself from the damaging cycles that were so easy to get caught up in while sitting stagnant in the same house I’d lived in for 13 years. I couldn’t have become an adult if I had stayed home, having Mum to make my doctors’ appointments, buy my food, pick up my prescriptions.
Those prescriptions—my antidepressant, my birth-control pill—are the main reason I have to remember to make my own appointments at my new health centre in London. I always forget till the last minute and stress at the thought of ringing the centre at 8:45 in the morning to see if there have been any cancellations. But I always manage to do it. Then I walk to the pharmacy, brandishing that green slip of paper as if to say, “I am not ashamed of people knowing that I have my own type of malady; I am treating it, and I am treating it by myself.” There is no one to hold my hand.
If I do ever need someone to hold my hand, it’s usually Erica. When I arrived a few days late to student halls, she opened the door of her flat and said, “Things have been happening!” We went to her bedroom straightaway and that was that. Instant friendship. And that was really when my life began. My favourite activity is still flopping down on her bed, where it’s OK to be quiet. 
My most precious possession is my Oyster card, for the train. It is mine, it has my name on it, and it makes going anywhere in London so simple. I like to keep the things that could flare up my agoraphobia as simple as possible. I have gone back and forth between Birmingham and London more times than I can remember, but every journey is different. Though I am beginning to memorize the order of particular landmarks by the tracks—power stations, bridges, wind turbines, fields of yellow and caravan parks—my feelings are not as reliable. Every time I come back home something new has happened: People who are new become old, but old people become something new. Trust shifts, I have different things to talk about, different things to laugh about. All the way back and forth on the train, I am constantly weighing what to love and what to hate. What is right and what is wrong. But answers are not what I am looking for.
My happiness is much more invested in people now that I don’t spend all my time alone. I don’t trust falling in love, but I trust friendship way more than I ever thought I could. I still feel a shadow of my agoraphobic past from time to time, and I still remember acutely what it feels like to be paralyzed by anxiety. Sometimes I can move on from those thoughts easily; sometimes my face tenses when I remember my worst moments. But then I go outside for fresh air, or tell Erica, or get on the next train to see St. Paul’s or Tower Bridge or the National Gallery. I’ll buy flowers and put them on my windowsill, or rearrange my bedroom and feel renewed. 
Or we’ll go out, like we do, and I’ll dance with lovers and strangers and bestow kisses on those I have no romantic feeling for, but want to protect from the bottom of my heart. I want to protect them from themselves, because I know how much harm one person can do to their own skin and bones. If only I could reach out more to other people and teach them what I know. But I also know that a person can only ever help themselves.
I’ve always been a person that has worth, though for a long time I allowed myself to be convinced otherwise. But I am going to be 20 years old tomorrow, and the optimistic me will not let bad things define me anymore. I’ve had years of experience being tormented—I think that’s enough to be going on with. I am not the same person I was. I’ve grown and grown.
Life is more fun now. Life is happier without hatred—of oneself or of people and their actions. It’s good to realise that they are just living their lives too.
I don’t know whether any of this says anything, or enough of what I have to say. Whenever someone related to any of my diaries, it gave me a rush. It felt good to be reminded that what I feel is real, and that other people feel the same. That is perhaps the best thing about living in a community like this one.
Turning 20 means I won’t be writing these diaries for Rookie anymore. I remember one of things I wrote to Tavi the first time was that I had “a lot to say.” I have too much to say. I hope it has been enough. ♦

When I’m the sort of sad that rings in my ears and presses down on my shoulders until I’m buried deep in the earth, the walls start to melt, the ceiling starts to spin, the shadows start to dance, the wind starts to whisper.
My psychiatrist says I’m not crazy. She’s also the one who gives me the pills that still the shadows, fade the voices, and lift the sadness from my shoulders so I’m wading knee-deep instead of drowning, still slow but looking almost normal.
My therapist says I have a sickness and they’re not sure what it is, but certainly part of it is depression. My papers for my first hospital stay read “major depression w/o psychosis” and the most recent say “bipolar disorder w/ psychosis.” The one in between is different, too, but I don’t remember what that one says.
I leak sadness into the people around me. He holds me and says he feels like I am his responsibility. I don’t want to be a burden, but he makes it hard to leave. ♦

I heard the dull thuds, footsteps, and muffled singing of a few of my flatmates above. I could imagine it all, but it all felt very far away. I felt like a muffled human. Wary of waking Erica, I tried not to take up too much space in her bed. Even in the midst of shaky sleep, I was trying to compress my body into as tight a ball as possible, until I was jolted awake by a sensation of unsteadiness. I caught myself just before I fell completely off Erica’s bed. Desperate to stretch out my limbs and to catch some actual sleep, I went upstairs.
Upon entering my flat, I heard sex noises I really didn’t want to hear and felt numb. I fell into bed and listened to the birds—a pure noise, a comforting sound—and tried to drown out everything else. I wrote a poem about loving myself when the thing I wanted to do the most was hate myself. Hate myself into nonexistence. But I resisted. I survived. And I knew that when it was morning, I could hand in an essay and go to a seminar and see Erica. 
On my walk to the library to print my essay, I felt the least confident I have felt for a long time. I avoided every person’s gaze, wishing not to be seen. But I knew I would get past that moment, that it would soon be over. I knew that it was a passing phase and my confidence would soon return. The kind of confidence that makes me run and sing in the street at night and be able to look people right in the eye. Most of the time, anyway. 
Then I accidentally dyed my hair a dun brown, but it was all right, because I needed to feel a different person. Erica and I hopped on the Tube and went to the Martin Creed exhibition at the Hayward Gallery, which was crazy and in-your-face and very distracting. Then we walked by the Thames, past the London Eye. Big Ben chimed and the House of Parliament lit up. There is something about walking through London that makes everything seem better. It’s impossible to feel like life isn’t worth living. 
Now I am home and I am really fine. Better than I ever thought I could be. I feel more tempered, more aware of life’s pitfalls, perhaps. But pretty much happy, ’cause the shit I’ve gone through has made me quite good at not taking any shit. ♦

I’d never lived with people until six months ago. I suppose closeness is dangerous. I thought I had bonded with certain people and that we would undoubtedly be friends for the rest of lives (maybe we still will be). I was so sure that I was on steady ground that any little conflict was bound to rattle me.
It is group ethics. The grouping of people to make them appear and feel stronger, and therefore less accountable. I have always been somewhat envious of that tight-knit-group mentality, but I am a drifter at heart, a social floater, and always will be. 
Something that Anais Nin said struck me the other day: “We travel, some of us forever, to seek other states, other lives, other souls.”
I have a constant desire for things to not remain the same. I want to integrate different aspects of different personalities into my life. Everyone has something unique to give, and different reasons to appreciate them as a friend and person. And because there are so many parts of me, and so many parts of every one of us, it makes sense that we would find those similarities in lots of different people, and not be tied down to one small clique.
It is strange these social groups aren’t chosen, or declared, but just kind of happen. I’ve observed them from afar for years, somewhat jealous of the bind that ties them together and lets hardly anyone else in.
But I don’t want to be stuck in a group, I don’t want group claustrophobia. When I spent a lot of the time with the flat after Christmas, I felt almost obliged to be with them and guilty to spend time elsewhere. That is not the right situation for me. I need breaks from people. Healthy, for me, is not to spend all my time with one small group of people. I don’t imagine that would be healthy for anyone.
I rearrange my uni room every so often. I change the colour of my hair way too often. I can’t settle. I have to keep changing and moving. That is why I love trains so much, and the trip is often my favourite part of going anywhere: the state of moving. It is an undefined state. I can’t just be. I imagine my life flowing ahead of me and the people in it will be constantly shifting, and the places I go will have to change to prevent me from going mad. Perpetual travel. Anything else is suffocating. ♦

I am going to be 20 years old in eight days. I am so ready for it. I’m ready to not be called a teenager anymore and ride high on a wave of maturity. I don’t mean maturity in the sense of paying bills and working specific hours and eating my five daily servings of fruits and vegetables. I mean it more in the sense of perspective: knowing that when some shit happens, it will eventually pass and I will feel better one day and love myself even more and find some confidence.
Confidence means I can be approached by someone without wishing the ground would swallow me up. It means not having those self-conscious prickles all over my body. It means opening up, not closing off. It means being free. 
I knew the tide had turned for me emotionally when I got my hair cut and could finally dance naked again. It’s not that this way is good and the other way I am is bad. Wanting to be touched and not wanting to be touched are two sides of the same coin. The tides are always turning, but I’ll enjoy this way while it lasts. 
I am going to be an adult in the greatest sense of the word. The word means the only limits on me are the ones I choose for myself. ♦

I am staring at a blank page, something that I’ve done every Sunday for two and a half years. I am more fulfilled as a person than I have ever been, but somehow that makes it harder to write. When I started writing my weekly diaries for Rookie, I was still haunted by the depression I’d had the summer before. I had just turned 16 and it hadn’t been very sweet.
I thought you were meant to know much more at the age of 16 than I did. I had felt the same way about turning 15, 14, 13, etc. Every 24th April I knew less, had less, than I thought I should. By 16, I thought I should have life pretty much figured out; the fact that I didn’t, I believed, meant I would never be successful or content. Instead I was spending all my time at home, unhappy and tired.
Rookie, this brand new baby of a creation, was the light at the end of that summer tunnel. I read Tavi’s call for submissions as an opportunity to be involved in something special for once, instead of just watching from the sidelines. When I think of that moment, I see a blank grey slate with a few flowers beginning to grow. I got to write about my slow crawl out of agoraphobia, my building back up from the dirt of my life, my numerous “firsts” after being so sheltered for so long, my falling a bit apart again, and finally my move to a new city, full of new firsts. Today, I can say I’ve never been more proud of myself.
I think I needed to leave home for a while to learn to actually look after myself. I had to remove myself from the damaging cycles that were so easy to get caught up in while sitting stagnant in the same house I’d lived in for 13 years. I couldn’t have become an adult if I had stayed home, having Mum to make my doctors’ appointments, buy my food, pick up my prescriptions.
Those prescriptions—my antidepressant, my birth-control pill—are the main reason I have to remember to make my own appointments at my new health centre in London. I always forget till the last minute and stress at the thought of ringing the centre at 8:45 in the morning to see if there have been any cancellations. But I always manage to do it. Then I walk to the pharmacy, brandishing that green slip of paper as if to say, “I am not ashamed of people knowing that I have my own type of malady; I am treating it, and I am treating it by myself.” There is no one to hold my hand.
If I do ever need someone to hold my hand, it’s usually Erica. When I arrived a few days late to student halls, she opened the door of her flat and said, “Things have been happening!” We went to her bedroom straightaway and that was that. Instant friendship. And that was really when my life began. My favourite activity is still flopping down on her bed, where it’s OK to be quiet. 
My most precious possession is my Oyster card, for the train. It is mine, it has my name on it, and it makes going anywhere in London so simple. I like to keep the things that could flare up my agoraphobia as simple as possible. I have gone back and forth between Birmingham and London more times than I can remember, but every journey is different. Though I am beginning to memorize the order of particular landmarks by the tracks—power stations, bridges, wind turbines, fields of yellow and caravan parks—my feelings are not as reliable. Every time I come back home something new has happened: People who are new become old, but old people become something new. Trust shifts, I have different things to talk about, different things to laugh about. All the way back and forth on the train, I am constantly weighing what to love and what to hate. What is right and what is wrong. But answers are not what I am looking for.
My happiness is much more invested in people now that I don’t spend all my time alone. I don’t trust falling in love, but I trust friendship way more than I ever thought I could. I still feel a shadow of my agoraphobic past from time to time, and I still remember acutely what it feels like to be paralyzed by anxiety. Sometimes I can move on from those thoughts easily; sometimes my face tenses when I remember my worst moments. But then I go outside for fresh air, or tell Erica, or get on the next train to see St. Paul’s or Tower Bridge or the National Gallery. I’ll buy flowers and put them on my windowsill, or rearrange my bedroom and feel renewed. 
Or we’ll go out, like we do, and I’ll dance with lovers and strangers and bestow kisses on those I have no romantic feeling for, but want to protect from the bottom of my heart. I want to protect them from themselves, because I know how much harm one person can do to their own skin and bones. If only I could reach out more to other people and teach them what I know. But I also know that a person can only ever help themselves.
I’ve always been a person that has worth, though for a long time I allowed myself to be convinced otherwise. But I am going to be 20 years old tomorrow, and the optimistic me will not let bad things define me anymore. I’ve had years of experience being tormented—I think that’s enough to be going on with. I am not the same person I was. I’ve grown and grown.
Life is more fun now. Life is happier without hatred—of oneself or of people and their actions. It’s good to realise that they are just living their lives too.
I don’t know whether any of this says anything, or enough of what I have to say. Whenever someone related to any of my diaries, it gave me a rush. It felt good to be reminded that what I feel is real, and that other people feel the same. That is perhaps the best thing about living in a community like this one.
Turning 20 means I won’t be writing these diaries for Rookie anymore. I remember one of things I wrote to Tavi the first time was that I had “a lot to say.” I have too much to say. I hope it has been enough. ♦

When I’m the sort of sad that rings in my ears and presses down on my shoulders until I’m buried deep in the earth, the walls start to melt, the ceiling starts to spin, the shadows start to dance, the wind starts to whisper.
My psychiatrist says I’m not crazy. She’s also the one who gives me the pills that still the shadows, fade the voices, and lift the sadness from my shoulders so I’m wading knee-deep instead of drowning, still slow but looking almost normal.
My therapist says I have a sickness and they’re not sure what it is, but certainly part of it is depression. My papers for my first hospital stay read “major depression w/o psychosis” and the most recent say “bipolar disorder w/ psychosis.” The one in between is different, too, but I don’t remember what that one says.
I leak sadness into the people around me. He holds me and says he feels like I am his responsibility. I don’t want to be a burden, but he makes it hard to leave. ♦

I hardly journal anymore—I’ve been turning to letters instead. So on Friday I emailed my mum and dad:
Hey folks, Mama and Papa, etc. etc.,
I’ve had a weird day, one of those days where it’s easier to have minimal outside-world contact—but I’ve been OK. DON’T WORRY OK?
Anyway, I’ve been reading a lot of stuff today, and I read through Dad’s emails and found one that he sent just after I got to university. It made me emotional, because when I came to uni, I wanted to be like everyone else—I made a conscious decision to tell as few people as possible about my history/mental health, etc. And that’s why it’s hard on days like today. Even with the people I have trusted enough to tell, Erica especially, it’s really hard to vocalise it, because they’ve never experienced those dark days with me. But you two have. So I wish I had you to pat me on the back and tell me I am doing well. Because I am doing well: I am in London, and I go to lectures and galleries on my own. But in my desire to be “normal” and to treat myself no differently than I would anyone else, I rarely acknowledge the fact that I have achieved so much.
Dad’s email reminded me how strong I am. I don’t tell myself that enough. I tell myself I SHOULD be doing this, I SHOULD be doing that, that life should be a breeze.
Uni has taught me that life is hardly a breeze for anyone. This makes me feel somewhat better, but worse at the same time. I am not “special”—other people get sad and have loads of shit to deal with too. But then I think that I should be better at dealing with my shit.
The past is always sort of there. I carry it around with me, and it makes me feel distant from some people. The memories are the worst. I cried a bit this evening, and it was sort of a happy cry because I realised I am here despite how shit last summer was. It was SHIT. And I have to find ways to deal with the fact that it was shit. I have to accept that it was shit. I have to accept that there has been a lot of shit in the past. And being in the past doesn’t mean it has gone away. 
But other people only see what I am now. This is a complete catch-22, because that is how I want to be seen—it is more who I really am—but there are reasons why I feel or act the way I do sometimes. In fact, all of my past is the whole reason I am who I am NOW. I can’t separate the two. I can’t separate the two. How can I get them to be friends with each other?
I have been trying to remind myself that my anxiety is not my fault. It is an illness that I actually take medication to control, and I still can’t control lit 100 percent of the time. I live with it every single day, I am reminded of it every single day—it is part of my life. I am OK with that. But it is not the same as “just being sad.” It is not just an emotion that other people experience regularly. They might get a taste of it every now and again, but to put myself on the same playing field with everyone else does me a disservice. I need to remember that. I need to give myself a break.
There is more I wanted to write, but I am tired. My main point was actually going to be to thank you both for being there through all of that. Making a fresh start and having new friends is such a pleasure, but they don’t know me like you do. They just don’t know. And that is incredibly frustrating sometimes.
So this makes me miss you and also reminds me how much I love you and how much you have done for me.
Lots of love,
Naomi

Grasping the idea of impermanence. When Christmas was frosty and full of warm light but dark evenings I thought it would last forever. I was a child, it was magic. But nothing lasts forever, not even the greatest things. It ended when I shed tears onto his legs and he wouldn’t stop blowing his nose because of a cold. Tissue thrown over my shoulder, bodies flawed, not as pure. I was scared. Fear is one thing that seems permanent. 
Introspection doesn’t last long—a day, a few hours perhaps, rather than weeks. People are my diaries. I tell multiple people a feeling, an event, a thought, and it warps with each telling like a myth, and then it doesn’t feel real anymore when I go to write it down. No wonder people question mythology when it is passed around. I am Penelope and Helen, I am my own myth. When drunk people stumble and tell me how cool I am, my brow furrows because I am not just the myth, I am every second of the clock. I even feel time move when I sleep. 
The trains keep rattling and it feels like they always will. Every thought rattles through my head: every character here, every face, all information, every photo that I scroll through again and again to reassure myself that my own image has been broadcast. I need proof of my existence, especially when I wake up with the numbing behind my eyes, the pain in my chest, the weight of my body, when I feel like I could just disappear into the breeze that throws my hair into my face and I am embarrassed by my hair and I am embarrassed by my face. 
But I remember that every person’s action I receive, compute, and develop, is a reflection of each person’s self. They are selfish just like me, it turns out. Their own image is the one that concerns them; they scroll through other people’s photos only when a crush compels them to extend their consciousness beyond themselves. I have done nothing wrong.
I am a myth, not fully realised. I can never view myself from the outside. I cannot write the way other people will see me, how they will act. I can trust the right people and climb into bed with them at two in the morning. Two doors down from my myth cave, where all introspection takes place and my books remain unread. ♦

It is dusk, the horizon is yellow, I am underneath my favourite patch of sky. This place that I used to hate turns out to be the only place where things make sense. It is so much quieter here than at school, where it feels like there are constantly multitudes of people asking for my attention. When the sun is out and I can lie down so so quietly on the back lawn, there is nothing better. Here, I can relax.
At 5:30 on Saturday morning, the fire alarm went off. I remembered my coat and keys but not my shoes. As everybody emerged from their rooms and filed outside, I stood barefoot, hacking and shivering, on broken glass and cigarette butts. Some people had not gone to bed yet and held cans of drink. Someone had been smoking weed in their rooms, and some imbecile third-year who didn’t even live with us started going off about shit that drunk people think makes sense. I had a strong urge to slap him. I think this was the last straw. 
The sun was coming up, and I knew I wouldn’t go back to sleep. I’ve made a habit of insomnia ever since Tuesday last week, when I spent the interval between sunset and the sounds of the first morning trains in a panic. I booked a very early train home. I felt shit: I’d had three and a half hours, total, of sleep, I was sniffing constantly and unable to breathe properly, and the thought of my own bed was the only thing that made sense. It was a hard journey. On the underground escalators, I had to keep my gaze trained on the silver ridges under my feet lest I be overtaken by panic. Later, I shoved a lady out of the way with my shoulder simply because she was too busy fondling her beau’s bum to move at the pace I needed her to, and, I think, because I wanted somebody to take my anger out on.
The train was mostly empty. I huddled in the corner of my seat with my sunglasses on and closed my eyes. The only other human I could see was a frail-looking woman to my left, with dainty wrists and little glasses—someone’s grandmother. I felt safe falling asleep in her presence. She would look out for me.
It had been a shit week and I was desperate for some good sleep. I was sick of the sight of snotted tissues by my bed. I couldn’t stand that it was never completely silent in my room in London. I could no longer stand the idea of having to forgive people for doing shit things over and over again. I had to process so much shit and I didn’t have the space. People. Everywhere. Always.
But the thing is, these people also have kept me sane. Distracting me from shit, telling me what I want to hear (“He is an absolute wanker”), tiring me when I want to be nicely tired, sharing food, bedrooms, and spliffs. My whole worldview has transformed since the start of university. Groups of friends are a thing now.
I like that, but it is a lot to process. Along with every other stress—essay deadlines and insomnia-filled nights and what to eat and money lasting till the end of term and where to live next year and managing my general anxiety—I now have friendships to maintain, the stress of trying to give people as much of myself as I can. Right now I’m the one who needs as much of myself as I can give. ♦

On Friday night I felt next to no anxiety. It was nearer to heaven than I had felt in a long time, or have felt since.
I have not yet decided where to live next year, and the indecision drags me down. When we visit potential houses, I feel such fear. I’ve been spoilt here in student accommodation. Maybe it will all work out, but I know I won’t have my own toilet and shower, I won’t have my own view of the London skyline. Now I want to go back and start this year again. I’d go to more lectures, I’d get out of my bed more. 
It seems like as soon as I get some things sorted out in my mind, other things begin to ripple around me. There are people that I don’t feel perfect around, who bring me down, but I keep reminding myself that IT’S ALL IN MY HEAD. My self-hatred shouts and my body listens, but nobody else can hear. It’s all in my head, but I can’t silence it: I don’t write enough poems, I am not clever enough, I am not going to get top marks. I distance myself from people I thought I loved because I think they like someone else better. I circle around new people, but as soon as I’m used to them the circles get looser. 
On Friday night I didn’t feel like dancing, so I stayed up all night in deep conversation with Rob and Charlie, two guys who actually looked me in the eye. But when I told people, “I stayed up all night talking with Rob and Charlie,” they looked at me with pity. No one seemed to understand how great it really was. ♦

Erica had been up since early morning and was sprawled out on my bed. I read her her horoscope and thought how much this was what I had always wanted. I always wanted a friend to not have to speak with all the time, to close our eyes in each other’s beds and speak nonsense and not really do anything, but be something nevertheless. My energy in that moment contradicted hers, but even when we aren’t in the same place, we somehow manage to meet in the middle. 
The weekend was weird. I spent an anxious afternoon in bed not eating, reading up on unsolved mysteries and UFOs and the Texas Killing Fields and then the world felt broader and beyond here. I was oddly dedicated to pages and pages of meticulous description of the disappearance of a German family in Death Valley. I guess the mystery was partly solved, but the photo of a lone wine bottle in the desert or that empty rental car sunken into the sand gave me a grasp of what reasonable fear feels like, of how defenceless we are as humans, and a deeper feeling that I can’t really explain. Deeper than I usually like to dwell.
Getting over him is like having an itch I can’t scratch. The answer to everything is there in my head, swallowed by how I can’t hate him, I am not allowed to, my friends can’t take sides. And how he calls me beautiful in dingy fast food places and how he lifted me onto the counter and kissed me in the street in the dingy rain. Drunk kisses. Dingy kisses? But, oh my god, they are not dingy, they are far from—they are like clean little envelopes. But what is enclosed is different for both of us. 
That night was just me, him, and Holly. Holly, usually affectionately cautious, found us “sweet.”
The situation is stuck, he is stuck. I cannot change those things. The only thing I can change is me. But I don’t know how and I don’t know if I really want to. ♦

In the middle of my poetry seminar, my best friend from home texted me: “The amount of fun you are having at uni makes me very happy.” I was about to have a horribly out-of-the-blue panic attack, but apart from that, I was having fun. I am having fun. I don’t know how to write about fun, really—it’s so much easier to write about a boy or about loneliness, sadness or anxiety. How, oh fuck, I actually managed to get to university! I forced myself into my packed car even though I felt on the verge on throwing up and like the whole world was about to collapse and me and my boyfriend had split up the day before. And now I am here, having fun and getting used to it. I don’t have as much time to think and dwell, so my thoughts don’t have a chance to crystallise. Life isn’t as much about introspection. I have enough of that when I go home. I am having fun here. I don’t even know how that happened. ♦

Sitting in the kitchen, I said I felt like doing a handstand, but a few minutes later I’d lost that desire. I said out loud, “Five minutes ago I wanted to do a handstand, but now I don’t.” Everyone was like “cool story bro,” but actually it was? I’d never done a handstand before, but I was fully prepared to stride to the hallway and give it a try. As soon as I had the thought to do it, I truly believed I could. But that belief vanished as quickly as it had arrived, so I stayed where I was. I used to have a ballet instructor who liked to say, “Don’t worry if you can’t do it, try anyway.” Isn’t everything about intention? 
There’s a girl I used to know, my age, who recently got engaged. When you scroll through her Facebook wall, it is full of engagement-related posts: engagement-party photos, congratulations from other people, statuses relating to her fiancé. I don’t know how long it will be until they are actually married, but fuck me, to imagine myself in that position is impossible! I glance over my own wall and see a very different life in a different city. While she is marrying her long-term boyfriend, seemingly content to spend most of her time with only him in the city she was born in, I want the complete opposite. I want even more freedom than I have now. I want MORE.
I think it’s healthy to project fantasies on people—new people, not just one person. Fantasies are our stories. In my friday lecture, the professor explained how the whole of society is just a bunch of stories. And the stories in our heads are intentions. And nothing would happen if we didn’t have intentions at all. Maybe we TELL ourselves to love, to do things, because it would make a good story. 
But my intention is not to settle, not to get engaged or even think about it. I mean, of course I’ve thought about it, I’ve invented a story in my head—one among many. But my intention is for more. I need to remember that. And intention is just the start. ♦
Naomi
I am not going to be able to explain how I feel when I don’t understand it myself, but I will try. Sometimes, even when I’m doing something fun, I am doing it with gritted teeth. It’s like being constantly tired. But that’s when I am in a low ebb and, I tell myself, I am allowed to have low ebbs. Just because I have friends and I live in my favourite city and I get on pretty well with myself, doesn’t mean I can’t have a low ebb. And low ebbs involve waking up with a weight on my chest and not really knowing why. And feeling a fundamental loneliness late at night even though I have friends I would trust with my life.

I wrote that bit in the library, and when I typed “I live in my favourite city,” I was reminded that I live in my favourite city! So, fuck the essay I was working on, I split.
Just getting on the Underground calms me down. No matter what I’m doing or wearing, even when I’m returning to school from home and am weighed down with luggage, no one gives me so much as a second look. Or perhaps they do, sneakily, like I look at them. Once I wrote about how I was able to close my eyes at church and not be bothered or self-conscious about anyone looking at me or wondering what I was doing. The tube is the place I pray without thinking.
I walk from the station to student halls, through the places that used to be so new a few months ago but now I feel I could make my way around with my eyes closed. I like new things—the fact that I know this place so well now, so soon, tells me convinced that I will be a probably be a nomad when university is over, always moving to where even the people are new. 
But that’s a depressing thought, me getting bored of places and things and people. I so desperately don’t want that to happen. New things challenge me and hurt me in good ways. Old things let me fester. I keep on thinking back to this time last year, when my mental health was showing signs of deteriorating and I so desperately don’t want that to happen again. 
I remember when someone commented on one of my diaries with the quote “to tire of London is to tire of life,” and I thought of it while walking ’round, my phone dead, only my trusty Oyster card in my coat pocket. I thought about how I get to decide what is or isn’t tiring to me, and that I am allowed to tire of life sometimes.
Getting on the London tube though, and walking through Westminster, stepping through old buildings, staring at paintings and them staring back at me—that usually makes me feel better. ♦

I am flipping through all the pages of my journal like I’m looking for something, but what that is I don’t know. It feels as though something is missing that no amount of searching will find. This scares me. I am afraid that I will never be able to accurately describe in writing what life really is to me, even in this private forum, where I have no constraints or obligations.
When I was younger, I would just write down what was happening to me, and that was enough. But it isn’t anymore. Now I want to capture everything, but I always miss something—what the sound of someone’s laugh really means, how someone’s voice can give you the whole damn universe in a millisecond.
Being home for winter break makes me feel 14 again. I don’t go out even when I can, then I get that “missing out” feeling that I always used to have. But some part of my brain is deeply bored with all the same old faces. Worse is the feeling the people here stir in me of having nothing to offer. I feel like there is nothing for other people to like about me, which makes it harder to like myself. So I click and clank at my typewriter (reunited) and try to work it all out, but it’s just words—it doesn’t seem to communicate my true feelings. It is a perfunctory unloading but not an emotional one.
Maybe the emotion is not in the writing, but in the reading. I just started reading Waiting for Godot, and I was telling my dad that even though I was enjoying it, I had no idea what was going on. He said it was like a Mark Rothko painting—it isn’t what it is about, it’s how it makes you feel.
Last time I felt a heaviness, I was at school in London, and I went to Tate Modern. From a distance, I caught a glimpse of a Rothko—you can’t mistake that melting of colours for anyone else—and was drawn to the room where that painting was displayed alongside four others by him. I got semi-lost in their unspecified emotion. They aren’t trying to tell you some specific message, there are no hidden meanings, yet this somehow makes them say even more. They contain so much. But there was still a faint buzzing in the background of my brain. I don’t know if it was worry or the awareness of other human beings around me or aftershocks from the Big Bang still radiating around our psyches. Something bigger than ourselves.
I sat by the Thames and felt part of something bigger. I don’t feel that here. ♦

I have pink hair now. I did it without much thought, and I was kind of surprised by the outcome. Hair is the first and most important thing I see when I look in the mirror, which is dumb, because I am sure no one else notices much difference. But pink hair—you kind of notice that. Every time I looked in the mirror, part of my brain felt deeply confused for a second. What I saw in the mirror was not my idea of myself in my mind. It was like, SHIT WHO THE HELL IS THAT? That is a weird feeling. 
I liked it immediately, but part of me wants to appeal to that “natural beauty” trope of ideal-looking ladies. At the same time, I have moments of not caring if it doesn’t look good or “natural” or “pretty” by many people’s standards or that it might annoy some kinds of people. In fact, I actively like that about it. It feels almost political to me.
I’ve been changing my hair colour a lot in the past few years (sorry, Mum, about the stains in the bathroom). I feel like I contain a lot of identities, and I can’t figure how to be just one. The easiest way for me to express that is through my hair. 
Also my clothes. I have so many clothes because I am always yearning to express something different. I suspect other people would never notice, but I can never decide if I am one thing or another. 
This was evidenced when I came home one day and tumbled out of my extra-large sweater to slip on something clingier, remembering how I used to feel most comfortable wearing dark, close-fitting clothes. An overlarge sweater may be generally considered the comfy choice, but I felt more like me in the snugger outfit. For a while I’ve been wanting to look more like a boy, as shaggy and loose as is comfortable, but I could feel the tide was turning a bit. Maybe I felt like my pink hair gave me more license to work towards a more conventionally attractive image in my clothes—to embrace a contrast.
I like how you can use stuff like hair and clothes as you wish, to hide or show off your body. I am an active supporter of doing whatever makes you feel good about how you look, whether it conforms to or subverts current beauty or fashion trends. I flit back and forth between conformity and subversion, it seems, depending on my mood. ♦

I’m having more and more deep conversations with friends now that I am back in London, another one every day. I don’t pray very much these days, but one night I repeat “Thank you for my friends” in my head over and over, like a chant. It’s the most magic I’ve felt since I’ve been back at school. I have a lot of feelings, and they only become coherent and slightly more understandable when I put them into words. When I say them out loud, they become audible vibrations of my thoughts, and they have a repercussion in someone else hearing them and responding. I am not sure I know who I am or what I want right now, except in conversation with the people I am growing to love. ♦

Seconds after turning my light out, I thought about the pancakes me and my flatmates might make the next morning. Then I thought about the weed tea that a friend had mentioned in passing earlier. Then I thought about writing this. Then about his fingernails, because I had made a point in my head to write about his fingernails. For some reason, when we talked, our first serious sober discussion, I studied his fingernails. Very short and small, just a part of his hand, not a standalone feature. Stubby, for the strings of guitars and basses. I ran my fingertips over and around them. It was somewhere to look.
Our hands touched often during the two hours we spent holed up in my bedroom, an arcane sort of physical contact very unlike sex. I wanted to kiss him, even though I knew with all certainty that I couldn’t, and that was the worst. I wanted to kiss him, but the longer the discussion went on, the less I wanted to kiss him, and that felt even worse than the worst. The worst is knowing you can’t, but worse than the worst is realising you might not even want to. Or recognising that, as he pointed out, it would be better not to—that it would be “WRONG.” That drove me mad.
When I was young, I assumed that love was the simplest thing. I was brought up to regard Jesus’s love as the pinnacle, something to aspire to. The love of not just the Jesus you see painted in that nauseatingly soft light, but also the Jesus who knocked over tables in a temple out of pure seething anger. In amongst the feelings of love that make me float like a cloud, lord knows I’ve felt that sort of fury, too. I threw my ex’s mug out of the flat window just to see it shatter. That feeling has validity. But love felt more important. Love overrode everything. Nothing else mattered—not the complications, not the illness, not the sadness. I knew that Jesus forgave before there was even anything to forgive, so I did that too.
Some part of me still believes that the Bible is right and the world is wrong. It is a simplified idea of love that really only belongs in a child’s lullaby. Maybe that echo of belief is the only thing that soothes me into not giving up on basic human interaction. But the world is fucking complicated. No, not the world—the world pretty much runs like clockwork: rain falling, poles spinning, plants growing. It’s the people that are complicated.
Jesus cried and Jesus laughed and Jesus starved. I’ve cried to the point of puffy eyes, laughed within the same hour, and eaten absolute crap (not comparable to starving but near enough) within the last day. But Jesus didn’t have to survive a boy who remains stubbornly in close proximity for most of his waking and sleeping life. Maybe that means it’s not important.
I’m beginning to think my feelings are wrong. I am worried that if people knew about my feelings—if they knew how much I feel about one single person, that I still want more, that I am writing this much about it—they would think less of me.
I feel like my whole fucking life is founded in love, so what does anyone expect me to do? I can’t help that I grew up in a cross-section of worlds: one religious, which taught me that love is the most important thing; and then this society, which teaches me that love is where I find my worth. I am figuring out the most complicated facet of human existence; I should be allowed to cry and wallow and walk around in a daze.
I saw a small baby on the Overground the other day. It looked tiny and peaceful, , asleep without a thought, completely unaware of the cruelty of the world. I thought about how that little existence was a rare patch of uncomplicated space.
I turned off my light again and tried to think about pancakes. I tried not to hear the footsteps passing my door. I tried not to know who they belonged to. ♦

This week I went to Clapham to see my auntie for the first time since starting uni. It’s only five miles from London, but it takes an hour to get there on public transport. I’d like to go there more often. I’d like to go to her house and just lie down and not speak and just look at the knickknacks that fill every wall and every corner and let Ruby the cat sit on me and I wouldn’t have to say or do anything. I could just exist. I wish I could just happily lie there in my auntie’s presence and know that we are connected through flesh and blood, a connection that can’t be denied.
Brushing my teeth the other day, I thought about all of the conversations I’ve ever had with people, about people. Not gossiping, but really trying to figure out why people act as they do. To find some common factor in my experience with a certain person and someone else’s, and deciding that this must be a permanent part of that person’s personality. Does every person deserve to be thusly figured out? I used to think I was the only person with so many “flaws,” but now I realise that a lot of people do. How deluded I was, and how self-centred, to imagine that I bore all of the problems of the world.
We are forgiving. We find faults in one another and we forgive them—but only to a certain extent. I sobbed in the hallway on Friday night, stressed by my brother’s drunkenness, with Jay on my left and Erica on my right, and I said “fuck you” to the boy directly as he was leaving our flat, because I was giving up trying. No more trying. 
As I finished brushing my teeth I wondered about the ways in which people might discuss and find fault in me. They are totally within their right to. I thought of the ways in which I am not a great person and how I am aware and how being aware is the first step. I made a note of how I should really visit my auntie more. ♦
