I crave affection, I want to be loved. I want someone to hold my hand and tell me I’m beautiful. I want someone to run their fingers over my scars and let me know everything is going to be OK. I want to feel unconditional love from someone who isn’t my father; to say what I feel and to be met only with a smile. I want to be held as I cry and to be kissed to stop my mouth’s rambling. I want acceptance, and for my faults to be looked at with wonder. 
I know I’m romanticizing romance and that even if I got these things I’d still want more—maybe that’s just human nature. But now that I’ve been content for a while, I want to be happy. Many people say happiness isn’t something that can be given since it comes from within; I disagree. ♦

Is there a disconnect between how I exist and reality? Do we all form our own realities or does it have an objective existence? I don’t know the answers to either of these questions. I only know that I am so often floating in a world of my own that it would be foolish not to consider this at least once, though I have definitely considered it far more than that. 
A state of deathless decease-this is what I exist in. Writing this reminds me of eighth and ninth grade. When I write about or think about something that seems to be a reflection of a younger self of mine I mentally cringe. But the avoidance of self-reference is impossible in any case. 
I want to reread Norwegian Wood—my favorite book next to Breakfast of Champions—solely to put myself back into the vibes of that world, but the task itself would prove tedious. I work against myself—my thoughts are ahead of me in the most awful way. (It is worse when they are stagnant.) But I digress; I do not like where I am now. I’m doing well in school and I have things that I love and enjoy, but something feels off, something feels like it’s coming undone…I decide that it is not any one thing but an amalgamation of feelings and situations. The upcoming first anniversary of my mother’s passing. (I am extremely nauseous.) The paranoia of being the odd one out amongst groups that I am supposed to belong to. The anxiety attached to feeling like I am a bad person and am doomed to being this way forever, and the additional anxiety behind the relentless thoughts of whether or not the people around me think this about me. Sometimes I want to usurp myself and remain in a cocoon. The maternal warmth that sheltered me for almost 16 years now evades me and I am left lying out in the cold, wondering when the frost that has set in will finally finish gnawing at my bones and give me over to the other side. It is an unsettling thought that I lend myself to daily. ♦

Scene one: I bathe in the comfortable chill of a crisp Davao night. I am out late, hanging in a coffee shop alone finishing an essay I was commissioned to write. Afterwards, I walk around the area, listening to Fleetwood Mac’s “Gold Dust Woman” while contemplating if I should take a photo or Snapchat clip of this moment, because I wanna keep it forever. 
There’s something about fleeting moments, and our inkling to hold on to them.
Scene two: My alarm goes off. I blink the sleep and weariness from my eyes and reach out to the side of my bed to turn off the alarm. It’s 4:08 AM, time to go to work. I break all the breakable points in my body as I scream-yawn and stretch. I get up, wash my face, and brush my teeth. While doing so, I pray to my dreams and my ambiguous “bucket list” written during the peak of my youth, in the year of our Lord 2012.
I want to survive.
I feel this every time I wake up from a deep, comfortable slumber. I rise and look around, disoriented, then slowly return to where I left off in life.
I still don’t know what I’m doing, and I have no inkling where I’m going, but a strong sense of wanting to survive and thrive fills me. Even though things appear vague at present, I will push through.
I trust in the process through blind anxious fits. Whatever this may imply, one thing is sure: I am on my way and I will push through. ♦

It’s hard to believe that a world that thrives completely on creativity and the arts exists unless you are living in it. It’s even harder to be happily creative once you have lived in it and are then sucked away from it (until next summer, I guess). Even god doesn’t kick people out of heaven, right? Read More »

I am currently sitting in independent study next to Rachel, I have no motivation to do my actual course work; for some reason find it easier to do at home. So I thought I’d better write my diary. I had my last therapy session on Thursday, both my mum and dad came which is unusual, and my therapist, Georgia brought a little lemon cake and chocolate cake. The two of us ate and laughed and reminisced, then my parents came in and we talked about how far I had come. There are so many things that have changed, things I can do now that I couldn’t have done last year. It’s nice to know that my parents are proud of me and, to be honest, I’m proud of myself. I hugged Georgia goodbye, my mum teared up, and my dad stood there relatively awkwardly as emotions ran high.
After my final session, we went out for a celebratory dinner at this little Italian place where we go every year for my birthday. It was really nice to feel as though I’d achieved something, “graduating therapy,” Georgia said. I had a delicious and simple pizza with chopped tomatoes and mozzarella. For dessert, I had banoffee pie, my absolute favourite, and we headed home. ♦

Many of the students here look at me like I’m crazy; they’re not used to seeing a black girl who likes Benjamin Booker just as much as she loves Beyoncé. I’ve been attacked for voicing my opinion and disagreeing with some not so intersectional views. Just as Nola’s lover did in She’s Gotta Have It, this school has tried to paint me as in need of fixing or changing. I’d almost agree with them if I didn’t have such wonderful friends who love me and check me if I’m out of line. Read More »

My little sister, who has spent the years of this conflict silently suffering, finally exploded. She let out all her pain, and then fell unconscious. I was shocked by what I saw, and it took me a little while to realize that behind the constant smile on her face there had been an enormous amount of pain that needed to be released. The doctor told us that she did not have a physical problem, but, rather, she had suffered a nervous breakdown. Her breakdown was an alarm. It alerted me to the fact that my family is vulnerable, and not immune from the events surrounding us, even when those events don’t harm us physically. My mother blamed herself for being busy trying to provide for the family, and neglecting her children during their adolescence – the time when they need their mother the most. She was torn because she also couldn’t leave her job, which provides for the family. I also felt responsible for what happened to my sister. She is only three years younger than me, but she is the youngest, and I feel like I am her second mother. I remember going through a similar experience, hating everything around me and feeling that the pain was eating me on the inside. 
During the Feast of the Sacrifice holiday, I tried to take care of her and spend what time I could with her. Although I was busy with work, I did manage to spend the last day of Eid with my family. I took them all to a beautiful park, hoping that the nature would help alleviate their stress, but none of us was really happy. We all faked our smiles—our minds were occupied. We looked like we had lost hope.
What happened made me rethink my plans and reconsider my choices. I realized that I should take more responsibility and be more involved in my siblings’ lives. I should quit being selfish and stop thinking about leaving. My family needs me, and I should be here for them. My mother has too much responsibility and is under a lot of pressure—I should be by her side, helping her. Running away will not help; it will only make things worse.
The last five years have changed everything in our lives. Everything has become pale and miserable, even the Eid holiday – instead of celebrating, people were consumed with their concerns and worries, and kids were not even excited. The Eid holiday this year was not like anything we had ever seen before. Eid doesn’t bring happiness anymore; instead, it reminds people of what they have lost and the tragedy that they are living. I was so overwhelmed that I did not even remember to call my friends and wish them a happy Eid.
We all feel lost and we have no idea whether we will find ourselves or not. We are all shaking from fear and a lack of trust in ourselves and in the world. Sometimes I think that all Syrians should migrate to another planet, a planet where we can live in peace. Is there a planet like this? ♦

Breaking up is hard to do—so I’ve been told. With the next chapter of my life beginning, I had to, kinda, break up with my parents. The thing is, I’m all about my family, we’re really, really tight. So while going off to college is a refreshing new experience, parting ways with them wasn’t easy. Neither is the adjustment to college life. There are rumors that my school’s food contains laxatives and even without that, it is far from appetizing. A a supplement, some of my friends are hoping to have monthly dinner parties, which I’m totally open to. Back home, one of my favorite household traditions is fish Fridays. My Mom fries up whiting, while my Dad blasts Jodeci, and my Brother gets all competitive with strangers on his PS4, playing pickup games in 2K. Usually, his expressions of frustration with losing are broken up by laughter, as his friends flame one another for playing terribly. I’m going to miss stuff like that, but maybe I can make my own versions here?
I watched the MTV Video Music Awards in a stuffy dorm room on a baby TV as opposed to the huge, high-definition flat screen in my living room at home. And instead of incense and oil burners creating a beautiful aroma, the smell of weed wafted in through the dorm windows—that’s going to take some getting used to. Falling prey to peer pressure is real y’all, and I’m not gonna get all DRUGS ARE BAD, but making good decisions is hard. The best decision I made on Sunday was to stick through that horrible award show long enough to see Ye. 
Kanye West is my inspiration. Please hold the think pieces and don’t debate me. Something about his quest to die for the art, to be “crucified” by the press, seems noble and genuine to me. Did you know that his album Yeezus was inspired by the designer Le Corbusier? I’ve never been so inspired by a lamp that I recorded an album that’s on another sonic plane, but I hope to be, one day. I stan for Ye (Kanye’s design firm Donda is top of the places I’d love to work one day), but maybe it’s hard to understand why unless you saw his Holy Mountain-inspired show during his tour. 
Still, my relationship with the Idea of Kanye West is complicated. He makes a political body of work like Yeezus which stems from being marginalized as a Black man in the fashion industry, but then undermines all of that work by saying racism isn’t a thing. I laughed when, during his VMA acceptance speech, Kanye described himself as a millennial, maybe it’s just his way of demonstrating that he knows it’s young people who push the culture forward. He’s human and so he contradicts himself, it makes me love him all the more.
Another highlight of the VMAs was Onika Tanya Maraj letting Miley Cyrus know WHAT’S GOOD. That moment is like, literally, me. New York girls are not to be fucked with—even in their $15,000 dresses, best believe that! ♦

Life is like a chameleon that has many colors: Sometimes it looks bright and pretty, at other times it is harsh and dark to the extent that it makes you hate it. The increased intensity of missiles on my afflicted city has resulted in chilling massacres in which nearly 150 people were killed. The security situation was disrupted last week. My two cousins—the children of my only uncle—were among the victims. Before the crisis, we all lived in my uncle’s house and we had a very strong relationship with his children—we grew up together, as siblings. 
I was horrified that they were martyred by one of the missiles that fell on Douma. They were young men, one of them was 15 years old and the other was 17. I called my uncle to try to console him, but I broke down once I heard his sad voice as he mourns the loss of his two children. Their departure has an effect on my life that cannot be ignored; it is another wound to add to my already open wounds, and I am still losing people I love. 
Life has been defeating me. Amidst the cloud of sadness, grief, and pain, I had to do the rent lease procedures alone at the police station, because, as I mentioned before, my mother cannot take a vacation until she has been in her job for three months. Some of the staff were surprised that the lease was under a young woman’s name, especially as I barely look 15 years old. 
I encountered difficulties as I went back and forth between offices, so I asked one of the staff members to help me. After he found out that my father is dead, he asked me to wait until the end of the working day when there are fewer customers. He promised to help me, however I discovered later that he is a despicable person. He asked me to stay only to get close to me. I slapped him in the face, but he threatened to obstruct my apartment leasing procedure. 
I gathered up my courage and went to the police station director’s office, I told him what had happened. The man denied it, of course. The director promised to facilitate my procedures and to punish the staff member. I left the station shocked and wounded. At that moment I felt like I lived in a jungle and humans are monsters, and that it’s necessary for me to be very cautious and attentive.
I honestly hope to leave Syria, because I don’t want to change the way I look at it more than I already have. I don’t want to hate it, and I want to keep my respect for its people. What has this crisis done to us? Has it changed us? Or revealed our masks? I am incapable of finding myself here; there is nothing in Syria now except for humiliation, indignity, and death. ♦

Sometimes I feel like I don’t fit into any categories anywhere. I’m mixed race, black and white. And even as a mixed race person, I look white, so I can’t fit in with a crowd of black people or other visibly mixed race people. So let’s say I wander over to the white part of society, as soon as they find out I’m mixed race I become the token black friend or, even worse, the token “ethnic friend.”
Then, I came out as bisexual. I was always aware of homophobia and transphobia, but biphobia was never something I’d noticed. But how I’ve noticed it now! You forget that queer people can be as just as dismissive and phobic as straight cis people can be to queer people. Perhaps that’s something I can get used to, but being asked by a straight, white, cis boy if I’d be up for a threesome purely because of my sexuality, will always be annoying. 
My learning difficulties also make me feel like I don’t belong when, in education, you’re only noticed if you’re incredibly bright or have a prominent, noticeable learning difficulty. When you’re in the middle of the spectrum, like the majority of people, or have a smaller, less visible learning difficulty, like myself, life and education seem unfair and as though there isn’t a category for you. 
I could go on about the unfair categorisation that goes on with regards to mental health, but you really don’t want to get me started. ♦

I get really nervous before school starts. I can’t eat because my throat is all “hell no,” and then my tummy is all “HELL no.” It twists and turns and flops and I get clammy and everything feels too warm and suffocating. I inevitably start thinking about my third grade science teacher telling us how bad carbon dioxide is. (To this day, I am 100 percent convinced that warm air is carbon dioxide; I can’t even be under my covers too long before thinking, you better watch out for that CO2 man, it’s bad!) I also start sweating on my legs and my lower back and it’s just so gross.
But last week, I started my junior year of high school and I felt fine! My first day felt like any other day at school. Maybe it’s because my first two classes were two of my favorites—French and Computer Science. I had the same teachers I had last year, so I didn’t experience that feeling of not knowing. It makes me think, maybe it’s not knowing what will happen that usually makes me so nervous. Coming in to my first two classes knowing the teacher, my classmates, and what was expected, made it easy.
This year I’m taking Honors English Three, and my teacher is literally all over the place. He sometimes speaks in a weird language similar to pig Latin but with an “f” sound following every syllable. He almost never wears shoes and he plays music over the speakers while he’s talking or while we’re working. So far, he’s played Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, Alt J, Beyoncé, The National, and that band with a song in a Geico commercial. He rides a skateboard up and down the classroom’s center aisle and sometimes he’ll hop on a desk and start yelling—but not in a bad way, I think he’s just really expressive. We also have this classmate named Carliscious who is basically a scarecrow. Truly, he’s a shirt and pants stuffed with hay or something, his head is a kickball with a face drawn on, and he wears a hat. Carliscious is also included in roll call. As wild as my teacher seems, he’s actually really good.
This week, we have an essay to write. So far, nothing I’ve written for this class feels like me. I’ve been trying so hard to sound like I belong in the class, using big words and constructing huge sentences: I was turning in the work I thought my teacher wanted to read. Now that I know there’s a degree of freedom in what we’re doing, it takes a lot of pressure off. Our assignment is to write about A Mercy by Toni Morrison—probably the most difficult book I have ever read. It jumps back and forth in time; perspectives switch without warning; it’s set in the late 1600s (BARF); and it’s about slavery, religion, and mercy. The latter concept is apparently SO important that our prompt for this essay reads, “Should this book be called ‘Mercy’ or ‘A Mercy’?” Like, are you kidding me? That’s so vague! We’ve been provided some background information about why Morrison picked that title, but I guess I’m meant to question whether there’s one big mercy that shapes the entire book or if there are multiple mercies throughout it? Anyway, I’ve been trying so hard to keep up with that class that I skipped the first three days of my honors chemistry class and sat in the bathroom doing English homework instead. (OK, not entirely because I was working so much on my homework, but the chemistry class is at upper campus and it was hot this week!)
Besides all the chaos of my English class, being back at school means getting together with my friends and eating lunch together. In French class, I saw my friend Jasmine, who really makes that class. We are two peas in a pod (actually, pisces—we are pisces in a pod), we just vibe so well together. In all, I’m starting to feel more comfortable with school, and I am having a really good go with life right now. My friends and my work are all coming together. Life feels really solid right now. ♦

I’ve been a college dropout for a semester’s worth of time now, and for the past month, I’ve been working part-time at a market research firm. In between shifts and durimg days off, I take solitary walks around the city, listening to new music, listening to my mind. While this may sound good, it only feels half of how it’s supposed to feel. 
I live in a city where, when you look around, friendships and relationships and all other kinds of “ships” are present. That’s a good thing, but it somehow makes me feel sad and alone. There are nights when all I really need is a person to talk to, laugh with, and touch, but I have no one. There are times when the one I call home is not enough to keep me warm. There are times when my own hand cannot wipe my very own tears. There are times when my words of self-encouragement are not enough for me. There are nights when I experience my inner self cry from loneliness. 
Part of me wants to chastise myself for feeling inadequate and discontent, but is it a sin to feel these things? For two weeks, I have been scribbling the same words in my journal over again: IT IS NOT A SIN TO NEED A HOME IN A COLD, LONELY CITY. As introverted as I am, there are times when I need people—their presence, energy, vibe, aura—to lift me up on days when I feel like floating garbage. It’s sad, though, that when I send out needy, “rescue me” text messages, I get nothing. And when I need to be alone to recharge, people come hustling at my doorstep.
Everything feels and looks unbalanced, unnatural, inorganic. Why are things in my life discordant? Every night, I ask the universe these questions. Every night, still, I get no answer. Or maybe I already have the answer, which I am too stubborn to notice and accept.
While I may suffer too much from demanding more from the universe, I hold on to the hope that all will be OK soon. After all, I can always go back to forgiveness. I know I can always forgive myself. ♦

“We’ll try to get you in for an MRI in the next two weeks,” the doctor says. Until then, she tells me, I should seriously consider going back in an air cast until we get more conclusive results. “It can’t hurt, and it might help.”
And just like that, I’m done.
Last spring I played six games before my ankle took me out of commission. This fall I only made it through one.
And all it took was one sharp deceleration on an uneven patch of turf, one jolt of pain, fleeting, a few minutes of limping around after before finally bowing out for the day. One doctor’s appointment. One scheduled reexamination. One leg in a boot until further notice, and the next day a school full of people exclaiming and demanding to know what happened, what went wrong “this time?!”
My explanation gets shorter and shorter each time I’m asked. “I was in the boot last spring, remember, and didn’t wait long enough before coming back to practice. So it never really got better. It’s been bothering me all season so far, I guess, and when we finally got in to see the doctor she recommended that I go back in the air cast until my MRI. That should be next week, we think.”
Then, “We think it didn’t fully heal in the spring so I’m getting it reassessed. We’re trying to get an MRI scheduled, though, so I can find out what really happened. It might have been a high ankle sprain, those take longer to heal.”
Then, “Yeah, I tweaked it again at practice last week.”
I’m tired of talking about it and dealing with it and having to make excuses for why I can’t play, can’t run, can’t even climb a flight of stairs. I’m tired of not being able to play the sport that I love without that jarring pain that’s almost familiar now. I just want it all to be over. I just want the spring season to come and my fitness along with it. ♦

Life is becoming more and more complicated. It has overwhelmed and confused us. I have become impatient, violent, impulsive, and hateful of life and people.
I have one goal right now: to leave Syria as soon as possible. There are many reasons why I have adopted this goal, but the most important of them is that I cannot realize any of my dreams here. For a long time, I convinced myself that Syria was my country and I should stay, but, unfortunately, it is not a country anymore. It is a group of gangs that ravage people without mercy. What can I say? I am fed up. Our bad financial situation aggravates my mother and her attitude toward us. Our life has shifted dramatically and I believe that my family is on the brink of destruction and loss. My teenage brother is giving us a hard time. My little sister expresses her rejection of our bitter reality by being stubborn and reckless, and our other sister just got married to escape from the whole situation.
After taking many computer courses, my mother finally found a job, but, unfortunately, it did not last–the working hours were too long and the pay was not even enough to cover our rent. She has been trying really hard to improve our situation, but her efforts have been in vain. 
I have to find a way to help my mother. I have not been able to help from here, but if I travel, I might find a good job. The biggest issue that my family faces is money. I never imagined that money could be this important. I feel ashamed that money controls people’s lives, decisions and dreams, but this is the reality that I cannot ignore any longer. Lack of money overwhelmed my mother, forced my sister to get married and travel, and forced me to quit my studies to work. 
I will travel. It does not matter whether it happens legally or illegally. I know that my family needs me with them, but I also know that I can help them better if I find the right opportunity abroad. 
I hate this war and I hate the death that surrounds us and takes away our beloveds, one after the other. I hate the death that recently took my dear friend, when her neighborhood was shelled.
I was stronger at the beginning, but the war has drained me dry. It looks like I cannot continue. I have lost the energy to keep trying again. I believe that it is time for me to leave. ♦

This week at my dad’s has been rough. On the first full day after the switch, we got into an argument (my parents are divorced so I switch houses every week). I can’t even call it an argument, because according to him I’m not allowed to get angry at him, or raise my voice at him, because it’s disrespectful. It turns into me trying to speak, but being cut off by constant tone policing and him yelling over me. 
The issue was that he wanted me to make an appointment for him and I said I would, but I didn’t do it immediately because he didn’t tell me how important it was. In response, he accused me of trying to deliberately sabotage him. That’s so frustrating in itself, but I had also just come back from being with friends, it was only the beginning of the week, and I didn’t want any problems. I tried explaining myself calmly and respectfully, but he turned his nose up at everything. I started crying. Recently, it feels like every week at my dad’s comes with a blow up like this one. I don’t know why it’s happening but it sucks. 
When the argument, which had a lot to do with privacy and power dynamics, finally subsided, I told him that to solve this issue of miscommunication, I’m not going to talk to him as much. Now, close to a week later, I haven’t really spoken to him. In the car, I sit in the back seat rather than the front. I give one-word answers to his questions about my day, when usually, I go on a spiel and throw in odd details, too. When I come home, I go straight upstairs to my room, making it a point to NOT watch Family Feud, which is part of our fun, post-work routine. We haven’t been eating dinner together recently, so when he texts me to say food is ready, I don’t come down until much later. Before, the family would sit down and pick a show to watch and talk about together. It makes me upset that he thinks I’m the one in the wrong, but he’s nowhere close to considering that maybe he messed up. He doesn’t often take accountability for his actions.
That fight hasn’t really impacted the other parts of my life. I’m still able to focus on work and talk to my friends, both of which are really important to me. But being submerged in this negative environment makes so upset that I worry about things not being normal, or not being able to control how sad I am about it. A while ago, I was wondering why a lot of my friends have never seen me cry, especially since I cry a lot (I put this down to being a Pisces). I think I’ve just got such great friends that they can totally turn my mood around. I feel bad talking about family problems anyway; I don’t want to talk about myself too much, or send bad vibes their way. They are dealing with their own things, too.
On a brighter note, I am taking a cool concurrent enrollment course, which means a professor from one of the local colleges comes to our school and we get college credits for this class. It’s like an AP course, but without the stress of an AP exam. (My last AP exam was stressful, but I also rushed through and took a nap the majority of the second half and I still scored a three! Also, the proctor was also hella cute, anyways!!!!). This course is African American history which I know I’m gonna have fun in. Plus, I get to switch to my mom’s house this week, so I won’t have to be here around my dad. ♦

I love the internet. I’ve learned so many things from it, and throughout the years it’s helped me make so many friends. Through it, I get to talk to you all every week, and learn about events and movements. We were always told by parents never talk to strangers, but online, I think we all forgot that piece of advice. My first internet friend was Charlotte, a funny little blonde girl from the Netherlands. We met on a website that connected potential pen pals and we became fast friends. At first, we would talk every day after school—I was 12 or 13 at the time—and Charlotte was a great help and a comfort to me. She always made me laugh and she had intriguing tales to tell in every email. I always felt bad as she spoke English incredibly while I knew no Dutch. Even though we don’t speak anymore, I would like to thank Charlotte for introducing me into the world of the internet. 
Although I should probably add: Don’t give out your information to strangers, online or otherwise. ♦

I keep going—opening up new doors, closing old ones, healing wounds, creating new ones, nursing fires, igniting new ones, and so on.
I started writing poetry again for the first time in two weeks. There are moments in my life that seem to call out from my heart and brain; they beg to be released into words and flow and rhyme, that is, poetry.
I started smoking again.
I started looking everyone intensely and sincerely in the eye, even the men at my workplace. This meant becoming acquainted with a boy whose eyes led my lungs to stifle for a night. He told me yesterday, “There’s something about your hair I can’t quite place,” and that “it’s beautiful” and he “likes it.” I smiled and thought of the boy who broke my heart a year ago, and of how he also used to comment on my hair or my shoes.
I know that I know better.
I am reeling, thinking of all the possibilities that would come my way if I open myself up to the world, but there’s a protective, motherly side to me that wants to protect myself from all the harm this may cause. 
I know that I need this. I need to feel pain every once in a while to remind myself I am alive and incredibly human—bones, flesh, sweat, tears, blood. I know that I need to feel the crushing weight of being alone, and lonely, in order to remind myself of my capacity to attend to my own needs. I need bruises in my body, scratches on my neck, breaks in my nails, to remind myself of my limitations, and at the same time commend my spirit for remaining steadfast amid the destruction.
Destruction is rebirth. As I think of my greatness, I feel my hands tremble. ♦

It’s been a tough week. 
I’m not adjusting to college as quickly as I’d imagined. I had this very specific idea about what college would be for me. A world where I could access: Infinite resources that would allow me new ways to communicate my ideas; people to collaborate with who have similar interests; a newfound sense of self. Now, to be fair, we’re only in week three, but I feel no closer to the fulfillment I’ve been actively seeking since high school. I am unsure if this just is my inner self never being satisfied, or if I should actually listen closely to this unhappiness. 
I brought up the idea of taking a break from college, or maybe attending a less isolated school, with my mom, who just won’t have it. I feel like I’m flying solo on this one. I’m going to have to, “put on my big girl panties” and learn to roll with the punches a bit. Everything isn’t going to go my way, and apparently, I have to ditch my naïveté and realize that the real world isn’t going to afford me the opportunities I want if I’m not a college graduate. I am once again, stuck in a position and unclear of what the outcome should be. 
I owe it to my parents to get a degree, and I’m going to do that. I just feel as if I am never in a position where I am satisfied with myself. Explaining this feeling any further will only cause me to down crying. 
On a positive note, I now have my own college radio show. ♦

I don’t think I’ll ever stop regretting you. I only said yes to becoming your girlfriend because I thought my feelings for you would grow. I kind of thought you could make me feel human. But my feelings didn’t grow, they stayed the same, meaning I still just thought you were a nice boy and that’s all there was to you. Your lips felt like gelid wet sausages trying to absorb my energy and personality for your own gain. It turned me off. I let you a quarter of a millimeter in because I thought it would make me like you if you reacted the right way. You didn’t. 
Instead, you thought my many issues—issues you admitted you could never understand—made me “interesting,” and you liked the fact that I was “dark.” You even said that you were initially enthralled by the idea of me; it made you feel like you were dating a character in a John Green novel or something. 
I am not an idea or cool jaded YA book character. I am Thahabu. My feelings about death, the spirits, my pain, loss, and deformity are not part of some movie script. They are not “interesting” or “deep.” They are my fucking pain and that is not to be admired.
You always told me how strong you thought I was. I never said thank you because I already knew that. Everyone tells me that. My body and mind have endured so much, I know I’m very resilient, but I’m fed up with being told I’m strong. Being strong is tiring. What I wanted you to say was it’s gonna be OK, and it’s OK if I’m sad about the shit I’ve survived, it’s OK to be a girl who thinks about her dead mom every day, but forgets Mother’s Day every year. 
I wanted to be weak, but I was just a character to you, and you were just my immature mistake. I regret you and the time I wasted on you. We ended on good terms and you still wanted to be friends. I said we could be. I lied. I am a harsh woman with a big warm heart and looks that could make a dead man smile; and you are just a child too busy running away from your problems, and living off your mom’s sweat and money. ♦

I feel very stupid.
I was so sad last night. I think this is going to be a weekly thing: falling down and getting back up. I don’t know how long until I fall down and stay down. 
I was sad because I hate being in this place where my vision becomes blurry. I don’t like acknowledging it, because I won’t be able to leave for another two years. When I can’t take it anymore, my mom asks me, “When did this start?” 
I have always seen blurry here; it’s just that I recently realized, in leaving, that it is possible for me to see clearly.
I came to the late-night conclusion that if I was thinner, my problems would be less overwhelming. It’s twisted how I can feel so deeply like giving up during one of my existential crises, and then decide to pick on myself over something as superficial as my body.
The following morning, I stood at the kitchen table for two minutes wondering what to do, the effects of last night lingering like ashes after a fire. To eat, or to eat barely anything? I stood there wondering what was right. When I was sick some years ago, it was so obvious. But now, which choice will make me happy? Which one is the angel or the devil on my shoulder? So hard to see.
On the car ride to school, my stomach hurt so bad but I felt even more stupid. A stupid that I have never ever never felt before, even in my life of failed tests and mistakes and falls and jokes that were never laughed at. I knew I felt worse than if I had been a normal person and had eaten a normal, healthy breakfast.
The stomach pains went away during first period, but the cloud of personal shame didn’t budge. ♦

We’re living in a society where I’m judging you and you’re judging me—for my hair, my skin, the way I dress, as if the clothes I wear make me any less. Do any of these things change who I am, or what I am? Yes these factors are a part of me, but to judge me on something so trivial, so inconsequential, is like judging food on the way it looks, judging covers without reading the books. 
You’re only going skin deep, ignoring the person underneath. So what if I’m black and white, don’t give me attitude because of my weight or height. What I choose to present isn’t all of me, it’s a fraction of a person I intend to be. I’m not calling you out on your judgment, all I’m questioning are your actions. We are all guilty of many things this being one of them. Seeing people you don’t know and thinking of them sluts, seeing a teen with scarred arms and assuming she cuts. That kid on the bus deep in a book, you don’t say it aloud but you’re thinking nerd, the girl that cries on her own just wants to be heard, but you roll your eyes and walk away, she’s a wuss, doesn’t need help, you can’t deal with this today. If you stop for a moment and rethink your judgment you might learn something valuable, make a friend, fall in love. All you need to do is shove away your preconceptions, your prejudice and the notion that you know someone who you know nothing about. 
There are things about all of us that need to be discovered. We don’t carry boards around of who we’ve lost, or keep the pricing of clothes so you know what they’ve cost. We don’t yell from speakers that we’ve been through hell; we just hope one day you’ll be able to tell. On my forehead is not written my existence, my life story, my skills, my persistence. All you can know are the exterior things, the rest is to be discovered. ♦

I am practicing living in the moment.
It’s so ridiculously beautiful how, whenever I’m present, I notice the faint glow the light creates on my grandmother’s dyed hair (the color has faded to plum now and I like it so much); I hear positive voices in my head, howling reinforcements to get me through the day; I become more aware of people’s kindness—how they actually don’t mind going out of their own way just to help someone, even a stranger; I see detective-ish coded glances, winks, smirks, and hand signals; a friend’s commonplace glance now seems to me a declaration of trust.
I marvel at all these. I find these profound, meaningful, lovely little things by mindfully staying in the present moment and stitch them together until I come up with a smorgasbord of human warmth and goodness. Also: Ugh yes, it gets me through some bad days.
Speaking of the present moment: Tonight, I am getting ready to see friends who I haven’t seen in a month and I am hella excited to catch up with them. I’m listening to the The Queen Is Dead, an album by the Smiths, and I find myself dancing.
I can feel the night’s impending magic reverberate in my nerves. ♦

There’s been a three-item list sitting on my nightstand for almost a week. It reads:
1. Ankle arthroscopy
2. Anterior talofibular ligament repair
3. Peroneus brevis tendon tear repair
It is written in the scribbly handwriting of the podiatrist that interpreted my MRI results and looks like a bunch of medical nonsense, but I know all too well what it is. It’s the list of procedures that a surgeon will need to perform on my ankle when I go under the knife this fall.
The podiatrist explained each of the injuries that had shown up on the MRI with a brisk tone and careful fingers prodding at my foot. She reassures us that the surgery is one of the safest and most reliable that they perform—the good news. Then the not-so-good news: It may be up to a month before they can get me on their schedule, and it’s a 10-week recovery plus extra physical therapy. Which puts my return to running, let alone playing soccer, at the beginning of February—at best. Last year my high school team started training on the first of March.
When she left my mom said, “You can cry, you know, it’s okay.”
“I don’t want to,” I said, and walked out of the clinic with a phantom limp and went home and did not cry.
The next day my counsellor asked me if I was scared of the idea of surgery. “No, I’m not scared,” I said, “but I’m angry.” I’m angry that I spent months on the waiting list to even see a podiatrist because that meant that my injury was just getting steadily worse. I’m angry that I wasn’t more careful with it, especially when I started training again 
this fall. I’m angry that the simple “sprained ankle” that brought my junior year season to a very abrupt end is now putting my senior year season in jeopardy almost a year later.
I’m trying to find the silver linings. Without soccer on my schedule this fall, I have more time to work on academics 
and college applications. It’ll be humbling. A learning experience. I’ve never been on crutches before. Maybe it’ll be good for me—recovery, physical therapy, starting from scratch in terms of my fitness. I can do things “right” this time.
But at the same time, I just miss running. I miss the game. And right now February seems very, very far away. ♦

Last week felt really long even though we had Monday off. Every night was a late night and getting up in the morning was such a drag. The night I had to finish my super stressful English essay holds the record for the least amount of sleep—I had a little under four hours. Plus, it was super hot. Beyond hot. 
My most recent late night was on Friday, when I was up until 4 AM watching BuzzFeed videos. Saturday was my half birthday: I’m officially 16 and half now! I celebrated by hanging out with my friends Suze, Tamia, Juliette, and Tasha in the city. Unfortunately, it was really cold—the one day it was cold this week—and we were at the beach. We helped Suze get some shots for her film project, then went to Wholefoods for snacks. We ate in the park, hung out, and decided to rush to Warby Parker to try on glasses. 
The following day, I went to Oakland Pride to watch my sister perform. It’s really different from San Francisco Pride, which is spread out and crowded with a lot of white women wearing rainbow tutus. Oakland Pride is cool and smaller and just so obviously OAKLAND Pride. Dio didn’t come so it was just Sienna and Christina, which was cool because I haven’t been to Pride with either of them before. 
In English class we finished the Toni Morrison book I mentioned last week, and started a novel called The Road by Cormac McCarthy. It’s really creepy. It kept me up one night because I was scared of the setting (post apocalyptic Midwest) and the premise (a road that a man and his son walk along while avoiding cannibals). 
I’m not looking forward to being at my dads this coming week because it’s still kinda rough between us, and I’m not talking to him. I hope things turn around soon. ♦

I started college recently and it’s so amazing. I’ve made friends of all kinds, mainly with the awesome Rachel and James who I’ve hung out with every day. I sat next to Rachel on the first day, she was really friendly toward me and didn’t seem to know anyone, unlike others in the class. The following day I sat with her again, and discovered she was friends with James. I thought he would be a bit intimidating but it turns out he’s actually really sweet. The three of us have been texting daily ever since. 
I’m studying level three Media, which means I get to do all the creative stuff that I’m good at, without failing with an exam at the end. I’m also getting a small qualification in Enterprise which I’m excited about. I’m still not entirely sure what Enterprise is, but so far it seems to be a more fun and creative version of a business course with a smaller qualification. I know we’ll be learning how to create our own businesses, and the work that surrounds that. We had our first lesson today and it was brilliant. I was terrified about the first few days, but now that I’ve settled in and spoken to almost everyone in my class I am genuinely excited. The whole class and staff seem really nice and I hope everyone stays that way.
The only down side to my new college is that instead of it being a 10-minute walk from home, like my school was, it’s a 15-minute walk, 25-minute bus journey, and then another 10-minute walk. Its not as bad as Rachel’s journey: She has to get a lift, a bus, and two trains. 
On a separate note, I’m looking for a second online job. While it would probably be best to get a non-online one, I don’t think I could cope with it. I have improved so much over the year in terms of my anxiety, but it’s still something that I fight with every day and getting a so-called real job would be just be too overwhelming. ♦

In my dreams, I am lost…lost in a labyrinth sprung out of my own mind. Sometimes I think about the kids from my second inpatient stay who were too far gone to be able to ever get any kind of help. Most of them were ruined by bad trips. I fear a similar fate. 
Too often I fall prey to the notion that every single person and thing that I encounter in my life has some kind of connection to me, is a representation of a possible outcome for me. I think it’s me worrying too much. I can’t tell what’s worse, the awful nihilistic attitude I had before or this. Maybe it’s good that I’m worried about myself. 
I hate waking up early every morning but I find things that make days even more worth it: Dark Side of the Moon is my new favorite album, Twin Peaks is my new favorite show, and Babes in Toyland is my new favorite band. I am surrounded by newness and I feel so lucky! But why do we, as humans, feel the need to ridicule anyone who expresses obvious enjoyment or excitement or gratefulness the way I am doing? I find myself monitoring my own words for any sign that I’ve come off as naive or childish and find none. Happiness should really be seen as a beautiful thing, not a pitfall that makes us any less interesting or able to maturely process things. 
This is supposed to be a recollection of my own thoughts and my own week but I can’t help but add this: Find moments to appreciate living. Find at least one thing that makes you happy and hold onto it like there’s no tomorrow. Unlearn cruelty. Savor your own existence when you can. ♦

Saturday, 8 PM: My excuses are polite and my elbows are sharp and that’s what gets me to the very front of the crowd, just underneath the stage, mixed in with everyone who’s been camped out for hours. “Lilly, there’s room over here,” one of my friends yells as I approach them, and I squeeze into their space feeling a little guilty about my height. It’s all worth it, though, when I offer the much shorter girl behind me my place in the second row, and her eyes go wide and she says “Really?!” and then, “Thank you!” I can see over her head, anyway, but I feel the warmth of the crowd beneath my ribcage now. I belong.
And I’m just in time, because only minutes after I find my place, the lights go blazing and the crowd goes wild.
“We are stranger than Earth,” sings Megan James of Purity Ring, “With her seasons misled / Stronger than her moods…”
She wears mirrored gloves that reflect the light show at all angles, turning her image on my camera to a fuzzy outline in neon colors. When her hands are wrapped around the microphone she is just a silhouette backlit by a spectral glow.
“Again, again, again, I wasn’t thinking about you,” the crowd chants for her, and she is so close that I feel like I could reach out and touch her.
“Look, everyone!” she calls out during an instrumental, pointing over our shoulders. “Look at the moon!” 
The moon is very close to full—the long-awaited “supermoon” is the following day—and even behind a screen of cloud it’s bright enough to cast a pale glow on her face as the song ends and darkness falls across the stage. We do not turn to look at the moon. We have eyes only for her.
“You be the moon / I’ll be the Earth / And when we burst / Start over oh, darling / Begin again, begin again.” ♦

Nothing eventful has happened this week: If anything, it’s been kind of trash. I got sick, broke my MacBook, and found out that The Bletchley Circle won’t be renewed for a third season. I loved The Bletchley Circle. I’m secretly a grandmother who enjoys watching BBC period dramas and documentaries. I recently watched a good one on the history of funk music in the ’70s. I have an affinity for black American culture of any time period, so it was a great watch. Also, Larry Graham of Sly & the Family Stone and Graham Central Station is the uncle of THE Aubrey Graham. That’s cool as hell. I’m fed up more than ever with college and in search of a hustle to make enough money so I can drop out. I might have to start selling Fit Tea on the gram like Amber Rose and them. Pray for your girl. ♦

For Jordan
You are gardens.
I say gardens plural not singular,
Because you’re too vibrant and resilient to just be one.
You’re made up of the most ethereal pastel roses,
And the brightest sunflowers,
Ain’t no way you just one.
Your soil keeps you grounded,
But you rise even from the toughest concrete,
And stick it through the worst droughts.
You are colorful gardens,
Among a dying field crop. ♦

Breaking up is hard to do—so I’ve been told. With the next chapter of my life beginning, I had to, kinda, break up with my parents. The thing is, I’m all about my family, we’re really, really tight. So while going off to college is a refreshing new experience, parting ways with them wasn’t easy. Neither is the adjustment to college life. There are rumors that my school’s food contains laxatives and even without that, it is far from appetizing. A a supplement, some of my friends are hoping to have monthly dinner parties, which I’m totally open to. Back home, one of my favorite household traditions is fish Fridays. My Mom fries up whiting, while my Dad blasts Jodeci, and my Brother gets all competitive with strangers on his PS4, playing pickup games in 2K. Usually, his expressions of frustration with losing are broken up by laughter, as his friends flame one another for playing terribly. I’m going to miss stuff like that, but maybe I can make my own versions here?
I watched the MTV Video Music Awards in a stuffy dorm room on a baby TV as opposed to the huge, high-definition flat screen in my living room at home. And instead of incense and oil burners creating a beautiful aroma, the smell of weed wafted in through the dorm windows—that’s going to take some getting used to. Falling prey to peer pressure is real y’all, and I’m not gonna get all DRUGS ARE BAD, but making good decisions is hard. The best decision I made on Sunday was to stick through that horrible award show long enough to see Ye. 
Kanye West is my inspiration. Please hold the think pieces and don’t debate me. Something about his quest to die for the art, to be “crucified” by the press, seems noble and genuine to me. Did you know that his album Yeezus was inspired by the designer Le Corbusier? I’ve never been so inspired by a lamp that I recorded an album that’s on another sonic plane, but I hope to be, one day. I stan for Ye (Kanye’s design firm Donda is top of the places I’d love to work one day), but maybe it’s hard to understand why unless you saw his Holy Mountain-inspired show during his tour. 
Still, my relationship with the Idea of Kanye West is complicated. He makes a political body of work like Yeezus which stems from being marginalized as a Black man in the fashion industry, but then undermines all of that work by saying racism isn’t a thing. I laughed when, during his VMA acceptance speech, Kanye described himself as a millennial, maybe it’s just his way of demonstrating that he knows it’s young people who push the culture forward. He’s human and so he contradicts himself, it makes me love him all the more.
Another highlight of the VMAs was Onika Tanya Maraj letting Miley Cyrus know WHAT’S GOOD. That moment is like, literally, me. New York girls are not to be fucked with—even in their $15,000 dresses, best believe that! ♦

Life is like a chameleon that has many colors: Sometimes it looks bright and pretty, at other times it is harsh and dark to the extent that it makes you hate it. The increased intensity of missiles on my afflicted city has resulted in chilling massacres in which nearly 150 people were killed. The security situation was disrupted last week. My two cousins—the children of my only uncle—were among the victims. Before the crisis, we all lived in my uncle’s house and we had a very strong relationship with his children—we grew up together, as siblings. 
I was horrified that they were martyred by one of the missiles that fell on Douma. They were young men, one of them was 15 years old and the other was 17. I called my uncle to try to console him, but I broke down once I heard his sad voice as he mourns the loss of his two children. Their departure has an effect on my life that cannot be ignored; it is another wound to add to my already open wounds, and I am still losing people I love. 
Life has been defeating me. Amidst the cloud of sadness, grief, and pain, I had to do the rent lease procedures alone at the police station, because, as I mentioned before, my mother cannot take a vacation until she has been in her job for three months. Some of the staff were surprised that the lease was under a young woman’s name, especially as I barely look 15 years old. 
I encountered difficulties as I went back and forth between offices, so I asked one of the staff members to help me. After he found out that my father is dead, he asked me to wait until the end of the working day when there are fewer customers. He promised to help me, however I discovered later that he is a despicable person. He asked me to stay only to get close to me. I slapped him in the face, but he threatened to obstruct my apartment leasing procedure. 
I gathered up my courage and went to the police station director’s office, I told him what had happened. The man denied it, of course. The director promised to facilitate my procedures and to punish the staff member. I left the station shocked and wounded. At that moment I felt like I lived in a jungle and humans are monsters, and that it’s necessary for me to be very cautious and attentive.
I honestly hope to leave Syria, because I don’t want to change the way I look at it more than I already have. I don’t want to hate it, and I want to keep my respect for its people. What has this crisis done to us? Has it changed us? Or revealed our masks? I am incapable of finding myself here; there is nothing in Syria now except for humiliation, indignity, and death. ♦

Sometimes I feel like I don’t fit into any categories anywhere. I’m mixed race, black and white. And even as a mixed race person, I look white, so I can’t fit in with a crowd of black people or other visibly mixed race people. So let’s say I wander over to the white part of society, as soon as they find out I’m mixed race I become the token black friend or, even worse, the token “ethnic friend.”
Then, I came out as bisexual. I was always aware of homophobia and transphobia, but biphobia was never something I’d noticed. But how I’ve noticed it now! You forget that queer people can be as just as dismissive and phobic as straight cis people can be to queer people. Perhaps that’s something I can get used to, but being asked by a straight, white, cis boy if I’d be up for a threesome purely because of my sexuality, will always be annoying. 
My learning difficulties also make me feel like I don’t belong when, in education, you’re only noticed if you’re incredibly bright or have a prominent, noticeable learning difficulty. When you’re in the middle of the spectrum, like the majority of people, or have a smaller, less visible learning difficulty, like myself, life and education seem unfair and as though there isn’t a category for you. 
I could go on about the unfair categorisation that goes on with regards to mental health, but you really don’t want to get me started. ♦

I get really nervous before school starts. I can’t eat because my throat is all “hell no,” and then my tummy is all “HELL no.” It twists and turns and flops and I get clammy and everything feels too warm and suffocating. I inevitably start thinking about my third grade science teacher telling us how bad carbon dioxide is. (To this day, I am 100 percent convinced that warm air is carbon dioxide; I can’t even be under my covers too long before thinking, you better watch out for that CO2 man, it’s bad!) I also start sweating on my legs and my lower back and it’s just so gross.
But last week, I started my junior year of high school and I felt fine! My first day felt like any other day at school. Maybe it’s because my first two classes were two of my favorites—French and Computer Science. I had the same teachers I had last year, so I didn’t experience that feeling of not knowing. It makes me think, maybe it’s not knowing what will happen that usually makes me so nervous. Coming in to my first two classes knowing the teacher, my classmates, and what was expected, made it easy.
This year I’m taking Honors English Three, and my teacher is literally all over the place. He sometimes speaks in a weird language similar to pig Latin but with an “f” sound following every syllable. He almost never wears shoes and he plays music over the speakers while he’s talking or while we’re working. So far, he’s played Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, Alt J, Beyoncé, The National, and that band with a song in a Geico commercial. He rides a skateboard up and down the classroom’s center aisle and sometimes he’ll hop on a desk and start yelling—but not in a bad way, I think he’s just really expressive. We also have this classmate named Carliscious who is basically a scarecrow. Truly, he’s a shirt and pants stuffed with hay or something, his head is a kickball with a face drawn on, and he wears a hat. Carliscious is also included in roll call. As wild as my teacher seems, he’s actually really good.
This week, we have an essay to write. So far, nothing I’ve written for this class feels like me. I’ve been trying so hard to sound like I belong in the class, using big words and constructing huge sentences: I was turning in the work I thought my teacher wanted to read. Now that I know there’s a degree of freedom in what we’re doing, it takes a lot of pressure off. Our assignment is to write about A Mercy by Toni Morrison—probably the most difficult book I have ever read. It jumps back and forth in time; perspectives switch without warning; it’s set in the late 1600s (BARF); and it’s about slavery, religion, and mercy. The latter concept is apparently SO important that our prompt for this essay reads, “Should this book be called ‘Mercy’ or ‘A Mercy’?” Like, are you kidding me? That’s so vague! We’ve been provided some background information about why Morrison picked that title, but I guess I’m meant to question whether there’s one big mercy that shapes the entire book or if there are multiple mercies throughout it? Anyway, I’ve been trying so hard to keep up with that class that I skipped the first three days of my honors chemistry class and sat in the bathroom doing English homework instead. (OK, not entirely because I was working so much on my homework, but the chemistry class is at upper campus and it was hot this week!)
Besides all the chaos of my English class, being back at school means getting together with my friends and eating lunch together. In French class, I saw my friend Jasmine, who really makes that class. We are two peas in a pod (actually, pisces—we are pisces in a pod), we just vibe so well together. In all, I’m starting to feel more comfortable with school, and I am having a really good go with life right now. My friends and my work are all coming together. Life feels really solid right now. ♦

I’ve been a college dropout for a semester’s worth of time now, and for the past month, I’ve been working part-time at a market research firm. In between shifts and durimg days off, I take solitary walks around the city, listening to new music, listening to my mind. While this may sound good, it only feels half of how it’s supposed to feel. 
I live in a city where, when you look around, friendships and relationships and all other kinds of “ships” are present. That’s a good thing, but it somehow makes me feel sad and alone. There are nights when all I really need is a person to talk to, laugh with, and touch, but I have no one. There are times when the one I call home is not enough to keep me warm. There are times when my own hand cannot wipe my very own tears. There are times when my words of self-encouragement are not enough for me. There are nights when I experience my inner self cry from loneliness. 
Part of me wants to chastise myself for feeling inadequate and discontent, but is it a sin to feel these things? For two weeks, I have been scribbling the same words in my journal over again: IT IS NOT A SIN TO NEED A HOME IN A COLD, LONELY CITY. As introverted as I am, there are times when I need people—their presence, energy, vibe, aura—to lift me up on days when I feel like floating garbage. It’s sad, though, that when I send out needy, “rescue me” text messages, I get nothing. And when I need to be alone to recharge, people come hustling at my doorstep.
Everything feels and looks unbalanced, unnatural, inorganic. Why are things in my life discordant? Every night, I ask the universe these questions. Every night, still, I get no answer. Or maybe I already have the answer, which I am too stubborn to notice and accept.
While I may suffer too much from demanding more from the universe, I hold on to the hope that all will be OK soon. After all, I can always go back to forgiveness. I know I can always forgive myself. ♦

“We’ll try to get you in for an MRI in the next two weeks,” the doctor says. Until then, she tells me, I should seriously consider going back in an air cast until we get more conclusive results. “It can’t hurt, and it might help.”
And just like that, I’m done.
Last spring I played six games before my ankle took me out of commission. This fall I only made it through one.
And all it took was one sharp deceleration on an uneven patch of turf, one jolt of pain, fleeting, a few minutes of limping around after before finally bowing out for the day. One doctor’s appointment. One scheduled reexamination. One leg in a boot until further notice, and the next day a school full of people exclaiming and demanding to know what happened, what went wrong “this time?!”
My explanation gets shorter and shorter each time I’m asked. “I was in the boot last spring, remember, and didn’t wait long enough before coming back to practice. So it never really got better. It’s been bothering me all season so far, I guess, and when we finally got in to see the doctor she recommended that I go back in the air cast until my MRI. That should be next week, we think.”
Then, “We think it didn’t fully heal in the spring so I’m getting it reassessed. We’re trying to get an MRI scheduled, though, so I can find out what really happened. It might have been a high ankle sprain, those take longer to heal.”
Then, “Yeah, I tweaked it again at practice last week.”
I’m tired of talking about it and dealing with it and having to make excuses for why I can’t play, can’t run, can’t even climb a flight of stairs. I’m tired of not being able to play the sport that I love without that jarring pain that’s almost familiar now. I just want it all to be over. I just want the spring season to come and my fitness along with it. ♦

Life is becoming more and more complicated. It has overwhelmed and confused us. I have become impatient, violent, impulsive, and hateful of life and people.
I have one goal right now: to leave Syria as soon as possible. There are many reasons why I have adopted this goal, but the most important of them is that I cannot realize any of my dreams here. For a long time, I convinced myself that Syria was my country and I should stay, but, unfortunately, it is not a country anymore. It is a group of gangs that ravage people without mercy. What can I say? I am fed up. Our bad financial situation aggravates my mother and her attitude toward us. Our life has shifted dramatically and I believe that my family is on the brink of destruction and loss. My teenage brother is giving us a hard time. My little sister expresses her rejection of our bitter reality by being stubborn and reckless, and our other sister just got married to escape from the whole situation.
After taking many computer courses, my mother finally found a job, but, unfortunately, it did not last–the working hours were too long and the pay was not even enough to cover our rent. She has been trying really hard to improve our situation, but her efforts have been in vain. 
I have to find a way to help my mother. I have not been able to help from here, but if I travel, I might find a good job. The biggest issue that my family faces is money. I never imagined that money could be this important. I feel ashamed that money controls people’s lives, decisions and dreams, but this is the reality that I cannot ignore any longer. Lack of money overwhelmed my mother, forced my sister to get married and travel, and forced me to quit my studies to work. 
I will travel. It does not matter whether it happens legally or illegally. I know that my family needs me with them, but I also know that I can help them better if I find the right opportunity abroad. 
I hate this war and I hate the death that surrounds us and takes away our beloveds, one after the other. I hate the death that recently took my dear friend, when her neighborhood was shelled.
I was stronger at the beginning, but the war has drained me dry. It looks like I cannot continue. I have lost the energy to keep trying again. I believe that it is time for me to leave. ♦

This week at my dad’s has been rough. On the first full day after the switch, we got into an argument (my parents are divorced so I switch houses every week). I can’t even call it an argument, because according to him I’m not allowed to get angry at him, or raise my voice at him, because it’s disrespectful. It turns into me trying to speak, but being cut off by constant tone policing and him yelling over me. 
The issue was that he wanted me to make an appointment for him and I said I would, but I didn’t do it immediately because he didn’t tell me how important it was. In response, he accused me of trying to deliberately sabotage him. That’s so frustrating in itself, but I had also just come back from being with friends, it was only the beginning of the week, and I didn’t want any problems. I tried explaining myself calmly and respectfully, but he turned his nose up at everything. I started crying. Recently, it feels like every week at my dad’s comes with a blow up like this one. I don’t know why it’s happening but it sucks. 
When the argument, which had a lot to do with privacy and power dynamics, finally subsided, I told him that to solve this issue of miscommunication, I’m not going to talk to him as much. Now, close to a week later, I haven’t really spoken to him. In the car, I sit in the back seat rather than the front. I give one-word answers to his questions about my day, when usually, I go on a spiel and throw in odd details, too. When I come home, I go straight upstairs to my room, making it a point to NOT watch Family Feud, which is part of our fun, post-work routine. We haven’t been eating dinner together recently, so when he texts me to say food is ready, I don’t come down until much later. Before, the family would sit down and pick a show to watch and talk about together. It makes me upset that he thinks I’m the one in the wrong, but he’s nowhere close to considering that maybe he messed up. He doesn’t often take accountability for his actions.
That fight hasn’t really impacted the other parts of my life. I’m still able to focus on work and talk to my friends, both of which are really important to me. But being submerged in this negative environment makes so upset that I worry about things not being normal, or not being able to control how sad I am about it. A while ago, I was wondering why a lot of my friends have never seen me cry, especially since I cry a lot (I put this down to being a Pisces). I think I’ve just got such great friends that they can totally turn my mood around. I feel bad talking about family problems anyway; I don’t want to talk about myself too much, or send bad vibes their way. They are dealing with their own things, too.
On a brighter note, I am taking a cool concurrent enrollment course, which means a professor from one of the local colleges comes to our school and we get college credits for this class. It’s like an AP course, but without the stress of an AP exam. (My last AP exam was stressful, but I also rushed through and took a nap the majority of the second half and I still scored a three! Also, the proctor was also hella cute, anyways!!!!). This course is African American history which I know I’m gonna have fun in. Plus, I get to switch to my mom’s house this week, so I won’t have to be here around my dad. ♦

I love the internet. I’ve learned so many things from it, and throughout the years it’s helped me make so many friends. Through it, I get to talk to you all every week, and learn about events and movements. We were always told by parents never talk to strangers, but online, I think we all forgot that piece of advice. My first internet friend was Charlotte, a funny little blonde girl from the Netherlands. We met on a website that connected potential pen pals and we became fast friends. At first, we would talk every day after school—I was 12 or 13 at the time—and Charlotte was a great help and a comfort to me. She always made me laugh and she had intriguing tales to tell in every email. I always felt bad as she spoke English incredibly while I knew no Dutch. Even though we don’t speak anymore, I would like to thank Charlotte for introducing me into the world of the internet. 
Although I should probably add: Don’t give out your information to strangers, online or otherwise. ♦

I keep going—opening up new doors, closing old ones, healing wounds, creating new ones, nursing fires, igniting new ones, and so on.
I started writing poetry again for the first time in two weeks. There are moments in my life that seem to call out from my heart and brain; they beg to be released into words and flow and rhyme, that is, poetry.
I started smoking again.
I started looking everyone intensely and sincerely in the eye, even the men at my workplace. This meant becoming acquainted with a boy whose eyes led my lungs to stifle for a night. He told me yesterday, “There’s something about your hair I can’t quite place,” and that “it’s beautiful” and he “likes it.” I smiled and thought of the boy who broke my heart a year ago, and of how he also used to comment on my hair or my shoes.
I know that I know better.
I am reeling, thinking of all the possibilities that would come my way if I open myself up to the world, but there’s a protective, motherly side to me that wants to protect myself from all the harm this may cause. 
I know that I need this. I need to feel pain every once in a while to remind myself I am alive and incredibly human—bones, flesh, sweat, tears, blood. I know that I need to feel the crushing weight of being alone, and lonely, in order to remind myself of my capacity to attend to my own needs. I need bruises in my body, scratches on my neck, breaks in my nails, to remind myself of my limitations, and at the same time commend my spirit for remaining steadfast amid the destruction.
Destruction is rebirth. As I think of my greatness, I feel my hands tremble. ♦

It’s been a tough week. 
I’m not adjusting to college as quickly as I’d imagined. I had this very specific idea about what college would be for me. A world where I could access: Infinite resources that would allow me new ways to communicate my ideas; people to collaborate with who have similar interests; a newfound sense of self. Now, to be fair, we’re only in week three, but I feel no closer to the fulfillment I’ve been actively seeking since high school. I am unsure if this just is my inner self never being satisfied, or if I should actually listen closely to this unhappiness. 
I brought up the idea of taking a break from college, or maybe attending a less isolated school, with my mom, who just won’t have it. I feel like I’m flying solo on this one. I’m going to have to, “put on my big girl panties” and learn to roll with the punches a bit. Everything isn’t going to go my way, and apparently, I have to ditch my naïveté and realize that the real world isn’t going to afford me the opportunities I want if I’m not a college graduate. I am once again, stuck in a position and unclear of what the outcome should be. 
I owe it to my parents to get a degree, and I’m going to do that. I just feel as if I am never in a position where I am satisfied with myself. Explaining this feeling any further will only cause me to down crying. 
On a positive note, I now have my own college radio show. ♦

I don’t think I’ll ever stop regretting you. I only said yes to becoming your girlfriend because I thought my feelings for you would grow. I kind of thought you could make me feel human. But my feelings didn’t grow, they stayed the same, meaning I still just thought you were a nice boy and that’s all there was to you. Your lips felt like gelid wet sausages trying to absorb my energy and personality for your own gain. It turned me off. I let you a quarter of a millimeter in because I thought it would make me like you if you reacted the right way. You didn’t. 
Instead, you thought my many issues—issues you admitted you could never understand—made me “interesting,” and you liked the fact that I was “dark.” You even said that you were initially enthralled by the idea of me; it made you feel like you were dating a character in a John Green novel or something. 
I am not an idea or cool jaded YA book character. I am Thahabu. My feelings about death, the spirits, my pain, loss, and deformity are not part of some movie script. They are not “interesting” or “deep.” They are my fucking pain and that is not to be admired.
You always told me how strong you thought I was. I never said thank you because I already knew that. Everyone tells me that. My body and mind have endured so much, I know I’m very resilient, but I’m fed up with being told I’m strong. Being strong is tiring. What I wanted you to say was it’s gonna be OK, and it’s OK if I’m sad about the shit I’ve survived, it’s OK to be a girl who thinks about her dead mom every day, but forgets Mother’s Day every year. 
I wanted to be weak, but I was just a character to you, and you were just my immature mistake. I regret you and the time I wasted on you. We ended on good terms and you still wanted to be friends. I said we could be. I lied. I am a harsh woman with a big warm heart and looks that could make a dead man smile; and you are just a child too busy running away from your problems, and living off your mom’s sweat and money. ♦

I feel very stupid.
I was so sad last night. I think this is going to be a weekly thing: falling down and getting back up. I don’t know how long until I fall down and stay down. 
I was sad because I hate being in this place where my vision becomes blurry. I don’t like acknowledging it, because I won’t be able to leave for another two years. When I can’t take it anymore, my mom asks me, “When did this start?” 
I have always seen blurry here; it’s just that I recently realized, in leaving, that it is possible for me to see clearly.
I came to the late-night conclusion that if I was thinner, my problems would be less overwhelming. It’s twisted how I can feel so deeply like giving up during one of my existential crises, and then decide to pick on myself over something as superficial as my body.
The following morning, I stood at the kitchen table for two minutes wondering what to do, the effects of last night lingering like ashes after a fire. To eat, or to eat barely anything? I stood there wondering what was right. When I was sick some years ago, it was so obvious. But now, which choice will make me happy? Which one is the angel or the devil on my shoulder? So hard to see.
On the car ride to school, my stomach hurt so bad but I felt even more stupid. A stupid that I have never ever never felt before, even in my life of failed tests and mistakes and falls and jokes that were never laughed at. I knew I felt worse than if I had been a normal person and had eaten a normal, healthy breakfast.
The stomach pains went away during first period, but the cloud of personal shame didn’t budge. ♦

We’re living in a society where I’m judging you and you’re judging me—for my hair, my skin, the way I dress, as if the clothes I wear make me any less. Do any of these things change who I am, or what I am? Yes these factors are a part of me, but to judge me on something so trivial, so inconsequential, is like judging food on the way it looks, judging covers without reading the books. 
You’re only going skin deep, ignoring the person underneath. So what if I’m black and white, don’t give me attitude because of my weight or height. What I choose to present isn’t all of me, it’s a fraction of a person I intend to be. I’m not calling you out on your judgment, all I’m questioning are your actions. We are all guilty of many things this being one of them. Seeing people you don’t know and thinking of them sluts, seeing a teen with scarred arms and assuming she cuts. That kid on the bus deep in a book, you don’t say it aloud but you’re thinking nerd, the girl that cries on her own just wants to be heard, but you roll your eyes and walk away, she’s a wuss, doesn’t need help, you can’t deal with this today. If you stop for a moment and rethink your judgment you might learn something valuable, make a friend, fall in love. All you need to do is shove away your preconceptions, your prejudice and the notion that you know someone who you know nothing about. 
There are things about all of us that need to be discovered. We don’t carry boards around of who we’ve lost, or keep the pricing of clothes so you know what they’ve cost. We don’t yell from speakers that we’ve been through hell; we just hope one day you’ll be able to tell. On my forehead is not written my existence, my life story, my skills, my persistence. All you can know are the exterior things, the rest is to be discovered. ♦

I am practicing living in the moment.
It’s so ridiculously beautiful how, whenever I’m present, I notice the faint glow the light creates on my grandmother’s dyed hair (the color has faded to plum now and I like it so much); I hear positive voices in my head, howling reinforcements to get me through the day; I become more aware of people’s kindness—how they actually don’t mind going out of their own way just to help someone, even a stranger; I see detective-ish coded glances, winks, smirks, and hand signals; a friend’s commonplace glance now seems to me a declaration of trust.
I marvel at all these. I find these profound, meaningful, lovely little things by mindfully staying in the present moment and stitch them together until I come up with a smorgasbord of human warmth and goodness. Also: Ugh yes, it gets me through some bad days.
Speaking of the present moment: Tonight, I am getting ready to see friends who I haven’t seen in a month and I am hella excited to catch up with them. I’m listening to the The Queen Is Dead, an album by the Smiths, and I find myself dancing.
I can feel the night’s impending magic reverberate in my nerves. ♦

There’s been a three-item list sitting on my nightstand for almost a week. It reads:
1. Ankle arthroscopy
2. Anterior talofibular ligament repair
3. Peroneus brevis tendon tear repair
It is written in the scribbly handwriting of the podiatrist that interpreted my MRI results and looks like a bunch of medical nonsense, but I know all too well what it is. It’s the list of procedures that a surgeon will need to perform on my ankle when I go under the knife this fall.
The podiatrist explained each of the injuries that had shown up on the MRI with a brisk tone and careful fingers prodding at my foot. She reassures us that the surgery is one of the safest and most reliable that they perform—the good news. Then the not-so-good news: It may be up to a month before they can get me on their schedule, and it’s a 10-week recovery plus extra physical therapy. Which puts my return to running, let alone playing soccer, at the beginning of February—at best. Last year my high school team started training on the first of March.
When she left my mom said, “You can cry, you know, it’s okay.”
“I don’t want to,” I said, and walked out of the clinic with a phantom limp and went home and did not cry.
The next day my counsellor asked me if I was scared of the idea of surgery. “No, I’m not scared,” I said, “but I’m angry.” I’m angry that I spent months on the waiting list to even see a podiatrist because that meant that my injury was just getting steadily worse. I’m angry that I wasn’t more careful with it, especially when I started training again 
this fall. I’m angry that the simple “sprained ankle” that brought my junior year season to a very abrupt end is now putting my senior year season in jeopardy almost a year later.
I’m trying to find the silver linings. Without soccer on my schedule this fall, I have more time to work on academics 
and college applications. It’ll be humbling. A learning experience. I’ve never been on crutches before. Maybe it’ll be good for me—recovery, physical therapy, starting from scratch in terms of my fitness. I can do things “right” this time.
But at the same time, I just miss running. I miss the game. And right now February seems very, very far away. ♦

Last week felt really long even though we had Monday off. Every night was a late night and getting up in the morning was such a drag. The night I had to finish my super stressful English essay holds the record for the least amount of sleep—I had a little under four hours. Plus, it was super hot. Beyond hot. 
My most recent late night was on Friday, when I was up until 4 AM watching BuzzFeed videos. Saturday was my half birthday: I’m officially 16 and half now! I celebrated by hanging out with my friends Suze, Tamia, Juliette, and Tasha in the city. Unfortunately, it was really cold—the one day it was cold this week—and we were at the beach. We helped Suze get some shots for her film project, then went to Wholefoods for snacks. We ate in the park, hung out, and decided to rush to Warby Parker to try on glasses. 
The following day, I went to Oakland Pride to watch my sister perform. It’s really different from San Francisco Pride, which is spread out and crowded with a lot of white women wearing rainbow tutus. Oakland Pride is cool and smaller and just so obviously OAKLAND Pride. Dio didn’t come so it was just Sienna and Christina, which was cool because I haven’t been to Pride with either of them before. 
In English class we finished the Toni Morrison book I mentioned last week, and started a novel called The Road by Cormac McCarthy. It’s really creepy. It kept me up one night because I was scared of the setting (post apocalyptic Midwest) and the premise (a road that a man and his son walk along while avoiding cannibals). 
I’m not looking forward to being at my dads this coming week because it’s still kinda rough between us, and I’m not talking to him. I hope things turn around soon. ♦

I started college recently and it’s so amazing. I’ve made friends of all kinds, mainly with the awesome Rachel and James who I’ve hung out with every day. I sat next to Rachel on the first day, she was really friendly toward me and didn’t seem to know anyone, unlike others in the class. The following day I sat with her again, and discovered she was friends with James. I thought he would be a bit intimidating but it turns out he’s actually really sweet. The three of us have been texting daily ever since. 
I’m studying level three Media, which means I get to do all the creative stuff that I’m good at, without failing with an exam at the end. I’m also getting a small qualification in Enterprise which I’m excited about. I’m still not entirely sure what Enterprise is, but so far it seems to be a more fun and creative version of a business course with a smaller qualification. I know we’ll be learning how to create our own businesses, and the work that surrounds that. We had our first lesson today and it was brilliant. I was terrified about the first few days, but now that I’ve settled in and spoken to almost everyone in my class I am genuinely excited. The whole class and staff seem really nice and I hope everyone stays that way.
The only down side to my new college is that instead of it being a 10-minute walk from home, like my school was, it’s a 15-minute walk, 25-minute bus journey, and then another 10-minute walk. Its not as bad as Rachel’s journey: She has to get a lift, a bus, and two trains. 
On a separate note, I’m looking for a second online job. While it would probably be best to get a non-online one, I don’t think I could cope with it. I have improved so much over the year in terms of my anxiety, but it’s still something that I fight with every day and getting a so-called real job would be just be too overwhelming. ♦

In my dreams, I am lost…lost in a labyrinth sprung out of my own mind. Sometimes I think about the kids from my second inpatient stay who were too far gone to be able to ever get any kind of help. Most of them were ruined by bad trips. I fear a similar fate. 
Too often I fall prey to the notion that every single person and thing that I encounter in my life has some kind of connection to me, is a representation of a possible outcome for me. I think it’s me worrying too much. I can’t tell what’s worse, the awful nihilistic attitude I had before or this. Maybe it’s good that I’m worried about myself. 
I hate waking up early every morning but I find things that make days even more worth it: Dark Side of the Moon is my new favorite album, Twin Peaks is my new favorite show, and Babes in Toyland is my new favorite band. I am surrounded by newness and I feel so lucky! But why do we, as humans, feel the need to ridicule anyone who expresses obvious enjoyment or excitement or gratefulness the way I am doing? I find myself monitoring my own words for any sign that I’ve come off as naive or childish and find none. Happiness should really be seen as a beautiful thing, not a pitfall that makes us any less interesting or able to maturely process things. 
This is supposed to be a recollection of my own thoughts and my own week but I can’t help but add this: Find moments to appreciate living. Find at least one thing that makes you happy and hold onto it like there’s no tomorrow. Unlearn cruelty. Savor your own existence when you can. ♦

Saturday, 8 PM: My excuses are polite and my elbows are sharp and that’s what gets me to the very front of the crowd, just underneath the stage, mixed in with everyone who’s been camped out for hours. “Lilly, there’s room over here,” one of my friends yells as I approach them, and I squeeze into their space feeling a little guilty about my height. It’s all worth it, though, when I offer the much shorter girl behind me my place in the second row, and her eyes go wide and she says “Really?!” and then, “Thank you!” I can see over her head, anyway, but I feel the warmth of the crowd beneath my ribcage now. I belong.
And I’m just in time, because only minutes after I find my place, the lights go blazing and the crowd goes wild.
“We are stranger than Earth,” sings Megan James of Purity Ring, “With her seasons misled / Stronger than her moods…”
She wears mirrored gloves that reflect the light show at all angles, turning her image on my camera to a fuzzy outline in neon colors. When her hands are wrapped around the microphone she is just a silhouette backlit by a spectral glow.
“Again, again, again, I wasn’t thinking about you,” the crowd chants for her, and she is so close that I feel like I could reach out and touch her.
“Look, everyone!” she calls out during an instrumental, pointing over our shoulders. “Look at the moon!” 
The moon is very close to full—the long-awaited “supermoon” is the following day—and even behind a screen of cloud it’s bright enough to cast a pale glow on her face as the song ends and darkness falls across the stage. We do not turn to look at the moon. We have eyes only for her.
“You be the moon / I’ll be the Earth / And when we burst / Start over oh, darling / Begin again, begin again.” ♦

Nothing eventful has happened this week: If anything, it’s been kind of trash. I got sick, broke my MacBook, and found out that The Bletchley Circle won’t be renewed for a third season. I loved The Bletchley Circle. I’m secretly a grandmother who enjoys watching BBC period dramas and documentaries. I recently watched a good one on the history of funk music in the ’70s. I have an affinity for black American culture of any time period, so it was a great watch. Also, Larry Graham of Sly & the Family Stone and Graham Central Station is the uncle of THE Aubrey Graham. That’s cool as hell. I’m fed up more than ever with college and in search of a hustle to make enough money so I can drop out. I might have to start selling Fit Tea on the gram like Amber Rose and them. Pray for your girl. ♦

For Jordan
You are gardens.
I say gardens plural not singular,
Because you’re too vibrant and resilient to just be one.
You’re made up of the most ethereal pastel roses,
And the brightest sunflowers,
Ain’t no way you just one.
Your soil keeps you grounded,
But you rise even from the toughest concrete,
And stick it through the worst droughts.
You are colorful gardens,
Among a dying field crop. ♦

My therapist is kind. She lets me talk and talk and talk, only steering the conversation in a different direction when my words screech to a halt and I settle into a jumble of muttered so, yeahs. I don’t know if I’ll stay with her. She asks me a lot of questions about school and how that relates to my anxiety as if she thinks there’s something I’m not telling her. But by the end of today’s session I felt like I was just repeating myself. She might try a different approach next week. I’ve only had two hours with her so far, after all.
In back-to-school icebreaker games or in lieu of the generic “interesting fact about yourself,” I remember being asked the question: If you could say one thing and have the entire world hear you, what would it be? Sometimes it had “without repercussions” or something similar tacked on at the end. I’ve been thinking about that a lot lately. I still don’t know what my One Thing would be, but it’s been—well—therapeutic to be able to say whatever I want without repercussions. Even with the people I love, I’m constantly editing what I say before it pops out of my mouth. And in most cases that’s a good thing. But sometimes the voices I usually restrain need to be heard too. ♦

Dear reader, we’re in real countdown numbers now. The kind that everyone chants waiting for the ball to drop on New Year’s Eve. Or maybe the kind that precedes the lift off of some mountainous space vessel perched on its launch pad. I always thought the Times Square tradition was a little anticlimactic anyway.
But if school years fizzle at their ends, then summers’ flame. Everything seems to be accelerating right now: My fall soccer season kicked off (ha) this week; I got my finalized schedule for this school year in the mail today; colleges are already tapping me on the shoulder via email to remind me about their application deadlines. I’m scrambling to figure out how I’m going to fit in therapy, my internship, and possibly, maybe, even a social life amongst training sessions and homework.
Hopefully that’ll all come to light next week. But for the next few days, all I can do is steel myself for the storm.
Over and out. ♦

It’s the first time I’ve spoken to her in over a year. She holds my hand for a minute and talks about how strange it’s been, coming back. “I have German next and I’m worried I’ll mix it up with Turkish,” she tells me. Thinking about the moment now, I struggle to recall if she still has that mole on her cheek, like she kept one side of her face turned away for the entire conversation. But her smile is as broad and her eyes as bright as I remember them.
First days of school tend to highlight how we’ve all changed over the summer. But this year, for the most part, my classmates look the same; we’ve outgrown the years where we grew three inches in a single summer, or got our braces off to reveal unrecognizably toothy smiles. It’s my last year of seeing these people every weekday morning, but I don’t feel the comforting familiarity that I should. Only distance. Four years together and I am more remote than ever. ♦

There are things we wish for, but when our wishes come true we begin to see the cracks in our best hopes. I hoped for my mother to get a job, but her daily absence created a big gap in the house because her hours are very long, lasting from 9 AM to 4:30 PM—plus the two hours she spends on the road due to the difficulty in travelling to work. After an arduous trip, she returns home exhausted and unable to do any housework, so it becomes our duty to help her, and since I’m the eldest, I have considerable responsibilities on my shoulders, doing things I didn’t even know how to do beforehand, like cleaning, laundry, and cooking. I started cooking food with the little experience I had.
These simple chores are not the real problem; there are much more difficult tasks that took me by surprise. This week, for example, the security situation in our area was very unstable, and our home was subjected to an early morning raid. I was really scared when I saw the police, especially because my mother and my brother had left for work, and my sister and I were alone, but I kept my myself calm. They requested our rent for the month, and unfortunately we were late in renewing the contract, so they took some important papers that we had to go to the police station to retrieve. My mother is a new employee, and was not allowed to leave her job, so I had to go along with our landlord to collect the papers and renew the contract. I felt very uncomfortable there, because girls do not frequent these places. To make matters worse, we discovered that we were required to pay a sum of money in the form of a bribe to the employees, since all state-related transactions require bribes, due to the laxity and negligence in government institutions following the crisis in Syria. It is truly a pity that we have lost our principles and morals. It was vital that the paperwork to be recovered but I wasn’t able to do it. I’m so exhausted by these responsibilities, but I realize that I don’t really have a choice but to help my mother, and my desire to do so eases the burden.
The second camp for special prosthetics will be held soon, and my friends and I decided to participate because it will increase our expertise and support our field of study. But it also adds to my list of responsibilities, and I’m concerned about organizing my time between home, work, and camp. It feels really difficult to manage my time well, especially with the heatwave sweeping Syria this year, which almost strangled us, in addition to severe water shortages lasting several days in houses in Damascus. The extreme heat and lack of water makes me want to lash out at everybody around me. Our hearts can no longer tolerate this. Our lives do not resemble respectful human existence. I wish I could live with dignity in my homeland. That is my biggest wish. ♦

A few weeks ago I wrote about fitness from scratch and how working out is such a big part of my life—but recently it hasn’t been. Not in the way I probably make it sound. Beyond soccer practice three days a week and a couple of easy bike rides here and there, I haven’t been doing what I should be, especially if I want to run my school-required 5K in the next month. Except somewhere along the line “next month” became “next week” and “next week” became “this weekend” and that’s right, everyone, I’m going to run a 5K this Saturday.
The injuries I’ve suffered over the past year have taught me mixed lessons about running. Nasty blisters on my heels helped me start anticipating small injuries and preventing them from worsening. My hip and back injuries taught me that nothing feels better than a painless run after months of wincing on every other step. But my sprained ankle has done nothing but make me fear the run. I think it’s because it happened in one identifiable moment, an instant of powerful acceleration gone wrong that ended with me in a heap on the ground, clutching at my leg in the kind of pain I hadn’t felt in years. Now my skin prickles every time I feel a pinch in my ankle, knowing that any re-injury now might sideline me for yet another season.
But if I want to play this fall, I have to overcome that. I can’t be scared of my own body anymore. I’ll finish this 5K and have another go at one in August if I want to improve my time. I’ll try to take my own advice: Bodies are amazing and mine can do anything. I just need to put in the work. ♦

Last week I went ziplining with my cousins. I’ve only gone once before, two or three years ago, but I still remember it clearly. This time, there were no nerves walking up to that first line, only the rush of adrenaline and joy when I stepped off the platform and into the abyss. The harness holds you easily, and for 30 seconds you’re responsible for nothing but floating in the empty air.
Yesterday the U.S. women’s national soccer team won the World Cup for the first time in 16 years. This morning I asked myself if my favorite player would still be lying in bed wasting the hours like I was, then rolled out of bed and into my cleats. It’s good to feel that motivation again.
I’m visiting two more colleges with my best friend this weekend. We half joke about what a dream it would be if we ended up at the same school, drawing up fake workout plans and hiking trips in lazy conversation. For a while I tried to start notebooks and spreadsheets to record which schools I visited and which schools I planned on applying to and which schools I had the best chance of getting into. But I keep track of things the best when they’re in my head, not written down.
The future feels very open and very unknown right now: There are infinite directions it could go, some of them only if I take the initiative to lead it there. But things make more sense than they used to. Right now, I don’t feel so afraid. ♦

Sometimes, little things can have a big influence on our lives. My sister’s engagement brought a smile to our faces and color to our lives. But because her engagement party will cost a significant amount of money, I have to cut my vacation time short and go back to work. Our working hours have changed in the month of Ramadan, so we now work from 4 PM to 11:30 PM. My mother did not like me working so late. She insisted I take some time off after what happened to me.
One night the electricity cut off while I was on my way home. The streets were so dark that I had to use my phone’s flashlight in order to see my way. A man came out of nowhere and grabbed me. I was not sure whether he wanted to steal my purse or do something else. Fortunately, I had the strength to scream, fight back, and run home. When I told my mother what had happened, she was frightened for me and said that I had to take the rest of the month off, until our working hours return to normal.
I don’t blame her. The security situation is very bad and the streets are not safe anymore. Sometimes, I blame it on the lack of electricity, because honestly I had not felt unsafe before this incident. During the month of Ramadan, the streets are usually busy until midnight—especially now, because Eid al-Fitr (the holiday festival of breaking the fast) is coming soon and people are out late at night shopping in preparation for the festivities. It is the time to buy new clothes, sweets, and presents. The streets are busy, the shops are open late, and people are out living their lives normally—but everybody is alert. We are not accustomed to normal life any more. Everybody is worried that something bad will happen soon.
I love my work, but education is my top priority; it’s what will help me find my place in this world. I took some of my exams last week. They all went well and I am hoping that the ones coming up will go well, too. My grades in lab classes are much better than my grades in theoretical classes, but I am not worried, because lab work is more important in my field.
I can’t wait to graduate and finally work in the field I love—I feel I will be very creative and successful. I’m sure you sense how optimistic I am today. I can’t explain it. It feels like I am on a boat that keeps oscillating between happiness and sadness, between light and darkness, without any reason. One day, I feel that I have everything I could dream of—a great family, lovely friends, a job, and education. Another days, I feel that all of this doesn’t matter, and that I am deprived of my most basic rights. I was looking out of the window today and I thought that life was like a speeding car. People run as fast as they can, as if they are racing time. I realized that I should go faster and work harder or I will be left behind.
P.S. Maybe I am feeling hopeful and optimistic because of Ramadan. ♦

The anticipation and excitement surrounding Eid [the feast of breaking the fast] is showing already in the city. The streets are teeming with people, the shops are open day and night, and the smell of Eid sweets wafts out of the bakeries. This atmosphere reminded me of the old days, when I used to go with my family to al-Hamidiyya market to buy new clothes for Eid. I suddenly felt that all I wanted was to relive those old moments again, so on a whim, I asked my friends if they wanted to go to the market with me, and they loved the idea. Al-Hamidiyya market used to be full of tourists from all over the world, but because of the war, they have vanished.
We walked around the market and bought some little things. Most of my friends are, like myself, displaced and cannot afford to do any serious shopping. So each of us bought one thing—a pair of shoes, a purse, some perfume. I loved the time that I spent in the market and I enjoyed watching the licorice drink seller in his traditional costume and red hat. We also entered the Umayyad mosque located on the far side of the market. We stayed there for an hour, praying that our country might escape from the misery it is going through. After that, we ate some of the famously delicious ice cream at a shop called Bekdash, then we bought some candy, and I bought a book. I did not find a book that I really liked, but I bought one anyway, because I wanted to continue an old family tradition of ours—we always ended our trip to the market with a new book.
I was very excited, hopping from one shop to another, and my friends followed me wherever I went. I did every little thing that I used to do with my family on our pre-feast trips to al-Hamidiyya market. Reliving this experience provided me with happy energy. For the first time in two years, I felt that I had the inner force to embrace the past. Maybe I am finally able to overcome the negative impact that the war has had on me. Something in me is changing for the better.
We stopped at a checkpoint on our way back, and they detained us for almost two hours. My friends called their parents but, not wanting to worry her, I didn’t call my mother. The officers at the checkpoint conducted a thorough search of everything we’d bought. They were annoyingly slow, and it looked like they were having fun while my friends trembled with fury. At the start, we did not understand why we were being searched, but later we realized that we were stopped and searched because we are from eastern Ghouta [an opposition-controlled area in the suburbs of Damascus]. Sometimes, I wish I could change the place of birth on my identification card, but of course, I can’t—and honestly, I don’t really want to. I am very proud of who I am: a displaced girl from eastern Ghouta.
Strangely enough, what happened did not change my mood. I was still happy and excited when I got home. Have I gotten used to tragedy or have I overcome it? This simple visit to the market gave me strength and reminded me that nothing is impossible—I wanted to live one day of happiness, and I did. After all I have been through, if I can be happy for one full day, then nothing can stop me from being happy all the time. I will realize the peace and happiness that I dream of. I know that I can. ♦

Sometimes strange things happen, and we cannot prove or explain them. We only know and accept that they happened.
On the first night of Eid, I had a beautiful dream. I saw my father smiling at me. He patted my shoulder and caressed my hair with his warm hand. I felt his warmth flowing in my blood. The strange thing was that when I opened my eyes, I saw him. For a few moments, his face was everywhere I looked. 
This has happened to me every first night of Eid since I lost my father. You might think this is just a dream, but I know it is not. I know that his spirit visits me to assure me that he is with me despite his physical absence. I miss my father!
After seeing him, I stayed in bed for a little while, and accidentally stuck my hand under the pillow, and to my surprise, I found an Eid present. I was super excited. I woke my siblings up, and they also found presents under their pillows. Our financial situation is very bad and we never imagined that we would get presents this year. Having presents had always been a family tradition until last Eid. Last Eid was very hard on us. We spent Eid alone, because my mother was trapped in the besieged city of al-Ghouta.
I always loved Eid presents. When I was little, I believed that angels hid Eid presents under my pillow if I had been a good girl. But later on, I realized that it was my mother. She was our angel. Presents were usually something we badly wanted: a watch, a doll, or a nice ring, but, of course, our presents this year are very simple. I got mascara that I saw in a shop few days ago and really liked. My two sisters got sunglasses and my brother got some hair gel and a hairbrush. He’s been taking care of how he looks recently, and my mother realizes how much such little things mean to him at his age.
We were extremely happy with our presents. I love this tradition, and I will, as a mother one day, do the same thing with my children. We spent most of Eid this year together. It was great family time and the city was relatively quiet.
My siblings and I have grown a lot recently. We’ve experienced things that others don’t experience in a lifetime. The war has made us stronger and taught us that happiness is not given—it is earned. On the first day of Eid, my siblings and I went to a nice café and had some beverages. We had not been to a playground in years, so we decided to visit one. Playgrounds are particularly full during Eid. We played on swings and slides, like little kids. We had so much fun that we forgot our struggles. The second day, I went with my friends to a beautiful park. We had great conversations and we spent our time laughing and having fun. We tried to spend as little money as possible. My friends are, like me, displaced and their financial situation is not good. Maybe this is why I feel comfortable around them.
On the third day of Eid, my family and I spent the time visiting family and neighbors. My uncle lives in a far away in a relatively unstable neighborhood. My mother did not want to go back home late at night, so we spent the night there. We had a blast, because my cousins are the same age as we are. We stayed up all night talking and laughing. 
Despite the great time I had this Eid, one thing kept troubling me: my loved ones who are trapped in al-Ghouta. I could not stop thinking of them and the hard life they are living. I miss that city. Despite all that is happening there and despite the fact that everything we know there is destroyed, I still love and miss al-Ghouta. I will close my eyes and make a wish: May my family always be safe and be around me. May safety and stability return to my beloved country and to my city. Who knows; maybe dreams will come true this year. ♦

If a jinn spirit were to ask me what I wish for, everyone might think I would want the old, peaceful Syria back. But actually, that would not be my wish. I’ve realized that, right now, it is even beyond my wishes and dreams. Everything just keeps getting worse, and so I’ve adjusted my dreams to suit my reality.
I’ve been trying to make peace with my new, deviated world, so I decided to give myself a break and go out with friends to a restaurant in a beautiful park nearby. The view of the trees and the sound of the water helped me feel much better. I felt like my soul was finally breathing and that I was alive again. But, unfortunately, this feeling did not last long. When the bill arrived I was shocked at the number and realized that I had made a huge mistake. I paid my entire salary for that meal. When I got home I was very upset and embarrassed. My family laughed at me. My mother tried to cheer me up and told me that happy moments can’t be measured in money. Her words made me feel a little better, but despite her efforts, I spent that night trying to figure out how I would survive for the rest of the month. It looks like the price of a few moments of happiness is a whole month of suffering.
It is very hard to change who you are. I tried to abandon all my desires and needs, but I did not succeed. I’m still the same girl who loves life and desires all kinds of things, big and small. I still enjoy buying a new dress or shopping with friends.
I have always wanted to learn new things, to better my language and computer skills, but since I work only part time, I can’t afford to enroll in courses. For example, two months ago, I signed up for an English course and made the first payment, but I had to stop going to classes because I couldn’t afford the additional payments. I also wish I could get a degree in computer science.
I feel that I’m shackled and I can’t move forward. I’ve recently been so desperate to find an exit from my reality that I’ve tried things I used to consider silly. For instance, one time I played the lottery, and another time I went with a friend to a fortune teller. One thing that has changed in me and truly worries me is that I’ve been feeling a twinge of envy at people’s happiness and I don’t want this feeling to consume me.
But I will never give up and I will never stop dreaming. I know that I have not been able to realize my dreams, but I also know that I am a fighter and that I have a great family that encourages and supports me. I always keep Shakespeare’s famous line in mind, “to be or not to be, that is the question,” and I know that one day I will be. ♦

I love reading and I love writing. At times, writing is hard. Writing about real things is harder, which is why I like to turn pieces of life into a story—it makes everything appear shiny and embellished. You can make the simplest walk to the shop an adventure by simply adding the way you walked and the thought going through your head. Now when I’m tragically bored or in need of some inspiration I do the following: Go to a word generator that gives you random words, get five random words. Then, in the space of five minutes write a short story, or whatever it is you feel like writing at the time, using these five words. My five words today are: forgotten, envelope, habit, brother, pink.
Five minutes on the clock, GO!
I don’t have a brother or, for that matter, a sister. It’s just my parents and me. People expect me to be selfish or spoiled because I’m an only child, but I don’t see why. I guess if we follow the stereotype, I would have been a brat of a child and had everything I ever wanted. I’m not going to lie and say my parents never gave me anything because they did, all the time, but not because I begged or moaned; I seem to have picked up this quite useful habit of having manners. 
When I was seven, I wanted this baby doll with a face that moved. I thought it was the most beautiful and clever thing that I had ever seen; it wore pink overalls and came with a pretend adoption certificate placed loosely in a yellow envelope. I wanted this doll so badly for months and months, and every now and then I would ask my mum if I could buy her. She would always tell me to wait until Christmas to see if Santa planned on giving her to me. Of course, when Christmas finally arrived I had forgotten all about the doll in the pink overalls. That didn’t stop me from being the happiest child in the world when I unwrapped the large box and found her inside. I am now 17, it’s been 10 years since that Christmas, and the doll is probably sitting in the loft somewhere, broken and stained, but I will always remember that as the best present ever.
OK, I digress: I used up 10 and not five minutes. But you see the beauty of this exercise is that once you’re five minutes in, you often can’t stop and you end up writing something anyway. ♦

Fear and anxiety hang over us and hang over our homes, defining our relationships and how we communicate. This might be because it is finals week—my sister’s finals started last week, and I’m very worried about her. In addition to the heavy and dense curriculum, she struggles with some subjects and, unfortunately, her teachers are not well-qualified.
The finals, of course, are not the only reason for our stress—everything around us intensifies it. Two days ago, I went with my mother to see the apartment that we’ll be moving to at the end of the month.
I was shocked. The neighborhood is located between two battlefronts. The apartment burned after a missile hit the building. Once I entered the place, my heart trembled and I closed my eyes. The place was a wreck. Everything was black, and it had no doors or windows. In order to live in this place, we would have to clean it, paint it and repair all the electrical wiring, as well as the plumbing. It is not suitable to live in, but we have no other choice. The rent we pay right now is too high and we can’t afford it anymore.
Many displaced families moved to that neighborhood, and we will not be the only family in the building. The other families might be worse off than we are. It is startling how we’ve become no more than pawns—circumstances beyond our control dictate the course of our lives. The situation is too bad to be true. I sometimes think that this must be a nightmare, and that I will wake up soon. Will my mother’s warmth and support help us get used to the new place? I truly doubt it.
My relationship with my siblings is getting worse, because we are all stressed out and we find it very hard to cope. But what frustrates me the most is that I will have to quit my job because the new place is too far from where I work. I love my job. It provides me with strength and confidence. It is where I meet new people and do something. Last week, for example, I managed our booth in an exhibition where we presented some of the electrical appliances we carry in the store. I enjoy my work despite how tiring it is. It is the only thing that provides me with optimism. 
I am a pawn on a chessboard that is stuck in the black squares. Everything around me is dark. My destiny is dark and I am tired of it. ♦

Rapid and unpredictable change in our lives creates many challenges.
I am writing about our new apartment, which some may see as a trivial issue, but it greatly affects our lives in a very negative way. In an attempt to prepare us for the new place, our mother took us there for a visit. One of my sisters could not join us, because she was busy with her exams. After seeing the apartment, my little brother was shocked, and he expressed his anger with hurtful words, whereas my little sister was silent as she gazed sadly at the place.
Our mother tried to cheer us up. She said that we would cover the holes in the walls with pictures of flowers and birds so that the place would look like a little garden. She said that we could stay up at night and watch the stars from the room in which the wall had been destroyed. Her smile was fake. Her voice was shaking and had an apologetic tone. The bottom line is that we must accept the new place simply because we have no other choice.
Every corner in this place tells a story of injustice and oppression. The ceiling is ruined and the burned walls carry scars that the bullets have left behind. How is it possible to find stability and comfort in this place? Day after day, our most basic rights are ripped away from us.
Despite my own hopelessness and frustration, I felt that, as the oldest sister, I had a duty to help my siblings accept the new situation and to make my mother feel that we appreciated her effort. But deep inside me I feel that it is all a big lie. I constantly lie about how I feel. I put a fake smile on my face and act normal while I am very depressed. I do this with my friends, with my family, and even with myself. I tell myself that everything is going to be fine, but I know that is not true.
I was the first to protest against the new apartment, and I admit that I said some crazy things, but when I realized that I had no other choice I succumbed and accepted it, despite all its negatives. I know that as soon as we move there we will face many new challenges. It is far from where I study and work and I will have to stop at many checkpoints every day, which is really scary but I tell myself: If you can’t change your life, you can at least change your behavior towards it. Think positively. Your positivity should give you strength and resilience. As Dr. Robert Schuller said: “What happens to you does not matter. What matters is what you make of what happens to you.” ♦

My old diary entries are a time machine. Ice cubes melt into my mocha as I scroll through them, paging through memories of last summer. Some are still vivid—I’ll never forget Ireland. Others—pool parties, flying kites with friends—have faded, not lost, just dim. I talked about coming back to school and junior year being THE BIG YEAR, the standardized tests and the college admissions process looming over my head.
Now all of these things are very real. With less than a month left in my junior year, my grades are pretty much dependent on how well I do on my final exams. I now know the test scores that I’ll be sending in with my college applications. And speaking of those, the other day I went to a session with my school’s college counselor on the Common App and how to begin navigating it so we’ll be able to start right away come August. (Do I sound prepared or what?!)
In some ways the future is more frightening that it was a year ago, and in others it’s less so. A year ago, I would never have imagined that my future as a *Woman in Science* would be uncertain, but that was before I sat through months of calculus and physics classes that I rarely found myself enjoying. A year ago, I refused to label any of my passions as “minor,” constantly battling the idea that I would eventually have to choose between them. A year ago, I was thinking to myself, I still have two whole years of high school left.
Now I know that while a career in science is still a viable option, I have other academic interests—linguistics, journalism, women’s studies—that I’m just as likely to go further in. I know that I’m not going to play varsity soccer in college and I’ve accepted that. (I’ll just have to make time to be a fan instead.) I know that I’ve only got a little over a year left at this high school, maybe in this town, and that year is going to fly by.
Sometimes I miss the confidence I used to have, but lately I’ve realized that I just have a different kind now. A year ago I knew exactly what I wanted to do with my life and no clue how to do it. Now I have no idea what I’m going to make of my future—but I know how I can get there, one way or another. ♦

It’s that time of year again when everything seems like it’s in free fall, spiraling toward the end of the school year and the false allure of yet another lazy summer. Those nothing-filled days of seasons past will be a little more elusive this year. I’m seeking out summer jobs—a teenage rite of passage in themselves—and volunteering opportunities. If I can work out my schedule for next school year in time, I could be taking an intensive Portuguese class at the local university come fall semester, and I’ll need to prep for that. I’m going to finally put in my hours behind the wheel and try to get my driver’s license. I’m going to fully rehabilitate my ankle and spend my mornings readying myself for my next competitive season, especially if that comes at the end of this year rather than in the spring of next.
My English course this semester is on the coming-of-age novel, so in class we’ve been talking about the entire concept of “coming of age” and how we each perceive it. One of the hottest debates, predictably, is whether coming of age can be described in a single moment, or even a series of moments, or whether it’s a subtler shift that takes place over time, best viewed in hindsight. I’m not sure what my stance on the matter is. I feel like I’ve had a lot of experiences—and many more ahead of me—that could be viewed as my coming-of-age moments. But I still don’t feel like it’s happened. I don’t feel like I’ve come of age. I’m chasing all these loose ends this summer like maybe I’m hoping one of them will lead me to some definitive future and I’ll be slapped in the face with a sense of maturity and adulthood.
There are things that only my journals and Spotify playlists know. I think they might know me better than I do myself.
(This entry has been a little confusing for me, too.) ♦

The second semester exams are getting closer, and I must pass them if I want to move on to the second year.
I’m so scared and worried; I haven’t been giving studying enough time because of the millions of other things on my mind. I know I need to reach some peace of mind to go on but I can’t seem to find comfort anywhere—not even in school, although it was my desire to study there. I’m losing interest and my sense of achievement; so many things happen in school that affect me badly. Like the other day, a friend of mine was expelled because she had unintentionally broken one of the medical items and couldn’t afford to pay for it because she’s a displaced person. This disturbed me a great deal because I know how hard she fought to get into this medical school.
I feel like I’m living in a jungle of beasts, and this has allowed hatred and grudges to sneak into my heart.
Something inside me is changing. I’m becoming tougher and more ruthless and, believe me, this is happening against my will. Everyone else around me has changed, too. It’s like a virus has infected everyone with corruption and dishonesty, so I can’t find peace anywhere I go—not at school, not in the street, not at work. 
You can see misery and horror on every face. Maybe it’s the current security situation caused by the crisis, which has surely affected everyone, without exception. Or maybe it’s the rapid increase in prices that drives people mad, especially now that the crisis has extended to transportation costs, which have suddenly doubled in price. This issue has caused resentment among students and employees. I now have to spend half of my income on transportation. This is too much for me and for every Syrian citizen in these currently brutal circumstances.
At home with my family I keep getting this feeling that something is collapsing inside us. I know it’s because we have all run out of tolerance. Lately we’ve all been very stressed and unwilling to listen to each other. 
During the crisis, I have become full of worries about things that are beyond my experience. Sometimes I get determined and I try to put all kinds of positive ideas in my head, but they fade away gradually in the face of all these challenges. I am also the oldest child in a fatherless family, which puts a great responsibility on my shoulders, and is more of a burden than I can handle. How could I possibly not worry about the exam?!
Last week my mother got sick, so I was in charge of the house and the family. It was a scary experience that made me decide never to add marriage to my burdens—unlike some of my friends, who are seeking marriage to run from their painful reality. Life has become full of sorrows with very few joys, and I’m getting tired of it. What makes me even more worried is that my mother is considering moving somewhere else, just as I got used to this place. In spite of all its flaws, what can I say…I’m sick of running around looking for the peace and safety that don’t really exist in this world, although no human being can live without them. I feel like a corpse. So isn’t it natural that I feel this way about the exam considering the mess I’m living in?
Aren’t safety and stability crucial factors for success? That’s all I need, but I finally realized that reaching safety and peace would not be easy, though perhaps not impossible. But I’m only a human being with limited abilities. What can I possibly do in such a contaminated environment that can provide me with nothing? ♦

Marah
Many of our dreams have disappeared. The only dream that remains is our dream of surviving this crisis, which has stripped us of our rights and our dignity. Our feelings are crystallized in one word: fear. We are more afraid every day.
The beginning of last week was relatively quiet. My friends, teachers and I held a goodbye party for the two artificial limb specialists who visited Syria and shared their expertise and great knowledge with us. Grilled meat, kibbeh, stuffed vine leaves and many other Syrian dishes were served at the party. Our guests politely refused to eat fatty foods, and they were surprised that we eat such unhealthy food. It made me realize that we lack awareness about health in our society. I remembered a saying that our neighbor always said: “The shortest way to a man’s heart is through his stomach.” Not all of our customs are bad. We have some great ones, or, let me say, we used to have some great customs. Women used to enjoy unique respect in our society. People used to give women priority, even in the most everyday places, like on a bus or in a store. Now I have to push my way through men in order to get on the bus at all. This is a very small example of how the crisis has affected our society.
Back to last week, which ended badly when my sister, who is currently preparing for her finals, almost had a nervous breakdown while arguing with our mother about her need for a tutor. I feel very bad for my sister. She has devoted her life to reading and to studying. Even during the Syrian crisis, she didn’t abandon her studies. She believes that education is the only thing that will get her out of this abysmal and deteriorating situation, but no one understands her or helps her.
I remember an article I read that discussed the basic needs of human beings. While the article listed food, water, and air as basic needs, it also listed safety, stability, and self-realization. We don’t have access to the most basic of those needs, to the fundamentals that we need in order to survive, not to mention stability and self-realization. I understand that no matter what I say, you will not grasp the reality that we live in. I myself never imagined such a life was possible until everything was taken away from me.
Fear has surrounded us for years, and it slowly kills everyone who lives here. We are scared of everything: the past, today, and the future. I am scared for myself, for my family and for my country, which I still love. I wish I could leave, but my love for my country stops me. I have cried a lot over what is happening in my country, but it was all in vain, so now I keep quiet or talk to myself. ♦

The air feels thick and heavy in my lungs today. I take deep, shaky breaths as I jog through warm-ups with my team, pausing when I need to cough—hard—bending at the waist, my shoulders hunching to contain the noise in the crook of my elbow. There’s nothing to do but let the spasms travel through my chest and knock open my airways. My teammates try not to look at me. I try not to cough as loudly. 
On the soccer field I’m quite the presence. I’m always the one screaming for a pass across the pitch, or ripping off shots like I don’t know my own strength, or pulling that last 20-yard sprint out of nowhere to make a crucial play. I pour myself so wholeheartedly into the game that when my voice is silenced and my strength sapped I don’t know what to do with myself, how to react, how to adapt. It’s like I only have two settings, with nothing in between “It took me 20 minutes to crawl out of bed this morning” and “I am a raging athletic beast who will stop at nothing.” 
I’m sent to train with our junior varsity team for the day and told not to push it—we have a game tomorrow, I need to be healthy. “Only do what you can,” my coach says. But I don’t take kindly to that phrase. I can do a lot of things on the field—whether it’s a good idea for me to do them is a different story. 
Maybe I shouldn’t have practiced today. Maybe I should have sat out the keep-away games and shooting drills rather than risk making my cold any worse. My problem is that I can’t find the balance between “I can do this” and “I have to do this”—I could be letting it harm me in the long run. ♦

Soccer isn’t the right sport for everyone. It’s heavily team-based, which doesn’t appeal to some athletes. It involves using your feet a lot more than your hands, something many of my friends would cringe at the thought of. But I wish I could lace everyone up in my cleats, just for a moment​,​ and let them feel the joy and relief that I felt last weekend when I finally put the ball in the net for the first time this season.
Last spring I was a force of nature on the field: I notched a hat trick—three goals in one game—and numerous other goals, and tied a teammate for varsity top scorer. I played fun, scrappy, happy-go-lucky soccer, popping in crosses and assisting my teammates whenever I could, relying on my size and stamina to make things happen on the field.
This year I am stronger and speedier, made powerful by months of weightlifting and physical therapy. I am much more intense, and it shows in the way I scream for the ball whenever I see an opportunity, in the way I am the first to complete our burpees and hill sprints even if I have to stumble off to find my inhaler afterwards. It shows in the three clinical touches I took to bury the ball in the goal on Saturday: one to control it out of the air, one to evade a defender, and one to send it skidding past the keeper from 20 yards away. I didn’t even wait to watch the ball go in. I knew it would. I had already turned around and started jogging back to the center of the field, hiding a smile, hungry for another. ♦

Lately, I’ve been almost overwhelmed by the sheer weight of what I have to accomplish over the next few months—finding a summer job, and starting college applications. But breaking it down into just the next few weeks doesn’t make it any better: I’ll take the dreaded-by-all AP Calculus exam, race a 5K, and help keep my soccer team in the running for playoffs this season. At one point today, I sat down and made a rudimentary list of positives coming up in the next couple of days, just to keep myself afloat during school. Here it is, slightly expanded.
1. I’ve already made playlists to listen to on the way to and from my soccer game tomorrow. I feel like I’m the only member of my team who actually likes away games, but there’s just something novel about going somewhere else to play. My school doesn’t even bother to get school buses for us anymore, so we cram the entire team into a couple of big old Turtle Top vans and the coaches flip coins to decide who has to drive. And the team always gets up to some antics once we get on the highway. In the past week there’s been a lot of food shared (or stolen), professional soccer watched surreptitiously on my phone, and songs on the radio mangled by a bus full of girls who are too happy to be there together to care about how they sound.
2. Today I passed a calculus quiz that played a big role in determining my semester grade. Solving as many integrals as possible in a 15-minute time limit may not be my cup of tea, but I felt good about it, and it must have showed.
3. Now that I have a bit of money of my own to spend, I’m learning how to treat myself to things. Not excessively—I’m still saving a the vast majority of what I earn. But every once in a while I can afford to drop a little bit to get myself something that’ll make me happy, and I think I’m starting to strike that perfect balance.
4. I’m feeling good about our game tomorrow. I’ve never actually played against this team—my freshman year I played for our junior varsity team against this school, and my sophomore year I rode the bench with bronchitis. But that means I know more about them than they do about me, and I tend to get underestimated on the field—especially my speed. But I’m feeling fast and ready and hungry. So far this season I’ve been a spark, a playmaker, even a game changer at times. But now I’m ready to add “goalscorer” to that list. ♦

“It’s not broken,” were the first words out of the physician’s mouth as she came in with my x-ray results. This encouraging statement was followed by an explanation that I had badly sprained my ankle and would need to wear an air cast for a week or two, because I just can’t catch a break when it comes to injuries, can I?
At soccer practice I usually love drills that pit us against each other one on one. I have a knack for nutmegging people—playing the ball between opponents’ feet to get past them—and enough explosive power to beat them in a sprint on the other side. One moment I was dribbling the ball towards my teammate, patiently reeling them in, waiting for them to try to steal the ball. Then I was mid-move, feinting to one side and darting to the other, when my ankle gave out spectacularly and I went down in a heap. I spent about five seconds trying to get up again, caught up in the adrenaline of the moment, before I realized it just wasn’t happening.
No amount of ice or ibuprofen could have stopped that ankle from swelling like it did. For the past few days I’ve been hobbling around feeling like I have nothing but a massive, club-like bruise at the end of my leg. It seems almost ridiculous that I could have gotten injured again so soon—I just went through months of physical therapy for my hip and hamstring, just got over my nasty cold. Don’t I deserve a few peaceful weeks of simply being able to play at full strength?
In soccer, jokes get thrown around about “ankle-breaking skill,” any kind of move or trick that spins defenders so off balance that they topple to the ground. Somehow I managed to break the wrong ankle. It’s just my luck. ♦

Sometimes you need to remind yourself that you were the one who carried you through the heartache, through the bad days and the worse days. You are the one who sits on the shower floor, and picks yourself up. You are the one who cries yourself to sleep, and turns around to smile at your loved ones. You are the one who takes care of your body, who feeds it, who clothes it, who tucks it into bed, and you should be proud of that. Having the strength to take care of yourself when everyone around you is trying to mess you up, ignore you, or is simply busy taking care of themselves—that is the strongest thing in the universe.
You need to remind yourself that you are important and that everything you do is an achievement. If all you do today is take a shower then good for you, you are clean. If all you do is get out of bed, then good for you, that’s awesome. If all you did was sleep, then good for you, at least you’re well rested. ♦

I waited for this moment for exactly four months, and now it’s here. We had our first practice of the high school season last night. I barely had time to think about the calf cramps and the burn of air in my lungs between push-ups and resistance sprints. With only two weeks until our first game—and against our longtime rivals, no less—to cram everything we can into daily two-hour sessions, knowing that we have to be game-fit and sharp on the ball when the time comes. But I felt good. I may not be the fastest sprinter or the best distance runner, but I keep plowing through whatever task is assigned to me, and when you put me on the ball, I will wriggle my way through any space I am allowed. I felt agile and confident and tough, even when the going got hard. When you love the process as much as the result, it’s easy to smile, even through the pain. ♦

At school, when we have more than one or two important tests or papers due in a single week, my friends and I will often deem it a “Hell Week” and resign ourselves to pushing through it together.
This, however, is a Hell Week unlike any I’ve ever experienced. I have more than a dozen odd assignments, quizzes, exams, and essays—I counted them—capped off with a lovely three-hour-long standardized test to begin deciding my future on Saturday morning.
I’m making it. Soccer is my biggest reprieve from studying; there’s no time to worry about my physics midterm when I’m burying a shot in the net. At home, I clamp my headphones over my ears and forget the rest of the world for half-hour blocks of time.
Only a few days until spring break.
Back to calculus. ♦
Lilly
Our first game is tomorrow and I haven’t been this nervous since I started my first varsity match in my freshman year.
I feel like I have reason to be anxious. We’ve only been practicing outside for a few days; we’re playing a new formation that puts me in a position with more responsibilities than last year; I know for a fact that I’m fighting tooth and nail for my place in the starting 11. Tomorrow is my chance to prove myself, give myself some breathing room. I can’t afford to not take it.
I know I can do it, even if I have to do it my way. Even if it’s scrappy play that hails back to the streets and the smooth gym floors instead of my last few seasons on grass.
I’m nervous now, but tomorrow I will take the field—hopefully with the starters—and I will be calm. I always am, no matter how worked up I get before the game. Once the starting whistle blows, everything else fades away. ♦

I’ve always wanted to work at a movie theater. This summer I need a job, so I decided to apply. The application was available online, and it was a lot less daunting than I’d assumed. They wanted my address, phone number, level of education—the usual things. The monotony of filling out forms like these has become peaceful with age. Often my mind wanders: I can think about almost anything while writing my year of birth, or dad’s cell phone number. 
In this particular instance, I started thinking of all my memories at the movies, like when my flip flop got stuck to the floor (sadly, forever) during Nacho Libre, or when two friends vehemently made out next to me during The Wolf of Wall Street, and I felt overwhelmingly surrounded by gluttony. Suddenly, a startling image of my movie theater experience came into memory. On the name tag of every employee I’ve ever seen, in every movie theater I’ve ever been to, is written their favorite movie. I don’t know my favorite movie. 
For years, this has caused me stress. Every first day of summer camp, personality quiz, and social media profile has required some variation of this question to be answered. I simply can’t. I love movies so much, and so many of them are so special to me. What really defines a “favorite” movie, anyway? There are movies I can watch a million times over and never get bored with—notably Titanic. But I don’t have the confidence in my femininity to put that movie on my tag. There are movies that have altered my being, which I constantly reflect on, but if I put Requiem for a Dream on my tag, I’d look sadistic. No Lars von Trier movies either. I can’t seem weird or too European to customers. There are movies which adhere to both of these assumed guidelines, but they have really long titles, like The Place Beyond the Pines, or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I wouldn’t want to put an elderly person through the challenge of having to read these titles in nine-point font on my three-inch-wide tag. Will anyone even read my tag? Does it really matter? It probably does. Is my boss going to make me explain my choice? 
I need to slow down. I haven’t gotten the job yet, and there’s a large possibility I won’t, due in part to the fact I’ve never had a real job before. The only people I can think to cite as references are babysitting clients (is that even what you call them?) who’ve arrived home to me playing on my cell phone while their kids were climbing bookshelves. I do this a lot, distract myself by dwelling on minutiae to avoid a bigger problem. 
What if I just didn’t put a movie on my tag, would they be cool with that? ♦

I’m back. I’m officially 100 percent back!!
A couple of weeks ago, I went to one of my club’s winter training sessions, and it was, shall we say, rough around the edges. I missed touches; I didn’t scrimmage; I was confident in only a few spare moments of success. But this weekend, my school offered two open gym sessions for both the girls’ and boys’ teams. Not everyone showed up—a lot of players participate in other school sports, so they had practices to attend—but those that did came to play, and for the first time in three months, I was one of them.
And for the first time in three months, I kicked ass.
It wasn’t perfect. The gym floor was dusty and slippery, and sometimes it was all any of us could do to keep our balance. But once I adjusted, I felt almost like my old self: quick passes, textbook steals, tiny touches. I connected quickly with one of the boys on my team, and it wasn’t long before everything clicked fully into place for one brief, shining moment. 
It had been almost a year since I had scored in a game situation. What if I choked? What if I missed the goal? What if I missed the ball?
Eleven years of muscle memory always win out over nerves. I hit the ball like I had never been away from the game—and nothing compares to the giddy, heady joy of scoring that first goal of a comeback.
I scored a lot. I missed a lot, too. Today, my legs, hips, and abs are heavy and sore with the strain I put them through. But I wouldn’t trade this feeling for the world. I still have a month until regular practices to get in shape—and get used to the intensity of the game again. This is my year. I’m ready to break some records. ♦

Through the darkness of the night appears the moon; from a thorny plant emerges a delicious fruit; beautiful flowers break through rocks and stones. That’s how life is, with all its pain and ugliness. It also gives you hope to lift you up and bring you strength. In spite of all the difficulties I’m facing, success finds its way to me, giving me sweet pleasure and pushing me to be optimistic about life.
I passed my educational training in the specialized camp for prosthetics, and I managed to make and install a prosthesis all by myself. I scored third in my class. I was hoping for better results, but it’s OK for a beginner like me. I will do my best to improve myself in time by practicing. My participation in this camp was of great benefit for me in terms of my qualification, as it was practical to what I’m studying. After two months, there will be a course in my field of study held by the Ministry of Health. This course will apparently be very useful for both my study and future career, but to register, you have to pay a certain amount of money. Honestly, I felt embarrassed to ask for the money from my mother when I know that she barely has enough to manage our lives, so I had to work. 
For the first time in my life, I have a job, and I will get paid for my own work. It’s been two weeks in the job now; I feel exhausted because I go out in the morning to my college and come back in the evening when I finish. As soon as I finish my lectures I run to my job, which is at a big company that sells electrical devices. My job is to explain the features of the devices to customers.
The thing that bothers me about this job is that I have to smile and accept whatever customers say without making any comment. Taking this job has put me under pressure that I could do without, but there’s no escaping it. The owner of the business is a kind man. He reminds me of my grandfather with his kindness, and I like and respect him. I am excited to have this experience, in spite of its disadvantages, as it will provide me with the money I need without asking my mother, who hasn’t yet found a job here. 
Life in the capital is not as easy as I thought it would be. Sometimes I blame myself and feel responsible for encouraging my family to come here. I was unaware of the costs here, such as rent, study expenses, and other expenditures. For example, a week ago, I got hepatitis. We spent a lot of money on doctors, tests, and medicines. It made my mother very worried that the infection would spread to my sisters and brother, and she did her best to avoid that. She’s a poor thing, my mother. I always fear her strength will weaken and she will lose her smile, which is the secret to our life. 
Moving to the capital changed us a lot. My 11-year-old brother, Muhammad, no longer settles for little after seeing the difference between here and home. He’s also become aggressive. I don’t know why. He has lost his ability to communicate with others, especially adults. He has become bad-tempered, unwilling to listen to what my mother tells him, and his reaction to everything is always to attack. My mother is very worried about him, and she’s trying her best to correct his behavior, especially now that he’s in the beginning of his teenage years.
As for my 16-year-old sister, Lana, she’s adapting fast. My mother fears for her in this messy new atmosphere, where it’s easy to slip and make mistakes. As for the middle one, Maya, who is 17, she’s preparing to graduate from high school. It’s aching my mother’s heart that she hasn’t been able to provide her with tutors or a good school. She clings to her books, dreaming of a great future.
It’s weird how things have changed. Is it the place that changed us, or is it our financial situation that’s affecting us? I don’t know. But in spite of all this, I feel that a wonderful great event is ahead of us. It could be a golden job opportunity for my mom, or a chance for my family to travel, or…I don’t know, but something inside me is giving me hope. I truly believe that life will smile at me. Tragedies can break glass, but they make iron harder, and I won’t be easily broken, ever. ♦

Here is the difference between myself at present and myself only a few months ago: In November, I complained heavily and repeatedly about the monotony of life, citing all of the things I should be doing, but never actually following through with them. In February, I am finally doing so.
I think part of that change has been realizing that routine ≠ monotony. Some things I am forced to factor into my daily life: school, gym, shower, homework, sleep. Others are regular, self-imposed habits: studying Spanish, going to open gyms on the weekends, building in time to watch a soccer match or two during the week. The fact that these are all invariably a part of my week is not a bad thing. What’s important is switching up the way I do them, so I listen to a different album or playlist on the way to school every morning. I add to my Spanish or French vocabulary every time I study, even if it’s only a couple of words. I change the exercises I do in the weight room; the intervals I run on the treadmill.
Here is the difference between myself at present and myself only a few months ago: In November, I was laid up in bed injured, without purpose, wondering if everything I wanted to achieve was worth the struggle it took to get there. In February, I am struggling, but it is already worth it. ♦

Once a year, my entire high school takes the week off from regular classes. Instead we’re offered the opportunity to teach and/or take courses that we design ourselves. Some are taught by students, and others by teachers, parents, and even professors from the local university. My schedule last week started with debates on the true author of the works of William Shakespeare and ended with two-hour field trips to supercomputing labs on the university’s campus.
Not all classes have to be academic. Every morning my friends and I hurried through the cold to the gymnasium down the street where we have our P.E. classes. We stripped off our coats and replaced them with plastic chest plates, lumpy white jackets, and masks made of woven metal mesh—and then someone stuck swords in our hands. Of all things, one of the braver underclassmen decided to offer a fencing class this year, and I signed up as soon as I saw it. I mean, who wouldn’t?
We only had four hours of class time, total, and most of that was spent sizing equipment and practicing footwork. On the last day, we finally picked up our swords to learn lunges and parries and have our first duels.
I’m not known for my hand-eye coordination, but I find that I work well under pressure: When someone’s coming at me with a sword—even if I know it’s my friend behind the menacing mask—adrenaline tends to kick in. I won my first three duels by fairly close margins, relying on speed to find weak points in my opponents’ defenses, then held off a fellow student and my P.E. teacher when they decided to take me on simultaneously. (I accomplished this by unashamedly running them in circles until they both got too tired to continue.)
The other classes tended to blur together a bit. Teenagers, at least at my school, are only so coherent before noon. But I’m not going to forget that fencing class that I took on a complete whim—something totally foreign to me that ended up being 10 times the amount of fun I expected. Sometimes it feels good to be out of my comfort zone. ♦

The X-ray technician orders me to lie down on the table while she preps the machine. I put on the gown she gives me and recline, turning my toes in like I’m told, my hands falling loosely out to the side. She repositions me a few times between scans, bending my knees, adjusting the angle of my hips. Then we’re done, and I get dressed and pad comfortably back out into the lobby. “The results will be in later tonight, maybe tomorrow morning,” the receptionist tells my mom, and then we’re free to go.
It’s a precaution, simply to make sure that my hip pain isn’t due to a hernia or anything other than a muscle strain. I’m not expecting anything out of the ordinary to show up in my hip. I’m definitely not expecting my mom to come home and say, “Well, they told me it’s a fracture.”
And it’s not even in my hip. I have what’s called an avulsion fracture where my hamstring connects to my pelvis, meaning that a tiny piece of bone got torn away from the main mass because of some physical strain. But the last time I injured my hamstring was years ago. Until tomorrow, when I go back to see an orthopedist, I won’t know if the fracture that showed up on the X-ray is recent or long healed. Two doctors’ appointments tomorrow (first with the orthopedist, then my physical therapist), my first week back at school—it’s a bit much to be happening all at once.
For some reason, when I heard the diagnosis, all I did was laugh. Maybe being away from the action when I couldn’t continue physically for the past couple of months has increased my mental strength. A year ago, you couldn’t pay me to stay on the treadmill for longer than a 10-minute warm-up, and now I sigh a little when my 50-minute timer beeps and the belt slows to a stop. (Which seems idiotic in hindsight, knowing my diagnosis now, but it didn’t cause me any irregular pain as I was doing it.)
Whatever happens tomorrow, whatever my final diagnosis turns out to be, I will recover from it. “You gotta try a little harder, you’re the comeback kid,” sings Sleigh Bells’ Alexis Krauss. I will run again. I will play again. ♦

Our hearts and feelings can swing like a pendulum, as I discovered in a recent rather special adventure that I had. I was invited to my friend’s wedding, and I accepted the invitation because they insisted (in addition to a tiny feeling I had that I wanted to go). Maybe it’s because my soul was longing for a bit of happiness. I was scared and hesitant because I had completely forgotten wedding and party traditions, as they have vanished in my city. Weddings in my town are now only held inside people’s homes, and most marriages are arranged without a wedding or a celebration in fear of earlier raids and recent bombings. Anyways, all these matters are trivial when there’s chemistry and harmony between the couple.
I prepared myself for the party, and if you only knew how much trouble I went through, because I found myself unable to use the hair dryer that had been laying there for three years. In the end, I did my best to look like the other girls. I walked into the hall with my friends, and it was very exciting, lights everywhere and loud songs echoing all around, and there were women and girls moving around elegant tables, all beautifully dressed with the finest hairstyles, exchanging polite smiles. As for the bride, she looked like a queen in her white dress with her friends and relatives around her like her maids, a charming scene that I hadn’t seen in four years. I didn’t even think it existed in this new world. I was wide-eyed at everything I saw. I was staring at everything as if I was a Neanderthal looking through a window to the 21st century, because those years of pain, agony and deprivation of all joy are not something to be underestimated. This is how I felt, although no matter how I explain it, you cannot begin to imagine my fascination.
I was attracted by the sight of the girls dancing gracefully and skilfully. I was invited to dance with the bride, but I refused because I knew I didn’t know how to dance anymore. I used to be one of the best when I was a teenager, when all I cared about was having fun and going wild, unlike now.
The truth is, I wished I could dance madly and be myself again for few moments, but I only stood there and watched, not wanting to be made fun of.
In the middle of the party they announced the arrival of the groom, who had just come from the men’s party to take his bride. There was a special song for his entrance, and the bride moved forward to meet him after she covered her face with her veil. The groom came and lifted her veil and kissed her cheek. In that moment a weird feeling touched the female inside me. My heart moved, and I watched how they put the rings on each other’s fingers and kissed and danced like two little birds, unaware of the crowd around them.
The camera was following them, and a big screen was showing pictures of them as children and teenagers, and of their engagement and wedding. It was so beautiful and exciting. Then the groom gave a little speech thanking the bride for agreeing to marry him, and she did the same, and then she threw the bouquet of roses and the girls rushed to catch it, each of them hoping to be the next bride.
Finally, the groom took his bride away in a decorated fancy car, and the party was over and I went back home with images of the wedding in my mind. When I put my head on my pillow, tears started pouring down my face. I’m not sure why! Is it because I was feeling sad about my hometown and what happened to it, and the difference between here and there? I don’t think so. I think it’s just me feeling sorry for myself and my situation. This wedding allowed joy to sneak into my heart and shake it, and revived my sense of femininity after its long slumber. It provoked my desire to be a bride, and I started to imagine how that would be against my will. 
But I wonder if it’s possible for me to come out of this crisis as a normal girl willing to love, marry, and have a family. Maybe, but how can we forget about the reality that I am but a sick person with no feelings? I have no interest in men anymore, so how can I ever fall in love and become a lover?! Impossible! And if I ever do, I don’t think it would be a successful story, because the crisis ruined all beautiful things inside me in a way that they cannot be mended. Most important, there isn’t a single person in the world that I can trust, thus, I cannot fall in love with anyone. In the end, life keeps swinging us between dreams and wishes, pain and hope, and eventually what happens to us is only what’s already destined to happen, so I only hope the unknown will be more merciful and gentle to me. I only hope. ♦

There have been moments where I’ve feared I would have to start over completely, and there have been moments that have reassured me otherwise.
Yesterday was my first day back at official training since the injury. My two closest friends from the team were there to keep my head up, and there were times when I needed it. I tried not to curse myself every time my feet were in the wrong place, my steps too heavy, my passes too hard. The gym floor was slippery, and I was scared to stretch too far for the ball, fearing the flare of pain in my groin that I’ve become all too familiar with. At the end of the hour, I sat down a few minutes early to stretch and watch my teammates play, as out of breath from the nerves as from the exertion.
Looking back, it wasn’t all muttered swears and misplaced touches. There were moments where I found myself falling back into my old rhythms, dragging the ball across the floor like there were magnets sewn into my cleats. The speedy moves and accelerations we practiced would have felt like they were tearing me in half two months ago, but, yesterday, they were completely painless.
I know I’m not as agile as I was…yet. I can’t play as long or as intensely as I used to…yet. But I’m getting there. I’ve been going to physical therapy; I’ve been throwing myself at the treadmill with Angel Haze shouting, “You the only person alive who holds the key to your healing,” in my ear. In the wilderness of exams and essays and standardized tests that is school, recovering from this injury is almost an escape. It has an endpoint. A deadline. One that I’m positive that I’m going to meet. ♦

My school is not known for the quality of its dances, and this one is no exception. It’s oddly cold in the building, my feet hurt from my teetering heels, and the bass vibrates just a little too deeply through my lungs. But I go anyway, knowing I can count on at least a couple of good songs to play between too-heavy bass and unintelligible lyrics. When it matters, my friends pry my phone out of my hands and drag me out onto the dance floor.
“We were victims of the night,” we scream along to “Walk The Moon” at one another. “The chemical, physical kryptonite—”
The music still isn’t ideal—one of my friends and I have been pushing to DJ a dance for years and have always been denied the opportunity, so maybe we set our expectations a little high. But the place warms up fast with people in it, and every once in a while there’s something we can really dance to, and were we really hoping for much more, anyway?
Besides, the best part of the night is always getting ready. It’s a flurry of “Here, use my liquid eyeliner,” and, “Do you have earrings I can borrow?” and, “I can’t believe I forgot Spandex!” It’s dancing before we even get to the party, it’s fixing each other’s bra straps, and eating whatever we can before we put our lipstick on, and humming along to One Direction songs.
We even Skype our friend through the process. She’s doing an exchange student program in Turkey this year, and most of us haven’t seen her face in months. “It’s 1 AM here,” she says, “so I can’t talk too loudly. I might wake my host family up.” But she stays on the line with us for over an hour and kisses the screen goodbye. ♦
